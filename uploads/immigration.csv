B.P.J. | Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/little-v-hecox-and-west-virginia-v-b-p-j/,"Transgender students seeking to join women’s and girls’ sports teams, Lindsay Hecox and B.P.J, a minor using her initials, challenged the laws in separate lawsuits.
To begin, Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 classify students based on sex.
And West Virginia’s HB 3293 uses B.P.J.’s sex—“based solely” on her “reproductive biology and genetics at birth”—to determine that she cannot join girls’ athletics teams and sports.
Similarly, West Virginia’s HB 3293 bars all transgender girls and women from playing on athletic teams for women or girls.
The Idaho and West Virginia laws cannot survive heightened judicial review as applied here and thus violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.","Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 expressly classify students based on their sex assigned at birth and prohibit all transgender women and girls from joining women’s and girls’ sports teams across all levels of competition at any public educational institution. These statutes also subject cisgender and transgender women and girls—but not any men or boys—to invasive sex-verification procedures to determine their eligibility to join public-school sports teams. Transgender students seeking to join women’s and girls’ sports teams, Lindsay Hecox and B.P.J, a minor using her initials, challenged the laws in separate lawsuits.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit considered whether these laws’ sex-based exclusions of Hecox and B.P.J. satisfied intermediate scrutiny, the doctrinal test required for sex-based classifications to pass constitutional muster. Longstanding Supreme Court precedent underscores that classifications that treat individuals differently based on their sex must “serve important governmental objectives” and “the discriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.” In concluding that the challenged statutes fall short of this demanding standard, the Ninth Circuit and the Fourth Circuit both acknowledged a government interest in promoting competitive fairness in athletics but rejected the notion that, as applied to Hecox and B.P.J., categorical bans on the participation of all transgender women and girls on women’s and girls’ sports teams substantially furthered that interest. Instead, such sweeping prohibitions reduce these students to the mere fact of their sex—and deny them the equal opportunity to participate in public-school athletics and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.

In November 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in support of the student athletes. Our brief makes three principal points.

First, the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality under the law, prohibiting states from denying to “any person” the “equal protection of the laws.” As the Amendment’s text and history make clear, the Equal Protection Clause establishes a broad guarantee of equality for all persons, securing the same rights and protection under the law regardless of race, sex, or class. Its framers consciously chose universal language intended to secure equal rights for all people. Under the Amendment’s plain text and original meaning, this sweeping guarantee of equality applies to everyone, and states may not impose invidious class-based discrimination that bans students from public-school activities, including sports, based on their sex.

Second, the Nineteenth Amendment buttressed the Fourteenth Amendment’s promise of equality. Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment imposed a penalty of reduced congressional representation on states that denied or abridged the right to vote to any of the state’s “male inhabitants,” implicitly sanctioning the disenfranchisement of women. Women’s-rights activists celebrated the Fourteenth Amendment’s universal embrace of equality, but rejected the notion that our foundational promises of democracy, freedom, and equality were real when half the population was excluded from voting based on sex. Demanding fundamental constitutional change, women’s-rights activists finally succeeded with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. The Nineteenth Amendment deepened the Fourteenth Amendment’s core promise of equality, guaranteeing equal citizenship to all regardless of sex and rejecting state-sponsored discrimination rooted in sex-based stereotypes about physical bodies and social roles.

Third, consistent with the text and history of the Fourteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, the Supreme Court has long held that “gender-based classifications . . . require ‘an exceedingly persuasive justification’ in order to survive constitutional scrutiny.” Idaho’s and West Virginia’s laws cannot satisfy this standard. To begin, Idaho’s HB 500 and West Virginia’s HB 3293 classify students based on sex. Idaho’s HB 500 bars Lindsay Hecox from competing on the women’s sports teams she attempted to join because the law identifies her as a “student[] of the male sex” based on her sex assigned at birth. And West Virginia’s HB 3293 uses B.P.J.’s sex—“based solely” on her “reproductive biology and genetics at birth”—to determine that she cannot join girls’ athletics teams and sports. Next, these sex-based classifications do not further the state governments’ stated goals of maintaining competitive fairness in women’s sports. Idaho’s law is remarkably overbroad and covers students who have no relevant advantage over cisgender woman athletes, including Hecox, who is barred from women’s sports teams even though she is prescribed hormone therapy that, as the Ninth Circuit noted, has dramatically altered her body and removed physiological traits that would differentiate her from cisgender peers. Similarly, West Virginia’s HB 3293 bars all transgender girls and women from playing on athletic teams for women or girls. But banning B.P.J.—a transgender girl who received puberty blockers and is undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy that “cause[s] her to experience [the same] physical changes . . . typically experienced by cisgender girls”—does not advance competitive fairness. Overall, the challenged classifications deny Hecox and B.P.J. consideration as individuals, subjecting them to overbroad and inaccurate stereotypes about their physiology and abilities based simply on the fact of their sex. The Idaho and West Virginia laws cannot survive heightened judicial review as applied here and thus violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-11-17 15:56:36.656462

He also told deputies that the man displayed a badge before ordering the teenager out of the car at gunpoint.
Greg Kirakosian, the attorney representing the family, says that Rodriguez is an agent with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The teenager and his parents are Mexican-American U.S. citizens, Kirakosian told CBS Los Angeles.
They have not yet confirmed the family attorney's statement that Rodriguez is a federal agent.","An off-duty public officer has been arrested after he allegedly pointed a gun at a teenager in Temecula before detaining him last week.

It happened on Nov. 10 at around 10:40 p.m., when Riverside County Sheriff's Department deputies were dispatched to the Sommers Bend community after learning of someone who was ""brandishing a firearm"" in the area, according to a news release from RSO.

Upon arrival, deputies spoke with the reporting party, who told them that his 17-year-old son was ""stopped by a subject in the roadway while driving in a residential neighborhood."" He also told deputies that the man displayed a badge before ordering the teenager out of the car at gunpoint.

The teen was eventually released to his parents after complying, deputies said. Family members say that he was on his way home from a party when the incident happened.

Investigators with the Southwest Sheriff's Station's Investigation Bureau assumed the case and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Gerardo Rodriguez.

Greg Kirakosian, the attorney representing the family, says that Rodriguez is an agent with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The teenager and his parents are Mexican-American U.S. citizens, Kirakosian told CBS Los Angeles.

""My client thought, and his family thought, he was either gonna be shot dead, or he was gonna be taken by ICE that night,"" Kirakosian said.

Rodriguez was arrested at his home without incident by RSO investigators, at which point a search warrant was authored and served. Deputies discovered and collected evidence related to the investigation.

Home surveillance video of the incident was shared by Kirakosian, which shows a man they say is Rodriguez pacing along the street while holding what looks to be a gun. As a pickup truck approaches, Rodriguez can be heard shouting, ""Freeze, police! Put the car in park right now!"" while pointing the alleged gun at the vehicle. He can then be seen opening the front door and telling the teenager to sit down.

Kirakosian claims that Rodriguez demanded the teenager's ID, told him he knew where he lived and threatened to investigate his family for more than 10 minutes before he finally let him go when neighbors intervened.

""I think he and his family are scared, just like everybody else in Southern California, all the way to Chicago, are scared, and this is getting so out of hand,"" Kirakosian said. ""ICE agents are doing this when they're off the clock, at home, in their pajamas, they're using their badge and their gun, and investigating people in the neighborhood.""

Rodriguez was booked for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer, according to the Sheriff's Department news release.

CBS Los Angeles has reached out to DHS, ICE and Customs and Border Protection for comment on the incident. They have not yet confirmed the family attorney's statement that Rodriguez is a federal agent.

As their investigation continues, RSO investigators ask anyone with further details to contact them at (951) 696-3000.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/17/0b4fabc3-e067-4279-bbdd-4c032d15ad98/thumbnail/1200x630/fb77ba82c76bf9db5fc56e6a3a201aa8/temecula-federal-agent.png,N,,2025-11-17 16:57:38.437864

The figures, reported by CBS News, come as a federal judge considers ordering the release of hundreds of detainees after finding that many arrests may have violated an existing court order that restricts warrantless detentions.
Just 2.6% of those detained were found to have prior offenses that the government deemed significant enough to fall under the ""high public safety risk"" classification.
Judge Cummings emphasized that the court's role is not to shape immigration policy but to ensure compliance with existing orders.

The list, released as part of ongoing litigation over potentially unlawful arrests, also identified one person as a national security risk and another as a ""foreign criminal,"" but provided no additional details.

The figures, reported by CBS News, come as a federal judge considers ordering the release of hundreds of detainees after finding that many arrests may have violated an existing court order that restricts warrantless detentions. The court-required list includes each person's name, country of citizenship, and whether they remain in custody, were deported, or left the country voluntarily.

According to the government's own assessments, 78% of the 607 detainees were categorized as posing a low public safety risk, while only 7% were considered high risk — and not all in that category had criminal histories. Just 2.6% of those detained were found to have prior offenses that the government deemed significant enough to fall under the ""high public safety risk"" classification.

Eric Balliet, a retired Homeland Security Investigations special agent with 25 years of experience, told CBS News that the numbers contradict repeated statements by the Trump administration that operations in Chicago were targeting ""the worst of the worst:""

""It confuses the public. It certainly instills a sense of fear,"" he said. ""To go after violent criminals, that's a lot of work. That's a lot of effort. That's a lot of time, and candidly, from the people I've talked to, the department and the agency doesn't want to expense that time, that strategic and operational planning to actually get the worst of the worst""

The arrests are now at the center of a broader legal challenge. On November 12, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings ruled that hundreds of ICE arrests carried out in Chicago and across Illinois may have violated the Castañon Nava Consent Decree, a 2022 order that bars federal agents from detaining individuals without warrants or probable cause. The judge found that DHS and ICE had repeatedly violated the decree, and that field offices were incorrectly told it had been canceled.

Cummings ordered that 615 people detained between June 2 and October 7 be released into Alternatives to Detention programs on bond by November 21. The court also mandated that the government produce a full list of all people detained by ICE and Border Patrol during Operation Midway Blitz — believed to exceed 3,000 arrests — including risk assessments and country-of-origin information.

In a FOX News interview, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said more redeployments were imminent and suggested Chicago could again become a target. He also signaled plans for more arrests, saying, ""If he releases those 650, we're going to apprehend 1,650 on the streets of Chicago.""

For years, advocates have criticized ICE for using it in immigration enforcement and surveillance operations.
But per the ruling, ICE agents in Los Angeles can legally constitute reasonable suspicion on the basis of assumed race or ethnicity until the merits of the case are decided.
And in Los Angeles earlier this month, ICE agents took a toddler during another immigration raid at a Home Depot in Cypress Park.
He also justifies the Trump Administration’s argument that such metrics fall under the definition of reasonable suspicion, writing, “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion .","Outside a Home Depot in Westlake, Los Angeles, it was typical for day workers to gather in the parking lot to find work with contractors and homeowners visiting the store. But on June 6, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conducted violent immigration raids across the city, white vans rushed into the parking lot and unloaded masked officers who, after asking around in Spanish for day workers, handcuffed and arrested people.

The raid, along with a similar one that occurred at an apparel warehouse in another part of the city on the same day, prompted Los Angeles court district judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) a little over a month later covering several Southern California counties. Frimpong wrote that her decision was based on “ample evidence that seizures occurred based solely upon” one of four factors—an individual’s apparent race or ethnicity, their accent or use of Spanish, their presence at a farm or known work pickup site, or the type of work they do.

Using race to determine reasonable suspicion is an issue that has been argued in front of the Supreme Court for decades. In the long history of government surveillance, detention, and deportation, the use of race by multiple federal government agencies in a variety of contexts is nothing new. For years, advocates have criticized ICE for using it in immigration enforcement and surveillance operations.

The Los Angeles case was soon brought to the Supreme Court, which, on September 8, voted 6 to 3 on ideological lines, issuing an opinion in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo overturning the TRO. The decision was unsigned, which in Court precedent typically indicates that the case matter is non-controversial. It also only applies to the restraining order—not the merits of the case as a whole—which will be debated in future litigation surrounding the raids. But per the ruling, ICE agents in Los Angeles can legally constitute reasonable suspicion on the basis of assumed race or ethnicity until the merits of the case are decided. To immigration experts, the decision has “effectively legalized racial profiling.”

Now, the city of Los Angeles and its communities are grappling with the practical implications of the Court’s decision. Street vendors with legal residencies in the Boyle Heights neighborhood have begun carrying their passports, Real ID cards, and green cards with them at all times, making the difficult choice between asserting their right to exist without proof of residency and avoiding the risk of being targeted by an ICE agent and not having their documentation. In an attempt to prevent further fallout, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency in mid-October which lays the groundwork to provide eviction moratoriums for tenants too afraid to leave their homes for fear of arrest.

The lower courts and legal advocates, including Immigration Defenders Law Center managing attorney Brynna Bolt, have argued that the use of the four factors by ICE agents during patrols in Los Angeles—and around the country—is purely racial profiling. “The individuals that we’ve seen swept up, they are primarily Latino, primarily Spanish speaking, primarily working or arrested in proximity to places where people work low-wage jobs,” Bolt tells The Progressive. “We have clients who have lawful immigration status who have been swept up in the raids.”

Though the Supreme Court decision only pertains to Los Angeles and the surrounding areas, it signals the permissibility of racial profiling in the eyes of the Court. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh claims that immigration stops would be a small inconvenience to citizens or legal residents. But in Ventura County, one of seven in California where racial profiling is now temporarily sanctioned, a U.S. citizen was arrested and detained by masked agents who subsequently refused to allow him to produce identification verifying his legal status.

The man, George Retes, is an Army veteran who was held in an immigration detention center for three days and denied access to a lawyer and a phone call. Retes missed his daughter’s third birthday while in detention. “It would have taken them two minutes to check my papers and confirm that I was a citizen,” Retes wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Instead, they arrested me because I was there.” According to the Federal Tort Claims Act, Retes must wait six months after filing an administrative claim with ICE before he can file a lawsuit against the U.S government for being unconstitutionally detained, which he plans to do.

Meanwhile, ICE stops have become increasingly chaotic and violent. In September, an ICE agent fatally shot a man in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, claiming the man had dragged one of the officers with his car; body camera footage released later recorded the officer describing his injuries as “nothing major.” In Boston, Massachusetts, a family has accused ICE of using their five-year-old daughter to lure her father out to agents for arrest. And in Los Angeles earlier this month, ICE agents took a toddler during another immigration raid at a Home Depot in Cypress Park.

The opinion has had a chilling effect on citizens of color throughout the country, some of whom have begun carrying their passports, deleting social media apps from their phone before trips, and canceling trips altogether, as residents of all documentation statuses fear being swept up in ICE raids.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has denied that any use of racial profiling, writing on X that “allegations that DHS law enforcement officers engage in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE” and calling the criticisms “anti-ICE LIES.”

Even though immigration policies and programs have been technically considered colorblind, or race-neutral, due to a Civil Rights Era overhaul, immigration enforcement has in practice long employed racial profiling. “That’s always been an issue with immigration,” Bolt says. As a result, immigrant communities of color often fear going out due to pervasive stories of deportation and potential raids that manifest into emotional trauma.

As government surveillance ramped up in the decades after the 9/11 attacks, DHS has employed social media surveillance that specifically targets Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Muslim individuals. Both the DHS and the FBI use Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—which was just expanded by Congress in 2024—to disproportionately surveil Middle Eastern and South Asian Americans, coordinating with corporations like Meta, Google, Microsoft, Verizon and AT&T.

In 2017, the FBI similarly surveilled Black people in an intelligence assessment entitled “Black Identity Extremists Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers.” The agency’s actions echoed its historical surveillance of civil rights and Black Panther Party leaders, which was used as a part of a campaign to “discredit, or otherwise neutralize” Black power movements and which resulted in the deaths of Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.

Now, ICE is following suit by bolstering its surveillance capabilities. The agency is planning to set up intelligence-gathering centers in Vermont and California where contracted senior analysts and researchers can use a combination of social media and law enforcement and federal government database searches to target individuals for deportation.

As Wired reported last month, previous ICE surveillance tools have been the subject of lawsuits over their use in targeting civilians, threatening privacy rights, and sidestepping warrant requirements by collecting “vast amounts of data with no clear link to its enforcement mandate.”

In California, Bolt says that the use of race by immigration agents was already evident: “The federal government has made clear in this case and in the public square and by its own actions that they’re going to continue doing what they’re doing, and that the enforcement operation in Southern California is being driven by race.”

While there was no official written opinion in Noem, Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion downplays the detrimental effects of immigration stops. He also justifies the Trump Administration’s argument that such metrics fall under the definition of reasonable suspicion, writing, “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion . . . . However, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Kavanaugh’s claim cites the Supreme Court precedent set in 1975’s United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, which found that the Fourth Amendment did not justify Border Patrol agents stopping individuals solely based on the assumption of “Mexican ancestry,” but that race could be used in conjunction with other factors. In Noem, he states that, “Whether an officer has reasonable suspicion depends on the totality of the circumstances.” The current case, he argues, includes the known presence of “an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area” and that they “tend” to work certain jobs and “do not speak much English.”

Legal experts, including Rory Little writing for SCOTUSblog, warn that if Kavanaugh’s concurrent opinion in the temporary decision holds weight further down the road, “his view would constitute a significant doctrinal shift in ‘reasonable suspicion’ Fourth Amendment doctrine.”

The original case, which will determine the merit of using racial characteristics in constituting reasonable suspicion, is currently pending in district court. How the Supreme Court will rule on it is unclear, but their decisions in Noem have given some indication of where the Justices stand. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor spears Kavanaugh’s concurrence, claiming that it “relegates the interests of U.S. citizens and individuals with legal status to a single sentence.”

Sotomayor also reiterates an interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that requires federal agents to rely on “specific articulable facts” to form a “particularized and objective basis” when determining reasonable suspicion, as was decided in 1981 in United States v. Cortez. Traits such as apparent race or language spoken, Sotomayor writes, are facts that “apply to a large category of presumably innocent people,” and therefore cannot indicate illegal presence any more than they could indicate legal presence.

The Supreme Court’s willingness to permit the use of race in Noem remains a stark example of the double standards that it has used when deciding racial cases in the past. As Stanford Law School professor Jennifer Chacón writes in Border Criminologies, “only in immigration policing cases does the Court explicitly reason that someone’s (racialized) appearance alone gets a law enforcement officer almost 100 percent of the way toward ‘reasonable suspicion.’ ”

Still, while Noem has legalized its use in immigration enforcement, the federal government has long been used in the United States to target certain individuals, citizens or not, and it likely won’t stop anytime soon.",https://progressive.org/downloads/22313/download/ICERacialProfiling.jpg?cb=9019bf0529238482c98d86dc90a4ab11&w=1200,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:37.994366

April 7

A senior lawyer in the Office of Immigration Litigation, Erez Reuveni, acknowledged in court that the Trump administration wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran construction worker who lived in Maryland for a dozen years, to El Salvador, where he was being held in a notorious maximum-security prison. In previous administrations, including Trump’s first term, the government routinely worked to get people back when they were deported without legal authority. In this case, however, Bondi put Reuveni on leave and then fired him.

Mr. Trump dismissed the emails as a “hoax” to drive attention away from the government shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats.","But with beef prices approaching $10 per pound, the Trump administration is scrambling to bring them down, including by lowering tariffs on beef imports and trying to address a shortage of cows. With many Americans frustrated by Mr. Trump’s tariffs, his advisers have been straining to blame the high cost of hamburgers — and anything else — on anyone other than the president.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to explain high beef prices over the weekend by blaming undocumented immigrants, saying they were bringing sick cows into the United States. Mr. Bessent said that forced the Trump administration to halt imports of beef from Mexico, which is the second-largest supplier of beef to the United States.

“Because of the mass immigration, a disease that we’d been rid of in North America made its way up from South America, as these migrants brought some of their cattle with them,” Mr. Bessent said on Fox News on Sunday.

The Treasury Department did not respond to a request for an explanation about Mr. Bessent’s suggestion that sick cows were being brought from Mexico across the border. Mr. Bessent was referring to the spread of New World screwworm, a parasite that the United States has been working with Mexico to eradicate.

Mr. Bessent said that the Trump administration is “laser focused” on fixing the problem and added: “This is the perfect storm, again something we inherited.”

The Trump administration has been taking other measures to contend with rising beef costs. Mr. Trump announced this month that he asked the Department of Justice to investigate meat companies that he said were driving up prices through “illicit collusion.”

Last month, Mr. Trump said that he would ease import restrictions on beef from Argentina in an effort to lower prices in the United States. The plan angered American cattle ranchers, who argue that meat prices are reasonable and that more competition will harm their businesses.

Mr. Trump’s economic advisers have acknowledged that it will not be easy to get grocery prices to fall meaningfully in the near term and have instead focused on wage increases to make the case that “affordability” is improving. That is a shift from Mr. Trump’s promise as a presidential candidate last year to lower the price of groceries.

Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC on Monday that “purchasing power” has improved under the Trump administration and lamented that the president is being blamed for failing to reduce food costs faster.

“There’s a million things that we’re doing to fix this problem,” Mr. Hassett said. “It’s just kind of astonishing to me that the cost problem is somehow being blamed on us.”

Ms. Evans, like Mr. Richardson, lacks experience in emergency management, which is a legal requirement to lead FEMA.

Ms. Evans has played a central role in the Trump administration’s efforts to cut costs at FEMA, according to three people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.

Earlier this year, Ms. Evans rejected many FEMA spending requests before they could reach the desk of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has imposed a requirement that she personally approve any expense over $100,000, the three people said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said Mr. Richardson was returning to the private sector and thanked him for his work “refocusing the agency to deliver swift resources to Americans in crisis.”

President Trump has suggested eliminating or overhauling FEMA, with an eye toward shifting more responsibility for disaster response to the states. The administration is expected to release a report in the coming weeks detailing its plans to reshape FEMA’s role in disasters across the country.

That report “will inform this Administration’s ongoing efforts to fundamentally restructure FEMA, transforming it from its current form into a streamlined, mission-focused disaster-response force,” Ms. McLaughlin said in a statement.

Ms. Evans, who had worked in the first Trump administration, was previously national director of the U.S. Cyber Challenge, a private initiative focused on building the country’s cybersecurity work force, and worked in information technology for her own company, according to her LinkedIn profile. She served as the chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget during the George W. Bush administration.

Mr. Richardson, who served in the Marines, was named to the role of acting FEMA administrator in May, replacing Cameron Hamilton, who was pushed out a day after telling members of Congress that FEMA was vital to communities “in their greatest times of need” and should not be eliminated. His resignation was first reported by The Washington Post.

When he was tapped for FEMA, Mr. Richardson was the assistant secretary at the Homeland Security Department’s office for countering weapons of mass destruction. Mr. Richardson maintained both jobs.

After Mr. Richardson joined FEMA, some of his employees expressed concern about his lack of experience. He told employees in June that he did not know the United States had a hurricane season — a comment that unnerved FEMA employees who heard it. The agency later said Mr. Richardson was joking.

On his first full day as acting administrator, Mr. Richardson told the agency’s employees that if any of them tried to obstruct his agenda, “I will run right over you.”

In a statement responding to Mr. Richardson’s resignation, Representative Frank Pallone, Democrat of New Jersey, said, “good riddance.”

“Americans deserve a FEMA leader with at least the most basic core competencies in emergency management, something David Richardson never demonstrated,” Mr. Pallone said.

The future of FEMA is unclear. In June, President Trump said he wanted to eliminate FEMA in November after the hurricane season ended and move emergency management efforts “back to the state level.”

After deadly Texas floods in July, when many Americans were focused on the rescue efforts, the administration’s rhetoric softened and officials spoke instead of reforming the agency.

Still, more than 2,000 employees have left FEMA since Mr. Trump took office, accounting for about one-third of the agency’s permanent work force. Those who resigned included some of the agency’s most accomplished leaders. A task force of local, state and federal emergency managers has been studying reforms to the agency that could raise the threshold for a disaster that warrants federal intervention, change how disaster aid is paid to states, and end FEMA’s role in the long term recovery of disaster-struck communities.

The panel, known as the FEMA Review Council, was required to release its recommendations by Sunday under an executive order Mr. Trump issued in May. An administration officials said the report is expected by the end of this year.

Emergency management officials around the country are eager for its release to understand what they can expect from FEMA in the future.

“We’re all anxiously waiting to see what it says,” Bryan Fisher, director of the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said Saturday at a resource fair for victims of Typhoon Halong, which hit Southwestern Alaska last month.

Since the Texas floods, there has not been a major test of the agency’s evolving disaster response strategy, under which FEMA has added new hurdles to some grant programs and stretched the limits of a dwindling pot of money used to pay for disaster aid. In recent months, Mr. Trump has declared federal disasters in Alaska, where remnants of a typhoon devastated coastal villages, and across the Plains, where severe storms and tornadoes damaged communities.

But the wildfire season has been calmer than expected in the West. And it has been a relatively mild Atlantic hurricane season in the East, with the most destructive storms avoiding landfall in the United States.

In his ruling, Judge Fitzpatrick said that when Ms. Halligan appeared — by herself — in front of the grand jury in September to seek an indictment accusing Mr. Comey of lying to and obstructing Congress in 2020 testimony, she made at least two “fundamental and highly prejudicial” misstatements of the law. He also pointed out that the grand jury materials he ordered her to turn over to him for his review this month appeared to be incomplete and “likely do not reflect the full proceedings.”

“The court is finding that the government’s actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct, are inextricably linked to the government’s grand jury presentation and deserve to be fully explored by the defense,” Judge Fitzpatrick wrote.

As part of his ruling, the judge ordered prosecutors to provide Mr. Comey’s lawyers by Monday evening with the same grand jury materials that he himself has already looked at — a measure he described as “an extraordinary remedy.” Typically, grand jury notes are kept secret before trial, even from defendants and their lawyers.

But the disclosure was needed, Judge Fitzpatrick said, to permit Mr. Comey’s legal team to delve into the question of whether Ms. Halligan and an F.B.I. agent who testified in front of the grand jury had conducted themselves properly when they secured the indictment.

The ruling by Judge Fitzpatrick was only the most recent setback in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring charges against Mr. Comey — a decision that was initially rejected by Ms. Halligan’s predecessor as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik S. Siebert. In an extraordinary move, Mr. Trump ousted Mr. Siebert in September to make way for Ms. Halligan after he suggested there was insufficient evidence to file an indictment against Mr. Comey.

Judge Fitzpatrick’s harsh words came just days after a different judge involved in the Comey case raised doubts about a separate question pertaining to Ms. Halligan: namely, whether Attorney General Pam Bondi had lawfully appointed her to her post as U.S. attorney in the first place. The judge overseeing that issue said she would make a decision on the matter by Thanksgiving.

The indictment against Mr. Comey charges him with lying to and obstructing Congress during an appearance he made in September 2020 in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee. At the hearing, he was asked questions about whether he had authorized anyone at the F.B.I. to serve as an anonymous source in newspaper articles about sensitive investigations.

Ms. Halligan, who had never worked on a criminal case until she was thrust into the Comey prosecution, has faced extensive scrutiny from the moment Mr. Trump installed her atop the U.S. attorney’s office in the Eastern District of Virginia against the wishes of many career prosecutors there. Her critics have pointed out that her previous experience in the law was limited to working as an insurance lawyer and serving as a personal lawyer to Mr. Trump.

It is extremely unusual for judges to examine how prosecutors act in front of grand juries, let alone to openly criticize their conduct. But that is exactly what Judge Fitzpatrick did to Ms. Halligan.

He noted that during her grand jury presentation she appears to have misrepresented a basic tenet of the law by suggesting that Mr. Comey did not have the right, under the Fifth Amendment, to avoid testifying at his own trial.

She also appears to have made another astonishing error, Judge Fitzpatrick said. In his ruling, he pointed out that she told grand jurors that they did not have to rely solely “on the record before them” to return an indictment against Mr. Comey, but instead “could be assured the government had more evidence — perhaps better evidence — that would be presented at trial.”

The judge also said that Ms. Halligan appears to have botched her efforts to pare down the three-count indictment she had initially sought against Mr. Comey after grand jurors rejected one of the charges. Moreover, he noted that the grand jury transcripts he later received from her did not appear to contain her presentation of the second, two-charge indictment to the grand jury, leaving the record incomplete.

If, however, a second presentation was never made, then the court “is in uncharted legal territory,” he went on.

That would suggest, he wrote, “that the indictment returned in open court was not the same charging document presented to and deliberated upon by the grand jury.”

“Either way,” the judge concluded, “this unusual series of events, still not fully explained by the prosecutor’s declaration, calls into question the presumption of regularity generally associated with grand jury proceedings, and provides another genuine issue the defense may raise to challenge the manner in which the government obtained the indictment.”

Judge Fitzpatrick mentioned one more potential problem with the government’s grand jury presentation. He questioned whether the F.B.I. agent who was the sole witness to have testified may have inadvertently disclosed information that should not have been revealed because of the attorney-client privilege.

Ultimately, the decision about whether to dismiss the case based on these purported grand jury errors will lie with Judge Michael S. Nachmanoff, the district court judge who is handling the case. Judge Nachmanoff has already scheduled a hearing for early December to consider separate but related claims by Mr. Comey’s lawyers that Ms. Halligan had abused the grand jury process.

Now, as he prepares to return to the White House on Tuesday after a long absence, the prince may feel he has little to prove, despite all those years when he was effectively unwelcome in Washington. At 40 years old, he has cemented his power not only as the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia but as a global political heavyweight — a diplomatic deal-maker who oversees one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds.

Over the past few years, he has become too powerful for American politicians and chief executives to ignore.

On Tuesday, the face that will greet him could hardly be more welcoming. President Trump has repeatedly proven himself a warm friend of Saudi Arabia, a country where Mr. Trump’s family has cultivated significant business interests.

“This is a personal triumph for the crown prince,” said Gregory Gause, a scholar of Saudi Arabia and professor emeritus of international affairs at Texas A&M University. “Five years ago, if he had showed up in Washington, nobody would have talked to him. He’s coming back with a huge delegation as a regional leader, a world figure.”

The opprobrium that erupted after Mr. Khashoggi’s killing dogged Prince Mohammed for years until he put it behind him. The prince denied prior knowledge of the killing, but a U.S. intelligence assessment determined he had probably ordered it.

A lawsuit against him over the killing was dismissed by a U.S. federal court in 2022, after the State Department determined that the prince had immunity as a head of state. Even President Joseph R. Biden Jr. — who had pledged on the campaign trail in 2019 to turn Saudi Arabia into a pariah state — flew to the kingdom to meet the prince in 2022, when he needed his help to lower global oil prices.

In May, Mr. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the destination for his first major trip abroad of his second term as president.

“Over the past eight years, Saudi Arabia has proved the critics totally wrong,” Mr. Trump declared during the visit.

During the same visit, Mr. Trump toured a Saudi government-owned real estate project called Diriyah. The Trump Organization is in talks that could bring a Trump-branded property to Diriyah, the project’s chief executive told The Times — the latest example of the Trump family’s fluid mingling of politics with profit.

The crown prince has overseen a significant loosening of religious restrictions in the kingdom over the past decade, allowing greater social freedoms, while increasing political repression at the same time.

Today, the prince’s main focus is no longer on consolidating power, but rather on overhauling the kingdom’s economy. The deadline for his “Vision 2030” program to reduce dependence on oil is looming, even while financial constraints are mounting.

“Since the last visit, Saudi policy has become laser-focused on domestic economic priorities,” said Yasmine Farouk, Arabian Peninsula project director at the International Crisis Group.

He is expected to stick to business on this trip, including bilateral diplomatic and corporate deals. His priorities include signing a mutual defense agreement with the United States, advancing a potential deal to transfer American nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and sealing agreements for the two countries to collaborate in the field of artificial intelligence, according to analysts.

Mr. Trump, in turn, is eager to persuade the prince to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. But that is “pretty much off the table,” said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.

“Saudi Arabia can’t go forward with normalization without Israel in effect recognizing the Palestinians have the right to a state,” he said.

The Trump administration and Saudi Arabia have also been trying to work out an agreement in which U.S. weapons manufacturers would sell F-35 jets to Saudi Arabia, although an intelligence report raised concerns that China could acquire the technology if the sale went through.

Prince Mohammed has sought to build deeper ties with China and other world powers, too.

“We are always keen to strengthen our bilateral relationship with the United States, even though we have a lot of other options,” said Salman al-Ansari, a Saudi political analyst.

The visit comes as Saudi Arabia and other U.S. allies in the Middle East express increasing uncertainty over the strength of American security guarantees. In September, Israel tried to assassinate senior Hamas officials in Qatar, rattling neighboring Persian Gulf countries.

“The Saudis worry about U.S. reliability,” Mr. Gause said. “Part of the way to keep us from leaving is to have all these great deals that we’re going to see signed in Washington in the next few days.”

“We may be having some discussions with Maduro, and we’ll see how that turns out,” Mr. Trump said, speaking at an airport in West Palm Beach, Fla. He added that Venezuela “would like to talk” but would not elaborate on what he meant.

“What does it mean? You tell me, I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. When a reporter asked if he was interested in negotiations, he shrugged. “I talk to anybody,” he said. “I talk to you.”

The Trump administration has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean and reviewing options for potential strikes inside Venezuela, even as Mr. Trump’s aides provide conflicting accounts of what they are seeking to achieve.

It has also launched 21 known strikes on boats it claimed were trafficking narcotics in the waters off Central and South America, killing at least 83 people since September in a campaign that many legal experts say violates international law.

The Trump administration has said the campaign is about stopping the flow of drugs in the region, but has yet to provide evidence that any of these boats were moving drugs. And the discussion by Mr. Trump and his top aides has focused on removing Mr. Maduro from office. The United States and its allies do not recognize Mr. Maduro as the legitimate leader of Venezuela after last year’s election.

On Sunday, the U.S. Navy announced that the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford, the country’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier, had arrived in the Caribbean with its accompanying warships and attack planes. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had ordered its deployment to the region last month. Mr. Maduro has placed Venezuela’s military on high alert.

The carrier’s arrival adds to the U.S. military’s ability to conduct boat strikes or potential attacks on Venezuelan soil. The American force in the region has now reached 15,000 soldiers and sailors, the largest in decades.

Later on Sunday, the U.S. military announced the details of its latest strike in the eastern Pacific of a boat the Trump administration said was smuggling drugs by sea. The strike on Saturday killed three people.

In a social media post on Sunday, the U.S. Southern Command said that the boat was being operated by a “designated terrorist organization” and was trafficking narcotics in the eastern Pacific. It did not provide evidence for those claims. The post included a video that showed a boat being struck.

In another move to escalate the pressure campaign against Mr. Maduro, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday announced that the State Department would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization. The designation restricts financial transactions of the group or anyone associated with it.

Mr. Rubio said the group is “headed” by Mr. Maduro and high-ranking individuals in his government. A federal indictment from 2020 accuses Maduro of drug trafficking charges related to the group. He has denied the charges.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump, speaking of Mr. Carlson as he traveled back to the White House after spending the weekend golfing at Mar-a-Lago, said, “You can’t tell him who to interview.” The president then insisted that he “didn’t know much about” Mr. Fuentes, whom he previously dined with at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, an episode that also caused a furor.

If Mr. Carlson wanted to interview Mr. Fuentes, then “get the word out,” Mr. Trump said. “People have to decide. Ultimately people have to decide.”

Mr. Fuentes, who had previously bragged that the silence from the White House over the episode was a sign of his growing influence on the right, shared Mr. Trump’s defense of Mr. Carlson on social media, writing “Thank you Mr. President!”

Mr. Trump’s defense of Mr. Carlson did not address Mr. Fuentes’s racist views, or Mr. Carlson’s expressions of sympathy for some of his positions. But the president’s remarks threw the right-wing influencer a lifeline weeks after prominent Republican lawmakers, Jewish organizations and conservative influencers denounced him for the podcast.

Even as many figures on the right disavowed or distanced themselves from Mr. Carlson, others defended him. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, a powerful think tank at the center of conservative politics, said that Mr. Carlson’s critics were “sowing division” and that he would “always be a close friend” to the institution. (Days later, in response to significant criticism over those remarks, Mr. Roberts pleaded ignorance, saying that he “didn’t know much about this Fuentes guy.” His video defending Mr. Carlson has not been retracted.)

The White House stayed out of the uproar for weeks. Mr. Fuentes, appearing on his own podcast soon after speaking to Mr. Carlson, interpreted that silence as a victory for his movement of so-called groypers, who oppose diversity and immigration and believe the United States was better off when Christian white men were in charge.

Mr. Fuentes gleefully singled out Vice President JD Vance for not condemning him. Mr. Fuentes has long been a mocking critic of Mr. Vance and has made racist remarks about his wife, Usha.

Hours before Mr. Trump’s comments on Sunday, Mr. Vance waded into the infighting among conservatives to defend Mr. Carlson’s son Buckley, who works as an aide in the vice president’s office. After a conservative political operative had attacked the younger Carlson on social media, accusing him of bigotry because of his connection to his father, Mr. Vance lashed back.

“I have an extraordinary tolerance for disagreements and criticisms from the various people in our coalition,” Mr. Vance said in a social media post. “But I am a very loyal person, and I have zero tolerance for scumbags attacking my staff.”

“It’s time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat ‘Shutdown,’” he wrote.

The president’s turnabout followed his intensive pressure campaign over the Epstein files that often appeared to overshadow efforts on other matters, including the recent government shutdown. In a last-ditch effort in recent days, Mr. Trump reached out personally to try to sway Republican lawmakers backing the measure, summoning one to a meeting in the White House Situation Room with his attorney general and F.B.I. director to discuss the demand to release the files.

It was unclear how quickly Mr. Trump’s tightly controlled Justice Department might release files on Mr. Epstein, or whether the president’s seeming backing of the idea might speed such a release, regardless of the vote. When he ordered the department to look into Democrats associated with Mr. Epstein last week, his own ties to the disgraced financier were receiving renewed scrutiny because of the release of a trove of emails in which Mr. Epstein claimed Mr. Trump knew of his activities.

Even if the bill were to pass the House, it would face longer odds in the Senate, where 60 votes would be needed to bring up the bill. Democrats hold 47 seats, so even if all of them back the measure, they would still need 13 Republicans to join them.

The Republican base remains split over the files, and the tension has led to a falling-out between Mr. Trump and one of his closest political allies, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia.

On Sunday, minutes after Mr. Trump publicly reversed course on the Epstein files, he said on social media that Ms. Greene “is working overtime to try and portray herself as a victim when, in actuality, she is the cause of all of her own problems.” Mr. Trump has escalated his attacks on Ms. Greene in the past week, calling her a “traitor,” something that she says has led to death threats.

Ms. Greene is far from the only Republican lawmaker pushing to release the files.

Hours before Mr. Trump’s announcement on Sunday evening, Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who has helped lead efforts in Congress to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, suggested on ABC’s “This Week” that “100 or more” House Republicans could support such a measure this week despite opposition from the president. “The record of this vote will last longer than Donald Trump’s presidency,” he said.

Speaker Mike Johnson also predicted significant G.O.P. support, acknowledging before Mr. Trump’s reversal on Sunday that there would be “lots of votes” for the bill. Mr. Johnson, who said last week that he would move up the timeline for a vote on the bill to this week, told “Fox News Sunday” that the House just needed to “get this done and move it on.”

“There’s nothing to hide,” he added.

On Wednesday, lawmakers released more than 20,000 emails belonging to Mr. Epstein in which the convicted sex offender claimed that the president once “spent hours at my house” with a young woman who later accused Mr. Epstein of sexually abusing and trafficking her when she was a teenager.

The document dump fueled the drama over Mr. Epstein that has engulfed Mr. Trump, Mr. Johnson and his Republican majority. Mr. Trump dismissed the emails as a “hoax” to drive attention away from the government shutdown, which he blamed on Democrats. But pressure instead built on Mr. Johnson, who relented in moving up the vote.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/17/multimedia/17trump-news-promo3p-fltz/17trump-news-promo3p-fltz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:04.188257

In response, attorneys for the asylum seekers and Al Otro Lado, the organization serving them, shared the following comment:

“The issue before the Court is whether noncitizens seeking safety at ports of entry along the U.S. southern border have a legal right to apply for asylum in the United States. As the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded, our immigration laws require the government to inspect and process people seeking asylum at ports of entry and allow them to pursue their legal claims in the United States. The government’s turnback policy was an illegal scheme to circumvent these requirements by physically blocking asylum seekers arriving at ports of entry and preventing them from crossing the border to seek protection. Vulnerable families, children, and adults fleeing persecution were stranded in perilous conditions where they faced violent assault, kidnapping, and death. We look forward to presenting our case to the Court.”

She will give an oral statement in the House of Commons this evening and answer questions from MPs.

Let me say from the outset to those who are worried that we do not have any timescales for implementation or details of who will be affected (e.g. people who are currently waiting for a decision). Where it is indicated that changes will be consulted on or legislation will be brought forward, that obviously means that we will have a bit more notice before anything is implemented.

There are two forewords to the paper, from the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary. With no indication that she feels any sense of ownership for the situation, the Home Secretary states that “Over 100,000 people now live in asylum accommodation, funded by the taxpayer. Many refugees remain unemployed several years after being granted protection, depending on taxpayer funded benefits to live in the UK.” This is of course a result of slow and inaccurate processing of claims as well as a ban on work for those waiting in the asylum system for so long, which makes it more difficult for them to get their lives up and running again following a grant of status.

She states “In 2024, asylum claims in the UK rose by 18 percent, to a record high. Across Europe, meanwhile, claims fell by 13 percent.” Yet fails to mention that Germany (218,550) receives twice as many applications as the UK (109,343) which is in fifth place in Europe, also behind Spain (164,830), France (159,260) and Italy (151,525).

The paper is in three sections. Part I: Reducing arrivals, Part II: Increasing removals, and Part III: Safe and legal routes. I have looked at the details below.

Part I: Reducing arrivals

This section begins with an assertion that various factors are acting as “pull factors” for people to come to the UK. These include “the generosity of refugee protection in the UK”, “the extent of support provided” to those waiting for a decision and the ability to work without permission to do so.

Notably and predictably, there is no reference to the Home Office’s own research showing that “welfare policies and labour market access have little impact on migrant decision making”, or indeed, to any evidence at all. There are several proposals to address this.

Extension of period needed to reach settlement from five to twenty years and “safe return” reviews every two and a half years

By way of quick background, before 30 August 2005, settlement was granted to people when their asylum claim succeeded. On 30 August 2005 this was changed to an initial grant of five years, after which the person could apply for settlement. A “safe return review” whereby the Home Office would consider whether a person could return to their country of origin at the end of the five years instead of being granted settlement was announced in 2017 but not much seems to have come of this.

Then there was the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 which introduced the “two tier” system of refugee status whereby certain refugees (those deemed to have entered “illegally”) were granted two and a half years’ leave to remain. They would be eligible for settlement only under the normal long residence rules and after holding leave for ten years. Robert Jenrick MP closed this process in June 2023.

In the new policy paper, reference is made to the asylum system in Denmark throughout. It mentions that settlement can be obtained there after eight years of residence, subject to various requirements being met. The Home Office’s proposal is for there to be no path to settlement in a protection route until a person has spent twenty years in the UK. No explanation is provided as to why even Denmark’s eight year waiting period has been deemed too generous. This twenty year route is referred to as the “core protection” route.

Instead of five years, refugees will be granted leave for two and a half years and will have to keep renewing this. Each time the Home Office will only grant the extension if they accept that there is still a need for protection. If it is decided that there is no longer such a need, the intention will be to remove that person. So the plan is that people will spend twenty years of their lives here living in terror of being sent back to a country where the UK has accepted that they have previously been at risk of persecution in.

These short periods of leave and inevitably lengthy periods spent with section 3C leave will make it difficult for people to work and find homes, as we have already seen happening with Ukrainians. It will also be enormously damaging to people’s mental health. Inevitably, more people will need support from the state.

If eligible, people will be able to switch into a new “protection work and study route”. This will be available to people who “obtain employment or commence study at an appropriate level and pay a fee. Once on this route, they will become eligible to ‘earn’ settlement sooner than they would under core protection alone”.

Family reunion

It seems that the intention is that family reunion will only be available to those who have moved into the work and study route. Under core protection we are told that there will be “no automatic right to family reunion”. It will still exist, but “stricter requirements will apply”. Those in the work and study routes may be subject to the same requirements to bring dependants as in other routes, presumably such as Appendix FM.

Public funds

They have also trailed changes to benefits for refugees, stating that:

we are now exploring a change to taxpayer-funded benefits to prioritise access for those who are making an economic contribution to the UK. This could see additional criteria that migrants have to meet to receive benefits and actions they need to take in order not to lose them. A consultation on this question will take place in 2026.

Asylum support

The government will be revoking The Asylum Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005 and the paper states that they “will restore a discretionary power to offer support”. It is unclear to me how much will actually change here. Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1995 already says that the Home Secretary may provide support to people who appear “to be destitute or to be likely to become destitute”.

Even without these laws in place, people cannot simply be left without support where that would make them destitute. The “law of humanity” will still apply under the common law.

The paper goes on to say:

In doing so, we will deny support to those who have the right to work and could therefore support themselves. This would include those who enter the country on a work or student visa with permission to work before claiming asylum, or those granted permission to work where their claim has been outstanding for more than 12 months.

It is obviously much more difficult for people in that first group (with section 3C leave) to find work because employers do not know how long they will have that leave for, as it will only last until either their asylum claim is granted or once they are appeals rights exhausted.

People without leave who have claimed asylum are able to work only after they have been waiting for a decision on their claim for over 12 months and they have applied to the Home Office for permission to work and that request has been granted. Even then, they are only allowed to work in an extremely limited number of roles.

The Home Office cannot have it both ways and make it incredibly difficult for people to work and then withhold support from them if they are unable to do so.

The paper also says that support will be removed from those who “fail to abide by a removal direction”, work illegally, refuse to relocate to a different accommodation site or are disruptive in accommodation.

Removal of assets (aka “contributions mechanism”)

This proposal states that:

we will require individuals to contribute towards the cost of their asylum support where they have some assets or income, but not enough to support themselves independently. We will also take action to recover support costs in scenarios where any assets are not convertible into cash or declared at the point that asylum support is initially provided but become convertible or are discovered at a later date.

This wording looks fairly identical to section 31 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which provides for a “financial contribution by resident” of an accommodation centre. This section has not been brought into force but includes provision for the Home Secretary to make regulations to recover costs relating to accommodation and other facilities where the person has assets that can be converted into cash.

The Lords debate on removing that clause when it was still a bill is worth revisiting. Section 31 only covers accommodation centres, so the government’s proposal would presumably be to extend this to all types of support.

Large scale accommodation sites

This has already been announced and there are no new details here.

Illegal working

Again, nothing new here. Just mention of previously announced changes on expansion of right to work checks and the digital hostile environment.

Part II: Increasing removals

The paper says that the UK/France pilot will be continued, but with a “higher appetite” for removing people, apparently. It also says that removals to certain countries will be resumed and say that they have already started returning a small number of Syrians.

It refers to several European countries beginning “voluntary removals”, so presumably at this stage the UK has also just been helping those who wish to return. The paper goes on to say that they are “exploring resuming enforced returns” to certain countries, including to Syria.

Removing failed asylum seekers

The paper says that the UK/France pilot will be continued, but with a “higher appetite” for removing people, apparently. It also says that removals to certain countries will be resumed and say that they have already started returning a small number of Syrians.

It refers to several European countries beginning “voluntary removals”, so presumably at this stage the UK has also just been helping those who wish to return. The paper goes on to say that they are “exploring resuming enforced returns” to certain countries, including to Syria.

A consultation is to be launched on the enforced removal of families with children. This consultation will also include “commencing measures in the 2016 Immigration Act which will allow us to remove support from families who do not have a genuine obstacle to leaving the country”. Taking a quick look, this seems to mean sections 66 and 68 and schedules 11 and 12 of the Immigration Act 2016.

Visa penalties

This proposal formed part of the Conservative government’s New Plan for Immigration, eventually making its way into section 72 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 which provides for “visa penalties for uncooperative countries”. I don’t think it has ever actually been used, presumably because there are non-Home Office related reasons which make it sensible to maintain good relations with other countries.

Appeals reform

Yet again there are some fairly glaring omissions in the Home Office’s assessment of the situation regarding the appeals backlog. For a proper picture of what is going on, see my explanation.

The paper mentions increased judicial sitting days and statutory timelines, neither of which are new announcements. A new appeals body has also already been announced, although one welcome point to note here is the mention that “Early legal advice will be a core part of system reforms, avoiding delays and late claims, leading to better decisions”. Again, this needs to be present at application stage as well, so that many cases can avoid being wrongly refused in the first place, but any mention of the importance of legal advice is a positive.

There is also mention of accelerating certain cases, again this is a process that already exists in detained cases. They also mention “strengthening” the approach to certifying cases to remove the right of appeal. It is unclear whether anything new is being proposed here beyond further use of existing processes.

What is new is proposed legislation for accelerated appeals in “removable high-harm cases, foreign national offenders, and others who are detained and readily removable”, but no more detail than this is provided.

Legislation is also proposed “to enable an expedited appeal for first time late claims where someone is being removed but has not previously made a claim. This will ensure these claims do not suspend removal, as is all too often the case today”. I have addressed this situation previously, the system often operates to prevent people from being able to make these claims earlier.

Legislation is also to be made to ensure that a person does not accrue any private or family life rights if they do not leave the UK after an unsuccessful claim. This will presumably involve an amendment to section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as trailed in the immigration white paper in May).

Fresh claims will seemingly require a paid application, this is a bit unclear but seems to be saying where the fresh claim is based on article 8. It is unclear what the process would be if e.g. it was a sur place claim (where the need for asylum only arose later on because of a change of circumstances in the country of origin). This change will be made via the immigration rules.

Legal reform

As set out in the immigration white paper earlier this year, the government is unhappy with the number of families of British citizens and those who are settled here who are unable to meet the minimum income requirement, yet have the audacity to still want to live together.

The paper also mentions that 86% of people who raised rights based applications in detention awaiting removal were released. A significant factor in this which goes unmentioned will of course be the decimation of legal aid advice generally, but particularly the removal of article 8 cases from the scope of legal aid, meaning that people are unable to access their rights at an earlier stage.

In response to the above two “problems”. Again, several changes are proposed.

The first is to:

legislate to set out to Home Office decision makers, and the courts, how to properly balance the public interest against individual rights. This intends to narrow the circumstances in which an individual’s Article 8 rights would outweigh the public interest in removing them.

The second is to set out in primary legislation a more narrow definition of family, largely restricted to immediate family members, with limited exceptions. The second is to change the application process for leave outside the rules applications based on article 8. Applications to bring people from outside the UK will need to be submitted by the UK based family member.

For in-country applications:

we will prescribe how and when Article 8 claims can be made. This will prevent migrants from frustrating removal by making late human rights claims, avoiding fees and relying on the courts to remake Home Office decisions, or in some cases having the courts consider Article 8 claims that have not even been considered by the Home Office.

This doesn’t make much sense to me and I can’t really see a change in here.

The third proposed change is to work with other countries to limit the definition of “inhuman or degrading treatment” in article 3 claims.

Next, reform to the modern slavery system (which is very much not being abused). Here the paper mentions the guidance change on reconsiderations made in September. It also talks about improved screening processes, with no acknowledgement of the well known fact (contained in the Home Office’s own guidance) that survivors of modern slavery often have difficulty in disclosing their experiences. New legislation is mentioned, without any further detail.

Other barriers to removal

Here, we are told that the immigration rules will be changed to allow consideration and refusal of protection claims after the screening interview. It is unclear whether any form of longer screening interview will take place in these circumstances.

The paper states that this process will be used to “target citizens of manifestly safe countries”. I will raise my usual concerns here that generally when countries are deemed “safe”, the safety of LGBTQI+ people is not considered. This will be one to keep an eye on.

Apparently processes and systems will be improved to ensure that they do not miss opportunities to deport foreign national offenders waiting for trial on other more minor offences.

The use of AI in age assessments was announced back in July 2025 but is repeated here. Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit published a good response at the time.

There is already evidence of racial bias in AI. In Australia, there is evidence of this specifically in using AI to carry out age assessments (in the context of their social media ban for children, rather than for asylum). The trial was carried out by a UK based company and found that racial bias in the system meant that the tests were less accurate for certain groups.

Part III: Safe and legal routes

Unsurprisingly, this is the smallest section of the paper. Let me be clear from the outset, because I have already seen this argument being made a couple of times. There is no trade off which would make the above proposals for refugees in any way more acceptable. There are no circumstances in which it is okay to treat people like that, to forcibly separate families and to keep people living in limbo for decades. And what is on offer here is thin gruel indeed.

Let’s also remember that the context for this is that the past couple of years has seen the closure of “safe and legal routes”, namely the Ukraine, Afghan and family reunion schemes with little if any advance notice. The latter two closures have taken place under this government. Other routes still exist but seem to have stalled through government inaction on quotas.

All that the paper says is that:

To achieve this, we will:

reform refugee sponsorship to give voluntary and community sector organisations a greater role in resettlement through named sponsorship, within caps set by government

introduce a capped route for refugee and displaced students to study in the UK, helping talented refugees to continue their studies, realise their potential and be able to return to their country and help rebuild it as soon as circumstances allow

establish a capped route for skilled refugees and displaced people to come to the UK for work, building on the experience of the Displaced Talent Mobility Pilot

It is proposed that those arriving through these routes will have to wait ten years before they can settle, this will be subject to consultation. It is unclear whether they will also have to renew their leave every two and a half years and live under the threat of removal during that decade.

Conclusion

A bullet point summary of the proposals is available as an appendix to the paper. As I said at the outset, it is unclear what will happen when. Where it has been indicated that changes will be made to the immigration rules, this can potentially happen sooner that those subject to consultation and changes to primary legislation.

This is a shameful day for Labour. These proposals are cruel, unnecessary and perhaps most importantly for the two authors of the foreword, will have no impact on the desperate people who continue to make that dangerous journey across the Channel.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/facebook-Linked_Image___1948421727_11c577fdef_3k-min-edited-600x337.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:14.390765

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda.
It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens).
There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said.
Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration.","Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.

The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.

But the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.

Forty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.

Asked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.

ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.

“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”

About 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.

The poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Concerns with Trump, Republicans

Latino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office.

There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.

The vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.

“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.

“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”

Evans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.

‘Latinos are looking for leadership’

Still, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.

Fifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)

“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”

He added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”

Despite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.

Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.

That’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.

With next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.

“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem. It can affect your impressions of President Trump,” Chen said. “But when it comes to how (Latinos) are going to vote, (they’re) going to vote on the thing that’s really affected me, which is the economy.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-immigrant-rights-RJS-13431.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:08.249902

Refugee and migrant rights are women’s rights.","Today (17th November 2025), the government has announced plans to rollback rights and protections for refugees and people seeking safety in the UK.

In a joint statement, Southall Black Sisters Hibiscus, End Violence Against Women Coalition and Latin American Women’s Rights Service responded to these plans.

We are outraged by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood’s announcement today introducing a sweeping roll-back of the rights of asylum-seekers and refugees seeking safety in the UK. These measures, described by the Home Secretary as ‘the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times’, will have devastating and life-threatening consequences for women and children, particularly those trapped in cycles of abuse. They will further restrict women’s already limited ability to escape violence and exploitation.

These policies disregard the daily realities we as specialist ending violence against women and girls organisations witness firsthand on the frontline. We see, with painful clarity, that insecure immigration status is one of the strongest predictors of continued abuse, exploitation, and homelessness. When the state strips away human-rights protections, restricts family-life claims, renders refugees’ settlement temporary, and closes off safe routes to safety, the consequences fall most brutally on women and children who are already marginalised and least able to defend themselves.

The hostile environment, now intensified by these regressive reforms, is fuelling an already-burning fire. Women who have fled violence must now navigate not only abuse and precarity but also an increasingly punitive and unsafe public climate. Against this backdrop, the government’s reshaping of the immigration framework, including the erosion of Article 8 protections enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights, the removal of the statutory duty to support people seeking asylum, and the creation of ‘talent-based’ routes to safety, rings alarm bells for migrant victim-survivors and their children. These proposals should alarm anyone with any stake in women’s rights and human rights.

Refugee and migrant rights are women’s rights. We stand united in condemning these reforms and call on the government to immediately reverse course and adopt a genuine human-rights based approach to overhauling the UK’s immigration and asylum systems.",https://www.endviolenceagainstwomen.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Refugee-and-migrant-rights-are-womens-rights.-1400-x-1434-px.png,N,,2025-11-17 14:58:22.296762

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files.
“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.
For years, Trump’s Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful.
“Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday.","Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to back the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files, an abrupt reversal, is a rare instance of the president being unable to tame his Maga base and being instead forced to accede to it.

Many Republicans are expected to support a vote in the US House this week to force the justice department to release the files. Once the measure passes, it would still need approval in the US Senate, where 13 Republican senators would need to join with all 47 Democrats to approve it.

Trump spent last week aggressively squeezing allies in the US House, including Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, to back off in their support of releasing the files. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and when it became apparent the measure was going to pass, Trump backed it in an effort to salvage an embarrassing political loss. “House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,” he posted on his Truth Social network on Sunday evening.

For years, Trump’s Maga base, including people who now have prominent positions in his administration, have called for the release of the Epstein files, suggesting there was a conspiracy to protect the rich and powerful. Trump supported the release as a candidate. But earlier this year, the justice department said it had reviewed the files and would not be releasing more documents. That set off more furor and pressure on Trump to release them.

The House oversight committee last week released a tranche of documents they obtained from Epstein’s estate, including messages in which Epstein wrote that Trump knew of Epstein’s conduct. The messages also show Trump ally Steve Bannon advising Epstein on how to rehabilitate his image. Epstein further corresponded with other prominent people, including the former treasury secretary and Harvard president Larry Summers; the journalist Michael Wolff; and Kathryn Ruemmler, Barack Obama’s former White House counsel.

The release of those messages has only further increased scrutiny on Trump, and built the pressure to release everything the government still has on Epstein – which could be quite a lot, given the number of federal investigations conducted into him.

Some Maga influencers have sought to pivot the story away from Trump. Megyn Kelly, the conservative radio host, appeared to question whether Epstein really was a pedophile. “There’s a difference between a 15-year-old and a five-year-old,” she said on her podcast. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to one count of soliciting an underage prostitute and in 2019 faced federal sex trafficking charges for girls as young as 14. Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.

The issue has ignited a bitter split with Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House representative of Georgia, who has increasingly styled herself as someone in touch with the real Maga base and has refused to blindly back Trump through the Epstein saga. “Releasing the Epstein files is the easiest thing in the world,” she told Politico on Friday. “Just release it all, let the American people sort through every bit of it, and, you know, support the victims. That’s just like the most common sense, easiest thing in the world. But to spend any effort trying to stop it makes – it just doesn’t make sense to me.”

Trump repeatedly attacked Greene over the weekend, calling her a “traitor”, amid other insults. Greene decried the president’s rhetoric during an interview on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday. “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” she said.

Later that evening she posted on social media that she and her family had started receiving hoax pizza deliveries, and that there had been a pipe bomb threat directed at her construction company. Pressed on CNN about why she was speaking out against the president’s rhetoric now, as she had not condemned his similarly viscous rhetoric in the past, she was evasive.

“I’m only responsible for myself and my own words and actions … and I’ve been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics,” she said. “I really want to just see people be kind to one another.” She also stressed during the interview that she continued to support the president and his administration.

But whether Trump’s reversal will effectively quell the pressure from his base, or if he will continue to feel the heat – including from some of his otherwise staunchest allies – will be closely watched.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8667e758ebab167407a2be7c707c2d7a8eea33d8/1517_310_4872_3897/master/4872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d07b473e69c0f29e23ea85b18507709e",N,,2025-11-17 13:57:23.160976

Seven detainees at an immigration detention center in California City have sued U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging the facility is polluted by sewage leaks, infested with bugs and is denying people access to food, water and their lawyers.

The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California also claims detainees do not have appropriate clothing for the chilly desert nights, nor appropriate medical attention for life-threatening conditions. The lawsuit alleges detainees with mobility issues don’t have access to wheelchairs, and in some cases are unable to bathe or dress themselves.

The plaintiffs are seeking to make the lawsuit a class action on behalf of all detainees housed at the California City Immigration Processing Center, which is about 75 miles east of Bakersfield and run by the private prison company CoreCivic.

“In their haste to warehouse hundreds of men and women in this isolated facility, defendants have failed to provide for the basic human needs of the people for whose lives and wellbeing they are legally responsible,” the lawsuit alleges.

ICE opened the immigration detention center at the site of a closed prison and began admitting detainees in August. On average, there were about 480 people held in the detention center each day in September, and the facility has the capability to house up to 2,560 people. The lawsuit asserts 800 people are now housed there.

A spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on the lawsuit for this story.

In September, a state disability rights group conducted a two-day inspection of the facility and found that its operators failed to distribute medication for life-threatening conditions and did not schedule timely surgeries for people that needed them.

CalMatters reported on conditions at the detention center last month. Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, in a written statement at the time said the site provides robust medical care. He said those services adhere to “standards set forth by our government partners.”

The detention center’s accelerated opening was part of the Trump administration’s plan to execute the largest deportation program in U.S. history. California City’s mayor previously told CalMatters the federal government opened the facility without proper permits or a business license as required by state law.

“In the rush to expand capacity, ICE has cobbled together a patchwork system of county jails, private prisons, and newly converted facilities across the country. The rapid and haphazard growth of the detention system has outstripped any meaningful system of accountability or oversight,” the lawsuit alleges.

The lawsuit was filed by Prison Law Office, a nonprofit organization that focuses on conditions in California prisons; along with the American Civil Liberties Union, the advocacy group California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice and the law firm Keker Van Nest & Peters LLP.

Conditions in immigration detention facilities have long been the subject of complaints and lawsuits. Counties in California have the option to inspect immigration detention facilities, although few do. Three of the four counties in California that host the facilities have not held inspections.

Seventeen people have died in ICE facilities this year, two in California. The agency’s official list of deaths in custody documents 15. Two subsequent deaths — one each in California and New York have not yet been added to the ICE list.

One plaintiff in the lawsuit, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, alleged that he has been denied medication for a heart condition for days at a time. The lawsuit alleges the lack of medication led to him being hospitalized twice.

“During the last hospitalization, a doctor told Mr. Roque Campos that he could die if this were to happen again,” the lawsuit alleges. “Mr. Roque Campos has yet to see a cardiologist and still does not consistently receive his medication.”",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bae653f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F4f%2F36efe1f64c54a9b9873f68e7e1b4%2Fcalcity-detention-mv-cm-12.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:18.171450

Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Mahmood said undocumented migration is “tearing the country apart”.

end of list

The government’s proposals, to be unveiled on Monday, will have two main prongs. First, they would end the automatic path to settled status for refugees after five years. And second, they would remove state benefits from those who have the right to work and can support themselves.

After a summer of fierce protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers and an anti-immigration march in London, Mahmood also announced new plans to curb small-boat crossings from France as well as to return refugees to their home countries once it is safe to do so.

What are the current immigration numbers?

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that net migration – the number of people entering a country minus the number leaving – had hovered around 200,000 to 300,000 people per year since 2011.

However, after Brexit was enacted in 2020, there was a large increase in the number of undocumented immigrants entering the UK. Data from the ONS showed net migration climbed to 906,000 for the 12 months to June 2023.

But more recent figures showed those numbers have fallen dramatically since then. Net migration figures dropped by more than half in 2024 – to 431,000. This was largely owing to a decrease in the number of healthcare and student visas made available last year.

Meanwhile, despite a UK media focus on people arriving in small boats from France, this group makes up a small share of the overall number of people entering the country. In 2024, for instance, the Home Office found that 36,816 people who arrived in the UK came via small boats.

In total, 108,138 people claimed asylum last year. Of those, only one-third came via small boats. As such, most claims for asylum went through formal channels (and included some dependants of those people).

Despite the falling numbers, disquiet with the ruling Labour Party remains rife. In an August YouGov poll, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Reform UK, an anti-immigration party, would be more effective at handling asylum cases than Labour, who secured just 9 percent of the tally.

What changes is the government announcing?

Access to citizenship

On Monday, the government is expected to announce a shift from permanent settlement for refugees to a temporary-protection model.

Current rules stipulate that refugees granted asylum may remain in the UK for five years before being able to apply for an “indefinite leave to remain”, opening the door to citizenship.

But under the new plans, those who enter the UK through the asylum process could face up to 20 years before seeking permanent residency.

In addition, people granted asylum would have to renew their status every 30 months to see if the situation in their home country has changed such that UK residence is still required.

Access to social benefits

Mahmood said she intends to repeal the legal duty of the government to provide accommodation and basic financial support to all asylum seekers.

The government is expected to withdraw support from asylum seekers deemed able to work as well as from those people who commit offences, ignore removal orders or work illegally.

Asylum seekers may currently apply for permission to work if their asylum claim has been outstanding for 12 months or more and if the delay is not considered their fault.

What do refugee rights groups say?

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity, said that instead of deterring migrants, the 20-year path to citizenship would “leave people in limbo and experiencing intense anxiety for many, many years”.

“We need a system that is controlled and is fair, and the way you do that is you make decisions fairly, in a timely fashion, and if someone is found to be a refugee, they go on and they contribute to our communities and they pay back,” he told the programme BBC Breakfast on Sunday.

Mahmood’s proposal for 30-month checks implies that refugees could be sent back to their home countries once the government believes conditions on the ground have improved – an approach inspired by Denmark’s much-debated policy.

Although research by the Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook has found that deterrence has limited influence on where asylum seekers travel to, a 2017 study did suggest that Denmark’s “negative branding” had led to fewer asylum applications.

How have others reacted to the proposals?

While Oxford University’s Migration Observatory said Mahmood’s overhaul would make the UK’s immigration system among the strictest countries in Europe, Matt Vickers, the opposition home office minister, said the government’s new plans to reform the asylum system contain “lots of gimmicks”.

He told the BBC that a “deterrent” is what is needed: “If people arrive in this country and know they’re going to get sent back, they won’t get in those boats in the first place.”

What other proposals is the UK government making?

Using artificial intelligence tools to assess age

The government wants to introduce artificial intelligence-based assessments to determine the age of people who arrive without documentation. Ministers said errors in the current system risk placing adults in children’s services or wrongly treating minors as adults.

Rights groups, however, warned that automated systems could entrench bias, wrongly classify children as adults and expose them to harm.

Earlier this year, Solomon told the BBC that he was “not convinced” that using AI tools was the government’s correct approach on age identification because he has concerns about children being put in unsafe situations. He added that “these [AI] technologies continue to raise serious questions about accuracy, ethics and fairness.”

Visa ban threat for three African countries

The Home Office has said visa applications from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo will be refused unless their governments improve collaboration with the UK regarding the deportation of their nationals.

In a statement, the department cited “unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive return procedures” as the reason for the potential penalty.

It said restrictions would apply “unless they agree to accept the return of their criminals and irregular migrants”.

Right to ‘family life’ claims to be checked

UK media are also reporting the government is set to limit how UK courts interpret the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in matters related to family life.

Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to a family and private life, will be reinterpreted “to better reflect the expectations of the British public”, the government is expected to say.

The new law would likely clarify that a “family connection” refers to immediate relatives only, such as a parent or child, and not to extended family members.

How will Ukrainian refugees be affected?

Asked about Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion, Mahmood said they would continue to be admitted on a “bespoke scheme” but would also be expected to return once the war ends. She stressed that many arrivals from Ukraine have expressed a desire to return home.

Under the current scheme, Ukrainian refugees have the right to live in the UK for up to three years with access to healthcare, education and benefits. As these visas are temporary, Ukrainian nationals are largely exempt from the new 20‑year settlement rules for asylum seekers.

Will there be new authorised pathways for asylum seekers to come to the UK?

Apart from Ukrainians, vulnerable people from Afghanistan are provided with legal residence, access to work, education and healthcare through the UK’s Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme.

In addition, the British national overseas (BNO) visa allows Hong Kong BNO status holders and their dependents the right to live, work and study in the UK, providing a pathway to settlement and eventual citizenship.

Mahmood also told the BBC that new “safe and legal” avenues will be introduced to try to reduce the number of people attempting perilous crossings of the English Channel.

Organisations such as Amnesty International have repeatedly highlighted that restrictive policies and limited visa schemes leave many people with no option but to attempt illegal entry.

Amnesty has called on Westminster to expand legal avenues – such as resettlement schemes, family reunification and community sponsorship – to reduce people smuggling and fatalities.

One option would be to allow individuals and charities in the UK to sponsor refugees, echoing the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which endows local communities with housing responsibilities.

The aim of these schemes, which would be for a limited number of people, is to give local areas more control to improve support.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-11-15T224658Z_1844714237_RC2Q1HA5XEDE_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-POLITICS-MIGRATION-1763379409.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-11-17 13:57:39.157285

The Trump administration has deployed a sweeping crackdown on immigration, launching ICE raids across the country and removing legal barriers in order to make deportations faster. The study found that while Democrats were largely consistent in their opposition to these immigration policies, Republican sentiment varied more, especially by age, gender and ethnicity.

“At least some subset of Republicans are seeing that these immigration strategies are a step too far,” said G. Cristina Mora, a sociology professor and co-director of the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, which administered the poll. The polling data were collected from nearly 5,000 registered voters in mid-August. Just over 1,000 of those surveyed were registered Republicans.

Latino Republicans, with whom Trump made historic gains during the 2024 elections, showed the highest levels of disagreement with the party’s aggressive stance on immigration. Young people from 18 to 29 and moderate women in the Republican Party also more significantly diverged from Trump’s policies.

The majority of Republican respondents expressed approval of Trump’s immigration strategy overall. However, the study found respondents diverged more from Trump’s policies that ignore established legal processes, including due process, birthright citizenship and identification of federal agents.

“On these legalistic issues, this is where you see some of the bigger breaks,” Mora said.

Of those surveyed, 28% disapproved of the end of birthright citizenship, which Trump is pushing for, and 45% agreed that ICE agents should show clear identification. Four in 10 Republican respondents also support due process for detained immigrants.

Young people, who make up about 15% of the party in California, were on average also more likely to break from Trump’s policies than older Republicans.

The analysis also found that education level and region had almost no impact on respondents' beliefs on immigration.

Latinos and women were more likely to disagree with Trump on humanitarian issues than their demographic counterparts.

Nearly 60% of moderate Republican women disagree with deporting longtime undocumented immigrants, compared with 47% of moderate men. 45% of women believe ICE raids unfairly target Latino communities.

The political party was most split across racial lines when it came to immigration enforcement being expanded into hospitals and schools. Forty-four percent of Latinos disagreed with the practice, compared with 26% of white respondents, while 46% of Latino respondents disagreed with deporting immigrants who have resided in the country for a long time, compared with just 30% of their white counterparts.

Trump had gained a significant Latino vote that helped him win reelection last year. Democratic candidates, however, made gains with Latino voters in elections earlier this month, indicating a possible shift away from the GOP.

The data could indicate Latino Republicans “are somewhat disillusioned” by the Trump administration's handling of immigration, Mora said. “Latinos aren't just disagreeing on the issues that we think are about process and American legal fairness. They’re also disagreeing on just the idea that this is cruel.”

Mora said the deluge of tense and sometimes violent encounters posted online could have an impact on Republican opinion surrounding immigration. A plainclothes agent pointed his gun at a female driver in Santa Ana last week, and two shootings involving ICE agents took place in Southern California late last month.

“You now have several months of Latinos being able to log on to their social media and see every kind of video of Latinos being targeted with or without papers,” Mora said. “I have to believe that that is doing something to everybody, not just Latino Republicans or Latino Democrats.”

More from James Baratta

AT&T has raked in hundreds of millions of dollars from its contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) since the early 2000s. Last year, the company inked a ten-year contract worth $146 million to “provide mission-critical communications services that support the agency’s national security and emergency preparedness mission,” a press release explains. (Verizon did the same, though its contract with DHS was valued at $176 million.)

But DHS is a very different animal during Donald Trump’s second term, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) conducting an unprecedented campaign of mass detention and deportation. In August, ICE sole-sourced an $11 million contract to AT&T for data analytics and support services. The company also received a $14 million payout from CBP in April for network-related services. Critics say AT&T does not need these rather modest contracts to remain profitable. For the past several quarters, the company’s revenues have consistently hovered around $30 billion, and its annual revenues have yet to fall shy of $120 billion.

“AT&T is enabling and profiting off of the invasion and defunding of our city and state,” said Will Tanzman, executive director of the People’s Lobby, a Chicago-based community advocacy group. “I think a lot of Chicagoans wouldn’t want to be supporting that.”

The Trump administration has sustained its assault on Chicago over the city’s sanctuary policies, threatening to withhold federal funding and deploying 200 ICE officers as part of Operation Midway Blitz in September. As my colleague Emma Janssen reported, federal immigration authorities have terrorized residents of the Windy City, killing a man in a suburb and firing pepper balls at peaceful protesters; immigration attorneys have struggled to track down their clients; and now, Chicagoans have set their sights on AT&T for “enabling and supporting the level of civil liberties violations and human rights violations that ICE is engaging in,” Tanzman told the Prospect.

The People’s Lobby and ONE People’s Campaign—member organizations of People’s Action, a national network of community activists—recently introduced a petition demanding that AT&T drop its contracts with DHS. In a joint statement, organizers criticized the telecom giant for “choosing to both collect money from customers who are in the crosshairs, and line its pockets with public dollars from DHS and ICE, whose agents are masked, unidentifiable, and operating without warrants as they terrorize members of the public in communities like Chicago.” The petition, which is addressed to AT&T CEO John Stankey, includes a pledge to “not buy or upgrade” the company’s products until it cuts ties with federal law enforcement agencies.

“We also see this as part of a larger strategy,” said Tanzman, an AT&T customer and proud Chicagoan. He expects the grassroots campaigns behind that strategy, which seeks to hold consumer-facing corporations accountable for “enabling and supporting” the Trump administration’s sweeping domestic agenda, to step up their organizing efforts in the near term. On Sunday afternoon, People’s Action organized protests at several AT&T stores throughout Chicago.

“This definitely is the season when a lot of people go out and spend money at retail establishments,” Tanzman told the Prospect. “I think this is a real opportunity for consumers to make some different decisions.”

The groundswell of grassroots organizing against consumer brands that have either supported federal immigration authorities as they ambush and kidnap immigrants at work and school, or done nothing to stop it, seems to be gaining traction. On August 12, organizers in Los Angeles coordinated a nationwide boycott of household names like The Home Depot that they say have been complicit in the federal immigration crackdown, and mobilized to support migrant workers and businesses. For their part, No Tech for ICE and adjacent campaigns have taken direct action to urge cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services to stop fueling Trump’s well-oiled deportation machine.

There is proof of concept here, as well. A similar mass subscription cancellation campaign prompted Disney to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show after he was suspended in an effort to appease the MAGA mob.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act unlocked unprecedented levels of funding for federal law enforcement agencies, with much of that funding going toward immigration enforcement, and set the table for the largest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. The People’s Lobby has been channeling the unpopularity of looming cuts to health care and food assistance programs into direct action, spending “a lot of this year pushing for the state of Illinois to tax some of the corporations that are benefiting from the big, ugly bill, so that our state can recoup some of that money in order to mitigate the negative impact,” Tanzman said. The economic fallout of that impact seems to be compelling more Americans to take a stand against consumer brands with ties to federal law enforcement agencies, which “are engaging in really reprehensible behavior that is becoming increasingly unpopular,” he told the Prospect.

“As we approach Black Friday, I think any company that has anything to do with ICE or the Trump regime is likely to see some significant backlash from consumers,” Tanzman continued. “People are likely to continue to organize more peaceful protests of those companies.”",https://i0.wp.com/prospect.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25318635173472.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 13:57:52.007006

Many EOs followed regarding DOGE and its role in the government, but two in particular have been challenged heavily in the courts: EO 14219 and EO 14222.

Lawful Governance

EO 14219, signed on February 19, 2025, established the way DOGE would operate and the purpose behind the department’s responsibilities. According to the EO, one of the purposes of DOGE is to find and rescind unlawful regulations and regulations that undermine the national interest. Through this EO, President Trump allowed DOGE to begin the process of reviewing all regulations in consultation with the Attorney General’s office. Exempt from the EO are actions relating to the military, national security, foreign affairs, immigration, and homeland security, as well as the executive branch’s management of its employees and anything else exempted by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

This EO was meant to “commence the deconstruction of the overbearing and burdensome administrative state” and to focus the executive branch on ensuring regulations are fully constitutional and follow federal statutes. It requires DOGE to work with department heads in the process of reviewing, auditing, and deregulating areas that are not in line with the Trump administration’s agenda, the Constitution, and/or the national interest.

Cost Efficiency

EO 14222, signed on February 26, 2025, focused on transparency in the spending of the federal government relating to contracts, grants, and loans, with the goal of providing accountability to the American people. This EO orders that all agency heads should build systems, with the help of DOGE, to “seamlessly record every payment issued by the agency pursuant to each of the agency’s covered contracts and grants, along with a brief, written justification for each payment.” Once this is completed, there will be ongoing requirements for agencies and their employees to follow regarding spending by the agency and in the employees’ official capacities within the department.

The administration also ordered continued review of grants and contracts that require approval, justification of non-essential travel, and scrutiny of the government’s real property holdings. This EO also has broad exemptions, including law enforcement, homeland security, and classified information.

Attempts at Efficiency Lead to Extensive Litigation

Presently there are 11 court cases pending regarding EO 14222. Of those 11, four are still awaiting a court ruling, courts have issued temporary injunctions against the EO in six of the suits, and one has a pending appeal.

EO 14219 is the focus of eight lawsuits, and all eight of those court cases also list EO 14158 in their challenge. Two suits were consolidated in New Mexico et al. v. Musk, and in both cases, the plaintiffs’ motions for temporary restraining orders were denied. Four other cases are awaiting a court ruling, and two are pending appeal.

Some of the challenges raised surround the creation of DOGE and the appointment of Elon Musk in his role as the head of DOGE. Although Mr. Musk has since stepped away from the role, at the time, those challenging the EOs argued that since Mr. Musk was exercising significant government authority, he should have been approved through U.S. Senate confirmation. Since that did not happen, the cases raise the question as to whether he has the authority to be in that position and to exercise the control that President Trump has given him. In New Mexico et al. v. Musk, Joshua Fisher, the Director of the Office of Administration, submitted a declaration that explained that Mr. Musk is only an employee of the White House Office, with “no greater authority than other senior White House advisors,” and denying that Mr. Musk has any formal role with DOGE. Both complaints made in the originally separated cases ask that all action taken to date by Mr. Musk, as well as any future action he may take, be deemed to have no legal effect. The consolidated defendants’ motion to dismiss was denied in a May 27, 2025, memorandum opinion, with the exception of allowing President Trump to be removed as a defendant.

The lawsuits challenging these EOs focus heavily on blocking mass firings and limiting executive overreach, arguing that the separation of powers and checks and balances are sufficient. In the still-pending case State of Maryland v. Corporation for National and Community Service, filed on April 29, 2025, Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge AmeriCorps placing over 85 percent of its staff on administrative leave at the direction of President Trump’s administration. The plaintiffs argue that this bypasses Congress’ authority and “violates the Constitution’s separation of powers.” Similar layoffs, as well as budget cuts and other mandates, have occurred throughout other government agencies as DOGE continues to audit and monitor agency actions, as documented on its website and X account. DOGE is expected to continue its work until July 4, 2026.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-white-house-2186187195.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:24.332322

We affirmed the judgments of conviction for both Defendant and his company.

Defendant was the founder and CEO of a technology company. Defendant pleaded guilty, on behalf of himself and on behalf of his company, to 20 counts of wire fraud for fraudulently obtaining and reselling Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. After the guilty pleas had been entered, Defendant moved to withdraw them, arguing that intervening Supreme Court precedent invalidated the theory of prosecution for the wire fraud convictions. The district court denied Defendant’s motion. Defendant also maintained that the district court erred in failing to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea and that his counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him of those consequences. Separately, Defendant’s company asserted that Defendant lacked the requisite authority to enter guilty pleas on its behalf.

Specifically, among other things, Defendant maintained that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because the district court had failed to advise him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(O). Although we agreed that the district court erred in failing to provide this warning, we found its failure to do so harmless. Defendant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Iran. Although Defendant was charged with criminal conduct that began prior to his naturalization, Defendant’s pre-naturalization conduct for which he was indicted, arrested, and convicted of after being naturalized could subject him to denaturalization.

The district court erred by failing to inform Defendant of immigration consequences if he entered a guilty plea as mandated by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(O). Indeed, at oral argument, the Government agreed that the district court’s failure to read the warning was error. That did not end our analysis, however. If a criminal defendant demonstrates that the district court abused its discretion by failing to give a Rule 11(b)(1)(O) warning, the burden shifts to the prosecution to prove that the error was harmless. Here, the Government met this burden. The district court’s failure to provide the Rule 11(b)(1)(O) advice did not affect Defendant’s substantial rights. The text of the Rule references only immigration consequences for those individuals who are not United States citizens. At the time Defendant pleaded guilty, he was a citizen of the U.S., and he remains a citizen today. Thus, a warning meant for those who are not U.S. citizens would not have put Defendant on notice of the potential immigration consequences.

The Supreme Court agreed to review an effort by the Trump administration to limit asylum processing claims from immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in an order issued Thursday.

The key issue in the case, Noem v. Al Otro Lado, is over what constitutes ""arrival in the United States"" within the meaning of federal immigration law. The law provides that an alien who ""arrives"" may apply for asylum and must be inspected by an immigration officer.

The legal question, however, is over whether an immigrant ""arrives"" to begin the process for the asylum claim when meeting immigration officers on the U.S. side of the border or while still on the Mexican side.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court said someone ""arrives"" when they present themselves to an immigration official ""at the border,"" even if that meeting occurs on Mexican soil.

SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY

The lower court had ruled that ""metering,"" or turning away or delaying asylum-seekers because the port was deemed full, was unlawful.

The U.S. provided protection to 54,350 asylum seekers during 2023, according to data compiled by the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

BORDER CROSSINGS PLUMMET TO HISTORIC LOWS; TRUMP'S ENFORCEMENT POLICIES YIELD BIG RESULTS

That figure included 22,300 individuals who were granted asylum by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services within DHS and 32,050 individuals who were granted asylum defensively by the U.S. Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments next year with a ruling expected by early summer.

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives will offer supportive opposition to the government's asylum reforms - but has said they're ""nowhere near enough"".","The government has just released a 32-page dossier outlining its reforms of the asylum system in full.

The lengthy document is topped by a foreword from the prime minister, who begins his contribution by stating that the ""world has changed"" and it is ""our responsibility to renew the application of those values as new challenges arise"".

Sir Keir Starmer added: ""It is more volatile and insecure, with increased conflict leading to a significant increase in the movement of people across the globe.

""Our asylum system was not designed to cope with this. Nor were our rules designed for the situation that sees asylum seekers travelling through multiple safe countries before seeking to cross the English Channel by boat.""

He says this has resulted in ""severe strain"" not only on the asylum system, but also on the ""wider social contract"".

The PM adds that the UK is a ""decent, compassionate, tolerant country"", but that the government must control the borders to maintain ""confidence in those values"".

He says the UK's current asylum regime ""is a significant pull factor"" and is ""more permissive than the European mainstream"".

This means, he explains, that the UK needs an ""approach with a stronger deterrent effect and rules that are robustly enforced"".

He concludes: ""The principle that people genuinely fleeing danger and persecution should be welcomed is one this government will always defend – an expression of the UK's values in action.

""But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane.""

You can read the document in full (if you really wish) here.

We'll bring you more of what we've learnt from it shortly.

A Labour MP has launched an attack on her government's asylum reforms, calling them ""dystopian"" and ""shameful"".

Nadia Whittome told the Commons: ""The Denmark-style policies briefed in the last couple of days are dystopian.

""It's shameful that a Labour government is ripping up the rights and protections of people who have endured unimaginable trauma.

""How can we be adopting such obviously cruel policies? Is the home secretary proud that the government has sunk to such depths that it's now being praised by [far-right activist] Tommy Robinson?""

Responding to her question, Shabana Mahmood said that she was ""disappointed at the nature of the question"".

She urged Whittome to look at ""the detail"" of the reforms and insisted she as home secretary has a ""moral duty"" to ""fix"".

""Our asylum system is broken. The breaking of that asylum system is causing huge division across the whole country.""

She insisted the changes she will set out later will fix the problem and ""unite what is today a divided country"".

Kemi Badenoch has said the Conservatives will offer supportive opposition to the government's asylum reforms - but has said they're ""nowhere near enough"".

The Tory leader told journalists that she does welcome the reforms and called them a ""small step in the right direction"".

But she insisted that her party wants ""to ban all asylum claims completely"" and leave the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

She said: ""We're going to work with them to try and get this through, because what I know is that a lot of Labour backbenchers hate this stuff.

""We are going to do everything we can to support her.

""Unless we leave the ECHR, I suspect Shabana Mahmood is going to run into the same legal problems that the Conservative government ran into.""

Badenoch criticised the decision to still offer asylum seekers a path to permanent citizenship (after 20 years), saying she would like to see everybody who arrives in the UK illegally ""gone within a week"".

""If you arrive in our country illegally, you need to be sent home,"" she added.

""If people know that they can get citizenship after arriving here illegally, they're going to encourage more and more people to come here.""

She also admitted that leaving the ECHR is ""not a silver bullet"" but is a ""measure necessary in order to do lots of other things"".

Badenoch also called for the creation of a removals force, the end of immigration tribunals, and the end of judicial reviews ""that mean that court cases go on and on"".

Labour MP Richard Burgon is the latest to speak out against the government's major reforms to the asylum system to make the UK much less attractive to illegal migrants, and speed up deportations.

The MP, who is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, labelled the announcement ""a further desperate attempt to outdo Reform and chase its voters"", and noted that Labour has ""moved a long way from the days when the prime minister promised 'an immigration system based on compassion and dignity'"".

Writing on X, Burgon said: ""We now have policies and briefings that seem to have been dragged from the moral sewer - and that are even being celebrated by far-right figures like 'Tommy Robinson'.""

He continued: ""This approach isn’t just morally wrong; it’s politically disastrous.""

He argued that the voters who have left Labour since the general election will not come back as a result of these policies, and most fled to progressive parties anyway.

Watch: Can the asylum plan unite Labour?

Burgon called on the government to focus on cost of living to ""win back voters"", and added: ""This failing Labour leadership is choosing to fight on terrain set by Farage. In doing so, it is paving the way for the first far-right government in our history.""

Ian Byrne, a fellow Labour MP who is also a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, has issued a similar statement.

The Liverpool West Derby MP wrote on X: ""The polls are clear, the cost of living crisis is what matters.

""That's where we should focus, and that's why I'm launching the Right to Food Commission today, while the leadership is fighting on ground chosen by Farage, paving the way for a dangerous far-right future.""

He also labelled the government's plans ""morally bankrupt and politically disastrous"".

Many Labour MPs have been left shellshocked after the chaotic political self-sabotage of the past week.

Bafflement, anger, disappointment, and sheer frustration are all on relatively open display at the circular firing squad which seems to have surrounded the prime minister.

The botched effort to flush out backroom plotters and force Wes Streeting to declare his loyalty ahead of the budget has, instead, led even previously-loyal Starmerites to predict the PM could be forced out of office before the local elections in May.

""We have so many councillors coming up for election across the country,"" one says. ""And at the moment it looks like they're going to be wiped out.

""That's our base - we just can't afford to lose them. I like Keir [Starmer] but there's only a limited window left to turn things around. There's a real question of urgency.""

Another criticised a ""boys club"" at Number 10 who they claimed have ""undermined"" the prime minister and ""forgotten they're meant to be serving the British people"".

We've heard a lot this morning about the government's plan to reform - toughen up - the rules around claiming asylum in the UK.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has called it a ""moral mission"", claiming how the UK is divided by the issue and how she wants to resolve this.

Central to the government's plans has been a look at the Danish model.

So, what is Denmark's record on immigration, and how does it all work?

Denmark has adopted increasingly restrictive rules in order to deal with migration over the last few years.

In Denmark, most asylum or refugee statuses are temporary. Residency can be revoked once a country is deemed safe.

In order to achieve settlement, asylum seekers are required to be in full-time employment, and the length of time it takes to acquire those rights has been extended.

Denmark also has tougher rules on family reunification - both the sponsor and their partner are required to be at least 24 years old, which the Danish government says is designed to prevent forced marriages.

The sponsor must also not have claimed welfare for three years and must provide a financial guarantee for their partner. Both must also pass a Danish language test.

In 2018, Denmark introduced what it called a ghetto package, a controversial plan to radically alter some residential areas, including by demolishing social housing. Areas with over 1,000 residents were defined as ghettos if more than 50% were ""immigrants and their descendants from non-Western countries"".

In 2021, the left of centre government passed a law that allowed refugees arriving on Danish soil to be moved to asylum centres in a partner country - and subsequently agreed with Rwanda to explore setting up a program, although that has been put on hold.

The government has come in for major criticism from some of its own backbenchers for the major reforms it is about to announce to make the UK much less attractive to illegal migrants, and speed up deportations.

Downing Street has defended its position, telling journalists that their policy ""reflects the mandate we have been given to secure our borders and deal with the asylum system that we've inherited"".

Asked whether it was chasing the hard-right, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are responding to the mandate we have been given, and the public can tell that the pace and scale of illegal migration is out of control, unfair and placing huge pressure on communities.

""And the prime minister wants to fix the chaos in the asylum system so we can move away from division and decline and build a Britain for all.""

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he said: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""

Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice held a news conference this morning to tout his party's work on reducing spending in local councils.

Our political correspondent Rob Powell asked why he thinks so many councillors have left their party.

Tice replied: ""Councillors come and go. We've welcomed lots of defections to Reform from all over the place.

""But ultimately, people have to abide by our principles and values. We are a team. We're a large family, and like all families, we have our debates, our discussions, our excitements.

""But those are always best played out behind closed doors. And when you've got 1,000 councillors give or take, just under - stuff will happen.""

Tice added that voters ""want more Reform, not less Reform"".",https://e3.365dm.com/25/09/1600x900/skynews-shabana-mahmood-hub_7014255.jpg?20250908115205,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:24.470936

Federal law requires the government to process asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. But in 2018, President Donald Trump’s first administration began a policy known as “metering,” in which border agents simply turned back potential asylum seekers to Mexico before they entered the US.

An immigrant rights group, Al Otro Lado, and several asylum seekers filed a lawsuit in California challenging the policy. An appeals court based in San Francisco sided with the migrants, and the Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court in July.

The practical impact of the litigation, at least for now, is limited at best. The Biden administration rescinded “metering” and instead began requiring most people seeking asylum to make an appointment before arriving at a port of entry. Because of that, Al Otro Lado argued that the case “has almost no present implications, and likely no future implications either.”

But the Trump administration balked at that reasoning, telling the Supreme Court that “this administration and future administrations should retain the option of reviving that practice when border conditions justify doing so.”

In that sense, the fact that the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case was already a win for Trump.

A divided 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that federal law requires border agencies to inspect asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry, even if they did not enter the country. In its appeal to the high court, the Trump administration argued that cannot be right.

“In ordinary English, a person ‘arrives in’ a country only when he comes within its borders,” US Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court. “An alien thus does not ‘arrive in’ the United States while he is still in Mexico.”

But the groups supporting Al Otro Lado said that reading would make a mockery of the asylum process, empowering officials to render “inspection and asylum processing requirements wholly inoperable at ports of entry – the designated places where noncitizens may lawfully come into the United States – by simply blocking asylum seekers from stepping on U.S. soil.”

The court will hear arguments in the case next year and hand down a decision by the end of June.

A Councilwoman Intervened During an ICE Arrest. Then She Faced the Voters.

Months before the election, Etel Haxhiaj, a councilwoman in Worcester, Mass., was charged with assaulting an officer when she stood between the police and an immigrant family.

Nov. 17, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ET

Early on Election Day, Etel Haxhiaj pulled a campaign sign from the back seat of her car and found a spot on the sidewalk outside Blessed Sacrament Church, a polling place in Worcester, Mass. A cold wind tugged at the sign in her hands, threatening to blow it away.

Ms. Haxhiaj, 45, was a two-term city councilwoman in the city. By that night, she would know the fate of her campaign for re-election. Voters would judge her handling of everyday municipal business, but many would also consider a thornier question: Should Ms. Haxhiaj have intervened in an immigration enforcement action on a street in her district?

The encounter in May — a chaotic confrontation among residents, city police officers and federal immigration agents — had grabbed national attention after videos of it went viral. Ms. Haxhiaj had placed herself in the middle of it, standing between the police and an immigrant family. Six months later, she was fighting charges of assaulting an officer and interfering with the police. And she was facing a worrisome reality: Her actions in May could cost her the election, even in this diverse, immigrant-friendly, majority-Democratic city.

The controversy had brought new campaign donations and support. But it had also set off a fierce backlash. An angry man had accosted Ms. Haxhiaj outside a supermarket as she walked with her children. A bomb threat had been sent to her city email: “This is what you lunatic progressive get,” it said in capital letters. Days before the election, a local firefighters union had rescinded its endorsement of her after receiving complaints from its members.

Worcester is the second-largest city in Massachusetts, a liberal state where 61 percent of voters had supported Kamala Harris for president. But its politics are complicated.

Moderate Democrats have long held power, but since 2020, more socially progressive Democrats have run for office, Ms. Haxhiaj among them. An immigrant from Albania, she became the first Muslim on the council in 2022. Another progressive, an immigrant from Vietnam, became the first openly nonbinary member the same year.

As the newcomers pushed for racial justice, L.G.B.T.Q. protections and changes in policing, tensions ticked up. So did a perception among some voters that basic city business, like road repairs and snow removal, had taken a back seat.

In that unsettled atmosphere, Ms. Haxhiaj’s clash with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the police had the effect of a match on dry kindling.

Elsewhere in the lead-up to Election Day, progressive Democrats had big momentum. In New York, Zohran Mamdani led the race for mayor by a sweeping margin. In Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu would coast to victory unopposed. In Worcester, about 50 miles to the west, the picture was less clear. Would voters tolerate a council with diverse views and backgrounds, looser ties to business interests and vocal disagreements between members?

Outside the towering stone church where Ms. Haxhiaj stood waving at traffic on Election Day, a man in a passing truck appeared to glare at her. Seconds later, a car honked in support.

She had written two speeches: one for victory, another for defeat. There was little left to do but grip her sign and wait.

An Arrest on Eureka Street

Six days before the election, in a packed union hall, it was hard to tell which candidate was winning louder applause — Ms. Haxhiaj (pronounced HA-jee-eye) or her only opponent, José Rivera.

Moderators of the debate had waited only minutes before asking about the encounter with ICE in May on Eureka Street, in a residential neighborhood within the district. Ms. Haxhiaj remained unrepentant.

“We have all seen secret police snatching people off our streets,” she said. “My job as councilor is to protect my constituents, especially women and children.”

At least half the crowd roared in approval. But the cheering sounded just as loud when Mr. Rivera took the microphone and disagreed: A city councilor’s role, he said, was to defuse tensions, not elevate them.

“We are a country of law and order, and I think it’s important to show that we respect law enforcement,” said Mr. Rivera, 52, a court officer, former professional boxer and former Democrat who is no longer affiliated with a party.

It had never been in question that ICE would come to Worcester. President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, had not attacked the working-class city of 200,000 like he had Boston. But Worcester had long been a destination for refugees and asylum seekers, with lower rents and a constellation of organizations to help them.

Liberal-leaning residents of Worcester had begun preparing for aggressive immigration enforcement even before Mr. Trump’s inauguration. Some attended training on how to serve as so-called informed observers, documenting the actions of federal agents. They set up messaging groups to share updates on ICE’s movements in the city.

Ms. Haxhiaj, who works as a housing advocate, had not taken the training. But when friends texted her about a conflict that was unfolding after an ICE arrest on Eureka Street on the morning of May 8, she rushed to join them. Driving there, she felt nervous but determined.

“I kept thinking, something bad is happening to my constituents, and I need to be there to protect them,” she said.

Federal agents had detained a Brazilian woman who they said was in the country illegally. After Ms. Haxhiaj arrived, she stood by the woman and her daughters, one a teenager and the other holding a baby. Ms. Haxhiaj shielded them with her arms and demanded that the agents show a warrant. After the woman was placed in an ICE vehicle, her daughters clung to the car, trying to prevent it from leaving.

Ms. Haxhiaj declined to describe what happened on the street, citing her ongoing court case. But body camera footage from the incident shows pushing, pulling and moments of contact between civilians, ICE agents and police officers who had been summoned by ICE to clear the crowd. At one point, officers tried to lay hands on Ms. Haxhiaj’s arms, and she shook them off. At another, her hands flew out and appeared to make contact with an officer’s chest.

When federal agents finally drove away with the woman, her younger daughter ran after the car, crying and screaming. Police officers raced to stop her, and the teenager ended up on the ground. “She was just howling, ‘No, no, no,’” said Maydee Morales, a community activist who was there. “It’s a sound I will never forget.”

The ICE action did not result in a deportation. After four months in detention, the Brazilian woman was released and granted asylum. The police charges against her teenage daughter, for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, were dropped.

But soon after the incident, the local police union called for an investigation into Ms. Haxhiaj’s actions, citing her “reckless interference and agitation of that crowd.” In early June, the Worcester police announced they were charging her with assaulting an officer and interfering with the police, both misdemeanors. (The department did not respond to interview requests.)

“I did the humane thing,” Ms. Haxhiaj said when the charges were announced. “Nothing more, nothing less.”

She pleaded not guilty and asked a judge to dismiss the charges. The next hearing in her case is scheduled for Wednesday.

‘I Saw a Family in Distress’

On a bright Saturday morning in September, Ms. Haxhiaj parked on Eureka Street and studied a list of likely voters. She had been back there only once or twice since May. Several yards had signs for her opponent.

She had always considered neighborhood canvassing the most important kind of campaign work. “If you love this job, you love door knocking,” she said.

But now, approaching strangers’ doors felt dangerous. It was hard to forget the man who had called her ugly names outside a supermarket, or the man who had verbally assaulted her and another councilor as he followed them through a cemetery on Memorial Day, angry at her defense of what he called “illegals.”

Still, a sense of urgency drove her back to the streets of her district this fall. Two years ago, she had beaten Mr. Rivera by just 174 votes. This race could be even closer.

In some ways, the confrontation in May had brought her full circle. As a teenager, she had watched her home country, Albania, descend into violence. Her family fled to Greece as undocumented immigrants, hiding their nationality.

Her father had been arrested on a bus on his way to work one day and jailed for his immigration status. He was released just in time for the family’s green card interviews, after which they were granted the chance to start new lives in the United States.

Years later on Eureka Street, “I saw a family in distress,” Ms. Haxhiaj said. “My instinct was to use the power I’d been given to defend them from the things my family had experienced.”

She would do the same again, she said. But she had not realized how much it could cost her.

As she stood on Eureka Street again to knock on doors, a van rounded the corner. “Have fun in prison!” a man inside shouted at her through an open window.

A Hero to Some, Not All

Even before the events of May 8, Ms. Haxhiaj had been something of a lightning rod, beloved by some residents for her progressive approach to issues like housing, homelessness and zoning, but accused by others of using inflammatory rhetoric and spending too much time on polarizing national concerns.

She had alienated some Jewish voters in 2023 by opposing a council resolution that condemned Hamas, because it did not acknowledge Palestinian suffering. And she had angered the Worcester police force by pushing for reform after a damning Justice Department report last year on police misconduct.

After May 8, many liberal city residents criticized the police, infuriated by what they saw as collaboration with ICE on Eureka Street. Days after Ms. Haxhiaj was charged, a City Council meeting had to be adjourned when protesters packed the chamber, chanting “ICE out of Worcester now.”

Around the city, strangers thanked her. After she and her sons had finished lunch at a TGI Friday’s restaurant in July, the bill came with a handwritten note from their server. “We need more people like you,” it said. “Keep up the good fight.”

Criticism of Ms. Haxhiaj was quieter, but widespread. Steve Quist, who runs a Facebook page about city politics and lost to Ms. Haxhiaj in a past council race, said that her actions were “a step too far.” Even if she did not “slug” officers on Eureka Street, he said, “she kept pushing them away, and that’s assault.”

Mr. Quist predicted that Mr. Rivera would win the election, boosted by Ms. Haxhiaj’s “attack on public safety” and by voters seeking a return to “common sense” from “chaos.”

“We want leaders who talk about sidewalks, not national issues,” he said.

A Close Finish

At the polls on Election Day, a few voters shared their views: A pastor who said he voted against Ms. Haxhiaj because he opposes illegal immigration. Another man who said he did the same because he wanted councilors to prioritize problems they can fix.

There were also voters like Rob Tisdell, 37, who grew up on Eureka Street and cast his ballot for Ms. Haxhiaj because of what she did there.

“I was thrilled to see someone from government taking a stand,” he said.

After the polls closed, volunteers from Ms. Haxhiaj’s campaign headed to an African restaurant where a buffet of chicken, rice and plantains waited. Early vote tallies showed her barely leading. Then the count refreshed, and the crowd grew quiet: Mr. Rivera had surged ahead.

Huddled with family at her home nearby, Ms. Haxhiaj felt her heart sink as the gap widened. In the end, she would lose by 375 votes, 3,956 to 3,581.

“I let so many people down,” she thought on the short drive to the restaurant.

Speaking to her supporters just inside the door, her voice wobbled at times. She pledged to continue to “protect our neighbors” and “push for a better city.”

Through her tears, she had already begun to imagine how her loss would free her: to be better rested, more focused and fiercer, outside the confines of elected office. “An unleashed Etel is more powerful,” she said days later on a local podcast.

Reflecting on the outcome a week later, she saw low voter turnout as a factor, as well as a powerful police union that had mobilized against her and business interests that had backed her opponent. She also saw misogyny. But the shadow of Eureka Street, and the charges against her, had been critical obstacles, she thought.

Still, she could not accept the view that the ICE crackdown, and other federal actions in her district, were none of her concern, or the City Council’s.

“These are real people,” she said. “People who don’t want us to talk about it are either refusing to believe their neighbors are affected, or they are choosing to ignore them.”

Mr. Rivera, for his part, said he had already received a slew of emails from constituents seeking his help to get streets and sidewalks repaired.

“Independents, Democrats, Republicans all want the same things,” he said. “We all want a good city, so let’s unite and not be part of that divisiveness.”

Yet in many organizations, immigration compliance still sits apart from broader corporate governance and strategic planning.
In reality, immigration compliance belongs at the same table as financial controls, data security and ethics — a strategic discipline that protects the organization’s license to operate globally.","The modern employer faces a paradox that defines the future of immigration compliance. Laws written for a twentieth-century industrial economy now regulate twenty-first-century enterprises, while enforcement has evolved into a data-driven, intelligence-based system. This mismatch — outdated law enforced through modern analytics and investigative capability — defines what has become the compliance paradox.

Traditional compliance models, which emphasize documentation and formality, were designed for a different era. For example, an employer might once have assumed that maintaining a complete set of forms and records — I-9s, petitions and audit files — satisfied its compliance burden. Today’s enforcement agencies can cross-reference data across systems, comparing visa filings to tax records or travel history. A process that appears perfect on paper can collapse under scrutiny if those systems do not align — proof that perfect files no longer protect an organization whose operations diverge from its legal representations.

Enforcement itself has evolved from a reactive audit model to a proactive intelligence function — one that measures not paperwork, but control. True compliance is a function of governance: the behaviors, systems and culture that ensure a company acts lawfully even when the rules no longer align neatly with modern business models.

These developments have accelerated in 2025 under the Department of Justice’s recalibrated enforcement priorities. Recent DOJ memoranda have expanded the use of criminal charging, whistleblower incentives and civil fraud mechanisms to reach corporate immigration practices that once would have been handled administratively. The policies now mandate centralized reporting from U.S. Attorneys’ offices and emphasize corporate accountability — including through voluntary self-disclosure regimes and the False Claims Act — effectively merging immigration enforcement with the tools traditionally reserved for white-collar crime.

The central argument of this blog is that immigration compliance must evolve into a strategic governance discipline. Employers who integrate legal, operational and reputational awareness into their compliance architecture will not only withstand modern enforcement but also demonstrate integrity in how they operate globally.

The compliance paradox has multiple dimensions. Programs that once sufficed no longer do — not simply because enforcement agencies now possess the analytic tools to see beyond paperwork, but because they can verify whether the evidence of compliance actually reflects what happens in practice. At the same time, business models have evolved far beyond the regulatory frameworks built to govern them, creating gaps between operational reality and legal form. Many employers still rely on compliance structures that were performative from the start — systems designed to document, not to control — or treat immigration compliance as a peripheral HR function rather than a strategic enterprise risk. The modern challenge is to reconcile these forces: to align outdated rules with modern operations, to ensure that documented compliance reflects real conduct and to build governance systems capable of monitoring, auditing and managing the gaps in between.

The Illusion of Compliance — Why Perfect Paperwork Still Fails

The first step toward reforming compliance thinking is recognizing how easily organizations confuse documentation with adherence. For decades, immigration compliance was built on the belief that tidy records equaled legal security. Employers assembled I-9s, maintained public access files and archived petitions, confident that a well-organized paper trail could withstand any inspection.

That assumption no longer holds. Regulators now look past documentation to the underlying conduct: whether employees perform the duties described in filings, whether wages and locations align with certifications and whether internal systems detect discrepancies. Enforcement has become a test of operational truth, not administrative neatness.

One common example of this misplaced confidence is E-Verify. Many employers assume that enrolling in the system, or using it to confirm new-hire eligibility, insulates them from risk. In practice, E-Verify is a useful verification tool but not a legal defense. Participation does not cure underlying errors in the Form I-9 process, prevent findings of document abuse, or preclude liability for discrimination under 8 U.S.C. § 1324b. E-Verify also does not guard against identify fraud because it only verifies that an identity exists. It does not guarantee that the individual presenting the identity is that identity’s true owner. Overreliance on E-Verify as a safeguard demonstrates diligence in form, but not necessarily conformity in substance.

This shift exposes the illusion of compliance. Paperwork demonstrates awareness, not conformity. The presence of a file does not mean the organization is acting within the law; it only means someone once intended to. Substantive compliance today requires governance — coordinated processes, technology, and accountability that ensure the company’s real-world practices match its representations to the government.

Substantive Risk and Operational Governance — Where Compliance Really Lives

This shift exposes a larger truth: paperwork demonstrates awareness, not adherence. The presence of a file — or an electronic confirmation — does not mean the organization is acting within the law; it only means someone once intended to comply. Even as the economy transforms, six enduring legal principles remain constant.

In the modern enterprise, however, these legal constants have become operational stress points — the junctions where governance either functions or fails.

Notice to U.S. Workers: Posting and transparency requirements under H-1B and PERM remain a key measure of labor-market fairness. In a hybrid world, ensuring postings are accurate and accessible requires coordination across HR, Legal, and business teams — not just checking a box.

Wages: Variable pay, equity compensation, and agile job structures make wage compliance an exercise in real-time financial control. Governance systems must link payroll, HR and immigration data to ensure prevailing wage obligations remain intact.

Location: As remote work blurs traditional “place of employment,” monitoring where services are performed becomes a data-governance issue. Employers must maintain systems that detect location changes that could invalidate labor condition applications.

Duration: Visa validity and work authorization often sit across disconnected systems. Without integrated monitoring, extension and amendment obligations can be missed, transforming a clerical lapse into a substantive violation.

Work Performed: As job roles evolve, duties can drift beyond those certified in filings. Embedding immigration awareness into workforce planning prevents that drift from becoming noncompliance.

Anti-Discrimination: Employers must ensure that hiring, promotion, and employment-eligibility verification practices do not disadvantage protected individuals based on citizenship or immigration status. The same statutes that govern verification also prohibit discriminatory treatment under 8 U.S.C. § 1324b, making training and consistent procedures critical to managing this risk.

Together, these constants represent the operational edge of governance — the points where outdated law meets modern work. Managing them effectively requires cross-functional collaboration and disciplined oversight. Failures here rarely stem from ignorance; they reflect breakdowns in systems or culture.

These six areas are the practical test of an organization’s compliance maturity. They reveal whether the enterprise can govern itself coherently when business innovation moves faster than the law.

Intersecting Domains and Enforcement Evolution — When Compliance Becomes Systemic

Immigration compliance does not exist in isolation. It intersects with employment verification, export controls, tax, and equal employment law — each with distinct enforcement priorities. The result is regulatory asymmetry: an action that satisfies one agency’s expectations can simultaneously expose an employer to another’s jurisdiction.

This asymmetry is especially evident in the labor certification process. Employers pursuing permanent residence sponsorship for foreign nationals through the Department of Labor’s PERM program must comply with detailed recruitment and posting regulations designed to protect U.S. workers. Yet an administrative court at the Department of Justice (DOJ) has held that those same recruitment activities fall under the antidiscrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, at 8 U.S.C. §1324b, enforced by DOJ’s Immigrant and Employee Rights (IER) Section.

Here the compliance paradox takes on a tangible form: behavior that satisfies one regulator’s technical requirements can simultaneously violate another’s substantive mandate. The Department of Labor (DOL) rules compel employers to advertise roles in prescribed ways that demonstrate intent to hire through the PERM process. The IER’s position, however, is that how an employer chooses among its DOL-permitted recruitment options can be recruitment that restricts or discourages U.S. applicants and thus potential citizenship-status discrimination.

The consequences have been substantial. In recent years, high-profile settlements—exceeding tens of millions of dollars—have shown that procedural compliance with DOL regulations does not insulate an employer from liability under DOJ enforcement. PERM recruitment practices consistent with labor regulations were found by the IER to disadvantage U.S. workers.

Since immigration programs intersect with civil rights, labor and national security frameworks, actions taken to satisfy one obligation may trigger exposure under another. This same dynamic extends across the broader compliance landscape. The I-9 process implicates both the Department of Homeland Security and DOJ oversight. Export-control regulations enforced by the Commerce and State Departments can overlap with visa compliance for foreign engineers. Even routine business travel can create exposure across immigration, tax and employment law.

Since agencies now coordinate and share data, compliance failures in one domain rarely remain contained there. The DOJ’s new enforcement framework magnifies this risk. Under its 2025 “Corporate Enforcement and Voluntary Self-Disclosure Policy,” immigration-related violations can now trigger the same prosecutorial responses as anti-corruption or sanctions cases — including corporate monitorships and public declinations. The expanded whistleblower award program also creates new exposure: line supervisors, recruiters, or vendors who detect I-9 or visa irregularities can now earn financial rewards for reporting them. Combined with Attorney General Bondi’s charging directive to pursue “the most serious, readily provable offense,” these changes signal that immigration compliance is being treated as a matter of corporate integrity, not administrative housekeeping.

Initiatives such as DOL’s Project Firewall and the hiring of USCIS 1811-series investigators have enabled cross-agency, analytics-driven enforcement. Agencies now detect anomalies before a notice or subpoena is ever issued — a shift toward enforcement by inference.

To meet this new reality, employers must mirror that integration internally. Legal, HR, Mobility, Export Control, Finance, and Internal Audit must operate within a shared governance framework, supported by Government Affairs and Corporate Communications, which provide context and manage reputational risk.

Strategic Risk Management — Navigating Regulatory Lag

Even with strong systems, compliance is complicated by a structural reality: the immigration framework was built for another era. It assumes static job descriptions, fixed worksites and linear employment models. The technology and service sectors that dominate today’s economy operate through distributed teams, agile projects and constant change— realities the law scarcely contemplates. A software engineer may contribute to a single project from three countries and two U.S. jurisdictions in the same year, while legacy visa frameworks still presume one worksite and one job description. That mismatch creates compliance gaps that no checklist can close.

This regulatory lag has real consequences. When rules do not align with business models, some organizations treat compliance as a secondary concern, rationalizing deviations as necessary for competitiveness. But the rules remain enforceable even when they no longer make sense. Enforcement agencies have shown little tolerance for businessmodel justifications. That imbalance is real. Employers operate within a patchwork of outdated statutes and agency interpretations that change faster than formal rulemaking. But while the law’s inconsistencies are beyond their control, how organizations manage within that uncertainty is not.

Navigating this gap requires disciplined adaptability. Employers must identify where business imperatives collide with legal requirements, quantify the associated risks, and make deliberate, documented choices about how to proceed. This process must include Legal, HR, Government Affairs, and Corporate Communications to balance operational, legal, and reputational concerns.

Governance maturity lies in transparency and intent—in acknowledging when compliance requirements are misaligned with reality and managing that misalignment deliberately. Following the law blindly when it no longer fits the business model is not realistic; ignoring it outright is rash. The responsible path is structured decision-making — informed, documented and defensible.

The measure of compliance leadership, then, is not avoiding every gray area, but managing it with integrity.

Strategic Integrity — The Future of Immigration Compliance

Immigration enforcement now evaluates behavior through the lens of governance. The distinction between technical error and willful violation often depends on whether a company can demonstrate that its systems are designed to prevent and correct mistakes. Agencies routinely mitigate penalties where employers can show credible controls, self-auditing and remediation. Without such infrastructure, even minor discrepancies appear negligent.

Compliance has therefore become evidentiary. Employers must be able to prove the existence of a functioning compliance architecture — not just produce forms. But compliance governance does not require building new bureaucracies; it means designing proportional systems of accountability that fit the organization’s size and complexity. Even small employers can strengthen compliance simply by connecting immigration oversight to their existing governance or audit frameworks. For senior leadership, that means immigration compliance must be integrated into enterprise risk discussions, like cybersecurity, ESG or data privacy.

The compliance paradox will persist until the law itself evolves, but employers cannot wait for legislative reform. The task today is to modernize compliance to match enforcement — to govern strategically, make transparent decisions, and maintain documentation that demonstrates judgment as well as procedure.

Yet in many organizations, immigration compliance still sits apart from broader corporate governance and strategic planning. Senior leaders often view it as an operational or HR concern rather than a core enterprise risk. When executives overlook immigration risk in strategic planning, they not only expose the organization to enforcement, but also undermine its credibility with regulators, investors and employees who increasingly equate compliance discipline with corporate integrity. In reality, immigration compliance belongs at the same table as financial controls, data security and ethics — a strategic discipline that protects the organization’s license to operate globally.

That need has only intensified under DOJ’s current enforcement agenda. The integration of immigration violations into corporate fraud and civil rights frameworks means the government now assesses companies not just on whether they follow immigration rules, but on whether they govern those obligations with the same rigor applied to financial reporting or cybersecurity. For boards and executives, immigration compliance has effectively become a governance referendum.

Ultimately, immigration compliance is no longer about paperwork; it is about proof of governance. The companies that thrive are those that understand this reality and treat compliance not as an obligation, but as evidence of how responsibly they choose to operate.

If the United States kills someone, and if the intelligence provided facilitates that killing, the State sharing the intelligence is itself violating international law.","Several States have curtailed intelligence-sharing with the United States due to the continuing drug boat strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific that have killed 83 people to date. Notably, the United Kingdom, which maintains a significant presence in the Caribbean, has for years provided intelligence to support U.S. Coast Guard drug interdiction, in addition to conducting its own counter-narcotics operations. Concerned that the United States might use that support to unlawfully target drug boats, over a month ago, the UK suspended sharing intelligence. Asked about the CNN report that broke the story, Secretary of State Rubio labeled it “false,” without stating why.

Reports have also emerged that the Netherlands has curtailed intelligence cooperation due to fear that the United States might use it to support human rights violations or, a rather shocking concern, assist Russia.

Canada, which is conducting Operation Caribbe in coordination with the Coast Guard and 13 other nations, has likewise informed the United States that the information it provides is not to be used to facilitate the boat strikes. As a spokesperson for the Department of National Defence emphasized, “Canadian Armed Forces activities under Operation Caribbe, conducted in coordination with the United States Coast Guard, are separate and distinct from the activities you describe involving other branches of the United States military.”

And Colombia, which has long collaborated hand-in-glove with the United States on counter-drug operations, has similarly suspended intelligence sharing with U.S. intelligence agencies until the strikes end. Colombian President Gustavo Petro justified the decision by noting, “The fight against drugs must be subordinated to the human rights of the Caribbean people.” Mexico has also opposed the boat strikes, called on the United States to respect international treaties, and most recently announced an arrangement with the United States whereby the Mexican Navy will intercept boats near the countries’ coasts in order to prevent further lethal attacks in that area.

In recent days, E.U. leaders and member States, such as France, have told journalists that they consider the boat strikes flatly illegal. (France too has a significant presence in the region, including past work with U.S. counter-narcotics operations.) In response to such European legal concerns, Rubio quipped, because many of the shipments are bound for Europe, “Maybe they should be thanking us.”

Suspension of intelligence sharing is not new. For example, Germany and other European States froze intelligence following revelations of torture and rendition in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. And the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces motivated France to curtail intelligence cooperation on the basis that the invasion was unlawful.

The U.S. attacks on suspected drug traffickers are both short-sighted from a strategic policy perspective and morally questionable. Such concerns may have motivated the intelligence sharing restrictions that U.S. allies and partners have imposed. However, as we will explain in this essay, even setting aside those concerns, the decision to withhold intelligence and other cooperation that might contribute to the U.S. operations was a sensible decision from the perspective of international legal risk.

To understand why, it is necessary to assess both the legality of the strikes under international law and the relationship between them and the cooperation being withheld. If the operations are lawful (they are not), other States may lawfully contribute to them, barring any other applicable rule specifically prohibiting such contributions. However, if the U.S. operations are unlawful, this raises the urgent question whether support for them would itself violate international law. In other words, would a State sharing intelligence with the United States be complicit in the “internationally wrongful acts” of the United States? Accordingly, we first conduct a brief survey of the legality of U.S. strikes and then proceed to examine the possible complicity of third States.

The Legality of the Operations

Despite protestations from the Trump administration, and the very suspect claims by a Pentagon spokesperson that “lawyers up and down the chain of command have been thoroughly involved in reviewing these operations prior to execution” and “no lawyer involved has questioned the legality” of them, international law experts who have opined on the matter are nearly unanimous in their conclusions that the strikes clearly violate international law (see, inter alia, Just Security’s collection of commentary and this episode of EJIL: The Podcast!). However, there is some confusion among the broader public regarding why this is the case.

Inapplicable Law: UN Charter, Non-Intervention, and Laws of War

The U.S. operations do not violate the prohibition on the use of force found in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and customary international law, for that rule only bars the use of force directed at other States. Thus, attacking a flagless (Stateless) ship on the high seas does not amount to a wrongful use of force under international law’s jus ad bellum. For the same reason, the strikes do not constitute unlawful intervention into the internal affairs of other States.

Nor do the operations violate the law of armed conflict (LOAC), as that law is inapplicable in this situation for reasons explained below. Nevertheless, the administration, in a notification to Congress and a statement to the United Nations Security Council, contends that the attacks are lawful on the basis that the United States is involved in a non-international armed conflict (NIAC) with drug cartels and that those killed were “unlawful combatants.” It is correct that civilians who directly participate in hostilities (so-called unlawful combatants) may be attacked for such time as they so participate. Moreover, in our view, members of the armed wing of an “organized armed group” (OAG) may be attacked at any time during a NIAC, so long as other targeting rules, such as the rule of proportionality and the requirement to take precautions to protect civilians in attack, are satisfied.

However, whether those aboard the boats fall into either of the targetable categories need not detain us here; LOAC rules are simply not relevant in this situation, since it does not qualify as a NIAC. A NIAC, as distinct from an armed conflict between States, requires protracted and intense armed violence between a State and non-State organized armed group, an explanation derived from the judgements of international tribunals and long-accepted by the United States (Tadić, para. 70; ICTR, Akayesu, para. 619; ICC, Bemba, para. 229; DoD Law of War Manual, § 17.1.1).

To begin with, drug trafficking as such has never been treated as “armed violence,” nor could it. Drug cartels sometimes use violence against a government, but it is that violence that can qualify the situation as a NIAC, not their drug activities. Moreover, the violence must be at a high level to distinguish a NIAC from “internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots, isolated and sporadic acts of violence, and other acts of a similar nature” (DoD Law of War Manual, § 17.1.1). Examples include various situations in Mexico and Colombia, where cartels or armed groups such as Sinaloa and the FARC directed intense violence against the government in addition to producing and trafficking drugs.

Although there was no qualifying violence until the first strike, the more attacks the United States conducts, the more likely it is that this threshold will arguably be reached – despite the fact that the violence is one-sided (although some scholars believe there needs to be exchanges of fire from both sides). But even if the threshold is reached, the violence must be directed at an organized armed group. This requirement is not met simply because a group possesses weapons or sometimes uses violence to further its criminal ends, as many cartels do. To qualify, the group “must possess organized armed forces” (2016 Commentary to GC I, art. 3), which the targeted groups such as Tren de Aragua do not appear to field.

In short, neither the intensity nor the organization requirement for a NIAC has been satisfied in this situation. Thus, there is no armed conflict and, derivatively, no applicable LOAC rule to violate. It is essential to note that this is an objective assessment of the facts. These facts cannot be ignored simply because the U.S. President proclaims otherwise – which, from the recent reporting on Department of Justice memoranda justifying these operations, appears to be the sole basis on which the otherwise inexplicable U.S. legal claims are based.

Applicable Law: International human rights law (extrajudicial killings)

This being the case, the applicable body of law directly governing these uses of lethal force is international human rights law (IHRL). It is here that the international law violation is found. Importantly, even if, contrary to our view, the jus ad bellum prohibition on the use of force in Article 2(4) of the Charter did apply, but the United States was exercising the right to self-defense, U.S. defensive actions would still need to comply with IHRL since, as explained, the situation does not amount to an armed conflict triggering LOAC.

It has long been recognized that the arbitrary deprivation of life violates a State’s international human rights obligations (see, e.g., UDHR, art. 3). The right is found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 6(1), an instrument to which the United States is a party. There has long been a debate over whether the ICCPR generally, or Article 6(1) specifically, applies extraterritorially, an issue present in the boat strikes. The United States claims that it does not, although the prevailing view, illustrated by the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment 36, is that it does (¶ 63). As noted in that Comment, the right extends to persons “located outside any territory effectively controlled by the State whose right to life is nonetheless affected by its military or other activities in a direct and reasonably foreseeable manner.”

But in any event, the right to life is a customary right that applies extraterritorially, regardless of the U.S. interpretation of the ICCPR – a point that the United States has previously accepted, as explained by Ryan. This is also acknowledged in the 2024 U.S. Army’s Operational Law Handbook, which characterizes the prohibition of murder as a fundamental right, and explains that “[i]n contrast to fundamental human rights, […] non-fundamental human rights do not necessarily bind States during all operations inside and outside a State’s territory.” The implication is that a fundamental right, such as the prohibition on the arbitrary deprivation of life, does apply during all operations and extraterritorially (pages 98-99).

Moreover, there is extensive State verbal practice and opinio juris characterizing extrajudicial killings, including those committed abroad, as violations of the right. And in its recent UNRWA advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that State obligations under IHRL (including customary IHRL, which the Court discusses twice in the opinion) apply when a State exercises jurisdiction extraterritorially, particularly in, but not limited to, situations of occupation (¶ 151; see more here). To put this simply, there is no doubt in our mind that, were the ICJ to be confronted with a situation similar to the U.S. strikes against suspected drug boats, the Court would rule that the right to life, i.e., the prohibition on the arbitrary taking of life, applies even if the State concerned kills people outside its own territory.

Therefore, the question is whether these killings were “arbitrary.” The widely-accepted standard for arbitrariness prohibits the use of force likely to cause death or grievous bodily injury “except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives” (Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; see also U.N. Human Rights Committee, General Comment 36, para 12).

As reflected in the standard, a deprivation of life must be strictly necessary to be justified, as a measure of last resort – if a State can mitigate the imminent threat that an individual poses to others by non-lethal means, then those means must be exhausted first. It is manifest that the U.S. strikes do not satisfy this requirement. While countering drugs is a legitimate aim for State action, the fact that there are numerous operational means that the United States regularly uses to stop maritime drug-trafficking renders simply blowing the boats up unnecessary as a matter of law.

In short, there is absolutely no question that the U.S. lethal strikes on the boats are a violation of international human rights law. The violation of the right to life is as equally manifest as it would be if the United States started using drone strikes against suspected drug traffickers on its own territory. Such individuals, serious criminals though they may be, need to be arrested and put on trial, not summarily killed. We thus agree with the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, who labelled the strikes as “extrajudicial killings” – this is precisely what they are.

This legal point is very straightforward. Indeed, as a Senator, Marco Rubio sponsored legislation calling out the Philippines’ then-President, Rodrigo Duterte, for summarily killing people involved in the drug trade. The legislation stated: “Extrajudicial killings perpetrated by the Government of the Philippines as part of a government-directed antidrug campaign present the foremost human rights challenge.” Notably, the International Criminal Court approved an arrest warrant for Duterte for the crime against humanity, because a policy of such killings can eventually amount to a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population.

Support to the Unlawful Strikes by Other Countries

This then brings us to the question of the possible complicity of third States in facilitating the U.S. strikes in the Caribbean. As with complicity doctrines in domestic law, there are various ways in which States accrue legal responsibility by contributing to the “internationally wrongful acts” of other States (for a primer, see this Chatham House paper by Harriet Moynihan). Two are relevant here.

First, a State may be complicit on the basis of the general rule set out by the International Law Commission in Article 16 of its Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that a State that assists another in the commission of an internationally wrongful act will be responsible for its contribution if it is bound by the same legal obligation as the assisted State, and if it provides the assistance knowing of the attendant circumstances. The ICJ has held that this rule reflects customary international law. Second, a State may be complicit based on rules that are specific to the various sub-branches of international law, like IHRL, which may set somewhat different standards than the general secondary rule.

There is no doubt that intelligence sharing can constitute such a form of wrongful facilitation, for it can causally contribute to a sufficient degree to the commission of the wrongful act (for an extended discussion, see this paper and this blog post series by Marko). Consider, for instance, the sharing of geolocational data about a boat in the Caribbean with the United States, or other information about the people on board and their activities. It is self-evident that the United States could use this information to conduct a lethal strike against the boat in question. Accordingly, the criterion of a causal contribution, which is essential to all complicity rules, could be met in such a scenario, depending on the nature and content of the intelligence shared.

The requirement that the same legal obligation bind the assisting State as the assisted State is likewise satisfied. All States partnering with the United States in intelligence sharing are bound by customary IHRL prohibiting arbitrary deprivations of life. Most are also parties to treaties that prohibit arbitrary deprivation of life. For instance, France, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and Colombia and Mexico are bound by the American Convention on Human Rights (arts. 2 and 4, respectively). The five, as well as Canada, are parties to the ICCPR. They are all bound by the customary international law prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of life.

But whether States sharing intelligence would be complicit in the unlawful U.S. attacks depends primarily on the fault (subjective, mental, culpability) element of the given complicity rule. There has been much discussion of this issue in the literature, which we will not examine here (see Marko’s article). We would only make two points.

To begin with, under Article 16, the fault element would be met if the assisting State shared intelligence with the United States, knowing that the latter intended to conduct unlawful strikes and that the intelligence would facilitate them, and nonetheless decided to proceed (a form of oblique or indirect intent). After the United States has conducted 20 such strikes and has openly announced it would conduct more, no State sharing intelligence with the United States could plausibly argue that it lacked the requisite degree of knowledge. This is especially the case for intelligence that directly relates to the activities of boats or drug cartels in the Caribbean.

Under complicity rules specific to IHRL, the requisite fault standard might be lower still – mere appreciations of a level of risk (rather than certainty) that the United States would engage in arbitrary killings using the intelligence provided. This would be a fault standard akin to recklessness, that is, one of conscious risk-taking. As explained in Marko’s piece, and although this possibility is unsettled in IHRL, a lower standard would arguably be justified by the importance of the interest being protected – the right to life.

In short, in our view, any State sharing intelligence with the United States about boats or drug trafficking in the Caribbean exposes itself to a high degree of legal risk. If the United States kills someone, and if the intelligence provided facilitates that killing, the State sharing the intelligence is itself violating international law. This is true even if the relatively high fault standard in Article 16 ASR is applied, let alone under IHRL. After 20 such strikes, no State could plead ignorance here.

As an aside, for present purposes, we do not assess whether the U.S. boat strikes could constitute international crimes, nor do we examine the potential liability of other State officials under a theory of aiding and abetting.

Conclusion

Obviously, we have no way of knowing whether the decisions to suspend intelligence sharing were made after government ministers sought and obtained formal legal advice to that effect. The step could also have been taken prudentially, as a matter of policy. And, of course, it is politically problematic for partners and allies to publicly castigate the United States for engaging in unlawful attacks.

However, whatever the motivation for maintaining or suspending intelligence sharing, the law is clear. The only way in which States can avoid their own responsibility for facilitating attacks that qualify as “arbitrary killings” under international human rights law is to refrain from sharing intelligence that, in part, enables them. Even mitigation measures, such as diplomatic assurances, are unlikely to adequately lower the legal risk, for the nature of the information shared is such that States sharing it cannot plausibly claim ignorance or clean hands. Simply put, any provision of intelligence known to support such attacks is unlawful. Needless to say, this is a point that States should also bear in mind with respect to any prospective U.S .operations directly against Venezuela or other States in the region.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2245807371-e1763386771786.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:57:20.057213

Border Patrol official behind Chicago immigration crackdown defends tactics as President Trump cheers

SOPHIA TAREEN

Associated Press

Published: November 17, 2025

ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) — The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents' aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation's third-largest city.

""I didn't have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it's far worse than I ever thought,"" Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since "" Operation Midway Blitz "" began in September as part of the Trump administration's push to target cities with "" sanctuary"" immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who've spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an ""invasion"" of ""criminal illegal aliens,"" how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

""We're what I call now sanctuary busters,"" he said. ""There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.""

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He's regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is ""far less lethal"" than what agents face.

""We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,"" he said. ""If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.""

Immigration agents' tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. Recently a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration's use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.""

""I think (the raids) haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" Trump said in a recent CBS ""60 Minutes"" interview.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that's had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

""A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?"" he said. ""I'm proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.""

Bovino said he hasn't seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents' accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino's presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker ""wildly misinformed"" while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor's appearance.

In response, Pritzker's office said that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino's ""publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.""

Bovino wouldn't say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

""We're going to be in Chicago a good while,"" he said. ""But you just never know.""

Following days of media reports, there is wide-spread consternation among charities that support asylum seekers coming to the UK.","It’s a tough message Shabana Mahmood will hope will reach the disgruntled voter, the criminal gangs smuggling people on small boats, and even the would-be migrants on the northern shoreline of Pas-de-Calais 100 miles from Westminster.

On Monday afternoon, the home secretary will reveal sweeping reforms to the asylum system in an unprecedented bid to make it easier to remove migrants fleeing conflict and hardship and make the UK a less attractive destination.

Over a troubled first 16 months in power for Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour government, illegal immigration has been a hot button topic, with claims ministers have failed to control the country’s borders.

In the year to June, the UK received the highest number of asylum applications since 2011, while the number of people arriving via small boat crossings hit almost 20,000 in the same period.

Now, after attempts by Sir Keir to stem the flow - the targeting of people-smuggling gangs and then the “one in, one out” deal with France - Ms Mahmood, appointed home secretary in September, will introduce her own sweeping reforms.

The plans are said to be inspired by Denmark’s approach to asylum seekers, where the government transformed its own approach following an influx of people throughout the 2010s. Now, the Scandinavian country has one of the toughest asylum and immigration systems in Europe.

But Labour’s policy changes come amid an outcry from some backbenchers, and human rights groups, who fear they will be a catalyst to further division in UK communities, while bringing disruption and harm to those seeking sanctuary.

What will Shabana Mahmood announce for the asylum system?

In her speech in the Commons at around 3.30pm, Ms Mahmood is to unveil radical measures modelled on Denmark’s system that will tackle illegal migration.

Arguably, the biggest change will be making the refugee status temporary, and subject to regular review.

Under current UK law, people granted status have the status for five years and can then apply for indefinite leave to remain and get on a route to citizenship.

Ms Mahmood will say, under her reforms, that refugees will be removed as soon as their home countries are deemed safe. Meanwhile, the wait for permanent settlement will be quadrupled to 20 years.

This is similar to Denmark, where asylum seekers get a temporary residency permit for one or two years, which is subject to regular review, and can be revoked once their home country is deemed safe.

The home secretary will also say ministers will want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases.

She is expected to say that this could stop migrants “gaming the system”.

Also, the government’s legal duty to provide asylum-seeker support will be revoked, meaning housing and weekly allowances will no longer be guaranteed. And those who have the right to work and can support themselves, could also be denied benefits.

Failed asylum seekers will be limited to make one appeal against their removal, instead of having the ability to make multiple challenges on different grounds.

It also looks like Ms Mahmood will introduce a “jewellery law” that will allow officials to confiscate refugees’ valuables, to help pay for cost of their accommodation and living.

Meanwhile, new and legal routes to the UK will be introduced as a way to cut dangerous journeys in small boats across the English Channel.

Summed up by borders minister Alex Norris on Monday morning’s Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: “If your intention is to come to the country illegally to have a claim assessed, and if you are successful then sit at home, not contribute, not learn English, integrate into the community, not to build a life away from the dreadful circumstances that you may have come from, then that is going to come with much greater checks.”

Which three countries face the threat of UK visa restrictions?

In a show of determination to make her plan work, Ms Mahmood will also ban three African countries from accessing UK visas if they fail to take back illegal migrants.

Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, will face visa sanctions, blocking their tourists, VIPs and business people from travelling to Britain if they do not co-operate more on the removal of illegal migrants.

The move was reportedly inspired by Trump administration homeland security secretary Kristi Noem, according to the Times.

Ms Mahmood said: “My message to foreign governments today is clear: accept the return of your citizens or lose the privilege of entering our country.”

The Independent has contacted the London-based embassies for each of the three countries.

Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics shows that the nationalities do not appear in the top 20 for small boat arrivals in the year up to June this year.

What have Labour MPs said about the proposals?

While many backbench MPs have so far remained silent, perhaps understandably, ahead of Ms Mahmood’s announcement, a couple have voiced their concerns this morning, among them Kent MP and former immigration lawyer Tony Vaughan.

Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Vaughan said that he accepted public trust in the asylum system was ebbing away, but said the measures were “taking the wrong turn”, with a particular concern being the idea to “kick refugees out despite having granting them protection”.

He said: “If the system has decided that someone should be granted asylum we should be welcoming, integrating and not creating this situation of perpetual limbo and alienation which doesn’t help the refugees, it doesn’t help society.”

Labour MP John McDonnell wrote on X: “Tony Vaughan is one of the new MPs elected for Labour last year & in his contributions to Commons debates has displayed a considered approach to issues.

“He’s certainly not what the media would call a usual suspect. I suspect he is reflecting here what many in the PLP [Parliamentary Labour Party] feel.

Mr Norris has urged his colleagues to wait before passing judgment, saying he disagreed with Mr Vaughan’s “characterisation” of the policy.

What have migrant charities said about the proposals?

Following days of media reports, there is wide-spread consternation among charities that support asylum seekers coming to the UK.

Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK’s refugee and migrant rights director, said: ""Constantly demonising and scapegoating refugees in a hopeless and cruel attempt to deter people seeking asylum in the UK is causing social division while wrecking the asylum system – all to no good whatsoever.

“Sadly, this home secretary seems as determined to continue in precisely the same vein as the previous government – possibly now subjecting people granted asylum to decades of insecurity that will undermine their prospects of recovery and integration.”

Fizza Qureshi, chief executive of Migrants' Rights Network, said: “The Home Secretary is taking unprecedented and appalling steps to blame people for daring to come to the UK to seek sanctuary. Instead of upholding their rights to claim refugee protection she is making them out to be a ‘problem’ that needs to be solved through harsher anti-refugee measures.”

Lara Parizotto, chief executive of Migrant Democracy Project, said: “Ms Mahmood's is cementing a dangerous narrative of ""good"" vs ""bad"" refugees, is bending over backwards to change immigration rules to actually make claiming asylum illegal, which is not at the moment, and is washing her hands of responsibility by stating that it's local residents' responsibility to host refugees.”","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/17/11/58/SEI273322345.jpeg?trim=0,25,0,25&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-17 09:57:03.393244

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said in a statement.

In what the government says is the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

The government also threatened visa bans on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless those countries accepted the return of illegal migrants and criminals.

TOUGHER STANCE ON ASYLUM

Immigration has become the most important issue for voters in recent months, with those arriving in small boats from France the most visible sign of illegal arrivals. The issue has helped propel Reform UK, led by veteran anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Zia Yusuf, a senior member of Reform, said the public were sick of being told there was no way to prevent people from arriving illegally on beaches, but said existing laws and likely opposition from Starmer’s lawmakers meant Mahmood’s proposed changes were unlikely to ever happen.

Tony Vaughan, a Labour lawmaker and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticize the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage “the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

In the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 percent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its EU peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain.

Most migrants arrive legally. Net migration reached a record high of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before it fell to 431,000 in 2024, reflecting tighter rules.

’DARK FORCES’ AT PLAY

Mahmood said Britain had always been a tolerant and welcoming country to refugees but she warned that “dark forces” were stirring up anger, after protests took place this summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

The interior minister said that risked threatening social cohesion and turning anger against those whose families had lived in Britain for decades, saying “a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me.”

Mahmood’s parents moved to Britain from Pakistan in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Under her proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from “using dubious connections to stay in the UK.”

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the “definition of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ has expanded beyond what is reasonable,” making it too easy to challenge deportations.

It did not go as far as to say it wanted to leave the ECHR, as Reform and some in the Conservative Party have advocated.

However, the government’s harder stance on immigration has been criticized by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would “punish people who’ve already lost everything,” adding this is “not who we are as a country.”",,N,,2025-11-17 13:58:03.312639

The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.","With dozens of people arrested in North Carolina’s largest city during the Department of Homeland Security’s latest targeted immigration blitz, one question has emerged for many of its residents and leaders: Why Charlotte?

The city hadn’t been previously publicly singled out as an enhanced immigration enforcement target by the Trump administration in the same way as other cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. It’s a Democrat-led city, but it’s hundreds of miles away from either the northern or southern border. And crime has dropped 8% from last year, with violent crimes down 20%, according to data released by the city in October.

Before it even started, the announcement that an immigration enforcement operation would arrive in Charlotte – right off the heels of a weekslong operation that led to hundreds of arrests and fierce protests in Chicago – provoked fear and anxiety in the city.

Democratic leaders in Charlotte have largely framed the operation – which came as a surprise to local officials – as a political distraction ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“This administration ran on rhetoric that is anti-immigrant to score political points,” said City Council member Dimple Ajmera, a Democrat. “We have a very important US Senate race in 2026 coming up. And they want to score political points and use fear to divide our community.”

Democrats are hoping to flip one of North Carolina’s Senate seats after Republican incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis pulled out of the race following criticism from the president who threatened to back a primary challenger to Tillis’ seat. Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is widely popular across the state, launched his campaign in July.

Similarly, state Sen. Caleb Theodros, a Democrat, characterized the operation as a Republican political stunt. “The truth is, this move from the federal government, and the silence from GOP state leaders enabling it, are part of the same political distraction,” he said in a statement to CNN. “They’re trying to shift attention away from their own failures, because they have no plan to lower costs, make housing affordable, or expand real opportunity for working people.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement the surge would “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to the Tar Heel State because they knew sanctuary politicians would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The agency claimed “nearly 1,400 detainers across North Carolina have not been honored – releasing criminal illegal aliens into North Carolina’s neighborhoods.” Charlotte is not a “sanctuary city,” but it is a “Certified Welcoming City,” a designation for cities with commitments to immigrant inclusion.

Immigration into the city has increased in recent years. Around 18.2% of the city’s population was foreign-born in 2023, according to US Census data, around double that of North Carolina at large. And there have been disagreements in the city in the past about immigration enforcement. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden ended the county’s decadelong 287(g) partnership with ICE in 2018, to the chagrin of Republican officials.

The city became a lightning rod for debates about policing and public safety in Democrat-led cities in September, after a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee was stabbed to death on Charlotte public transit by a man with a lengthy history of arrests and mental health problems.

Though the suspect arrested in that case is a US citizen, President Donald Trump seized on the killing as an example of what he framed as out-of-control crime, and he pledged to send the National Guard to blue cities across the country. Three Republican members of the state’s congressional delegation, who represent districts around Charlotte, asked the governor earlier this month to deploy the Guard to fight crime.

Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who is from North Carolina, has his own answer. In an Instagram post with a photo of a man he claimed was an “illegal alien with a violent criminal history,” he wrote, “This is why border security matters. This is why we’re in Charlotte.”

Weekend of turmoil

Border Patrol agents arrested 81 people in Charlotte on Saturday, Bovino said Sunday, in an operation DHS dubbed “Charlotte’s Web.” He didn’t specify the reasons for the arrests or the names of those arrested but said many had “significant criminal and immigration history.”

Bovino – who was criticized by a federal judge over his and his agents’ use of force in Chicago – was spotted on video during the detainment of a person outside a grocery store in Pineville, around 10 miles south of Charlotte.

A man with a REAL ID who says he became a US citizen in 2019 was caught in the fray. Federal agents smashed the car window of Willy Wender Aceituno Medina, a Honduran immigrant who lives in Charlotte, and then detained him before letting him go a little while later. Medina said he pleaded with federal agents to look at his ID after the arrest.

In a statement to CNN, a Customs and Border Patrol agent said that officers had “approached an individual who acted increasingly erratic. The individual escalated the situation and refused to comply to lawful commands by officers.”

Mayor Pro Tem Danté Anderson, in a Saturday interview with CNN, said there’s “fear and anxiety rampant” across the city.

The Carolina Migrant Network, a legal advocacy nonprofit, said it had seen federal agents in “camouflage and tactical gear operating out of unmarked vehicles” – a sight that has become characteristic of DHS’ operations across the country.

“We have also witnessed an escalation in hostile actions, including the arrest of U.S. citizens, physical assaults on community members, and the disruption of places of worship, businesses, and restaurants where people have been questioned about their immigration status,” said the group in a statement.

DHS did not respond to questions about the nonprofit’s claims but sent CNN a statement including the photos and names of people it said were immigrants with criminal histories released in North Carolina.

Protesters decrying the operation filled a Charlotte park Saturday, then marched through the streets of uptown.

Businesses close as Border Patrol agents arrive

Several businesses closed temporarily in the wake of the announced operation, among them a popular Colombian bakery that had closed its doors only once in the past 28 years.

Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed his family bakery Saturday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the shop, he told CNN. He said he isn’t sure when he will reopen.

The officers emerged from unmarked SUVs Saturday morning, “jumping and taking people down in the street, just people that look like me,” Betancur said. He is a naturalized US citizen and said he’s started carrying his passport with him everywhere he goes, “because I don’t want to go through the trouble. I promised my wife and my kids I’m going to be back home tonight.”

Betancur said he doesn’t want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents – not when they’re just trying to buy cakes or pastries.

A company that manages several bars and restaurants in Charlotte said it closed its properties Saturday night after DHS’s announcement. Dubai Nightlife Charlotte cited the “safety, peace of mind and protection of those who visit us” in making the “preventative” decision, according to a Facebook post in Spanish.

The Colombian American Chamber of Commerce of the Carolinas also announced it was postponing an event scheduled for Saturday “due to recent action to bolster immigration operations in several cities across the country.”

Deployment surprised local officials

The announcement that Charlotte would be the next city targeted by federal immigration officials was unexpected – including for local government.

None of the Charlotte officials CNN reached out to Tuesday or Wednesday about the reported move said they were aware of the plan.

City Council member Malcolm Graham, who said he was unaware of the planned operation before CNN called him, said, “It’s just part and parcel of how this administration conducts itself. You learn things through tweets and media reports, no direct communication from anyone in authority. That, for me, is frustrating.”

It wasn’t until Thursday afternoon that a Charlotte official confirmed for the first time they had spoken with federal officials about the plans. McFadden said Thursday afternoon two federal officials contacted him about the arrival of Border Patrol agents but said details on the federal operation had not been shared with the sheriff’s office and they have not been asked to assist with any enforcement actions.

Even the operation’s name has attracted controversy: Martha White, the granddaughter of “Charlotte’s Web” author E.B. White and his literary executor, decried it as an attempt to ride the beloved children book’s “coattails without permission” in a statement to CNN. Her grandfather, she said, “certainly didn’t believe in masked men, in unmarked cars, raiding people’s homes and workplaces without IDs or summons.”

North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein noted in a statement on social media that Border Patrol has detained many people without criminal histories in Chicago. He urged residents to use their phones to record “if you see something bad happening.”

“Local law enforcement will be here protecting the people of this state long after these federal agents go on to the next place,” he said.

Stefanía Arteaga, co-founder of the Carolina Migrant Network, suggested Charlotte’s growing immigrant population as a possible reason the city is being targeted. The city is home to Charlotte Immigration Court and a large ICE field office, she said. The move could also be seen as “retaliation” for the sheriff’s decision to end collaboration with ICE, she said.

“I think there’s a level of, ‘let’s add another city to a roster, create some havoc, and move on’ as well,” she said.

Republicans welcome surge

Some of the state and city’s Republicans, meanwhile, have welcomed the surge.

“We’re grateful to see these brave men and women in federal law enforcement following through on President Trump’s promise to remove violent criminal illegals from our country and those stoking fear about these targeted operations must stop at once,” NCGOP Communications Director Matt Mercer said in a statement.

Kyle Kirby, the chair of Mecklenburg County’s GOP, told CNN he believed Charlotte was targeted because of its large immigration court and the sheriff’s refusal to work with ICE. “When local leaders release individuals flagged for federal pickup back into the community, it simply forces federal agencies to step in,” he said.

At least one Republican had more mixed feelings. Ed Driggs, who, after Democrats flipped a seat in this month’s election, will be the lone Republican on Charlotte’s City Council next year, said early in the week he was surprised to learn it was Border Patrol being sent to Charlotte.

“I’m conflicted. I have a hard line on identifying and deporting illegal immigrants who commit crimes, but I’m not sure this is the way to do it,” said Driggs. “That’s the right thing to do, deport violent criminals. But they are running over local government and it’s causing concern from legal people, legal Americans and legal immigrants.”

Driggs said if there were more local coordination ahead of time – instead of finding out through “anonymous media sources” – the Border Patrol operation may not have been met with such initial fear and confusion from the city’s residents.

“The involvement of people who are elected locally gives residents, legal residents, comfort. Otherwise this could feel like an invasion.”

New Orleans is next, sources say

Bovino’s crackdown on immigration is expected to continue apace in other Democrat-led cities after Charlotte.

The next stop: New Orleans, according to two US officials familiar with the planning.

The president has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans, a Democrat-led city in a Republican-led state, as far back as September. He said the city has a “crime problem.” But the National Guard plan hasn’t materialized, as efforts to deploy the National Guard in Chicago and Portland have largely been stymied by the courts.

Neither have the president’s ideas to send troops to Baltimore and New York.

The New Orleans mayor’s office has not responded to CNN’s outreach about possible future Border Patrol operations there.

Speaking to Fox News on Thursday from West Virginia – before the Charlotte operation was officially announced – Bovino floated a few cities that Border Patrol could head to next.

During the campaign, Sherrill declined to say if she would retain the policy, called the Immigrant Trust Directive, if elected governor, while her Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli vowed to scrap it.

In the days since the election, Sherrill has deflected when asked about the future of the policy under her administration.

“I am focused on keeping people safe here,” Sherrill told reporters Nov. 5, the day after her election victory, when asked about the policy. “I’m committed to making sure people feel safe,” she said. “That is what I’m going to do as governor.”

Separately, Sherrill did not commit in an interview last week with NJ Spotlight News in Washington to sign the policy into state law if legislation to do so cleared the Assembly and Senate.

“I’d have to look at what comes across my desk but I am supportive of most of it,” she said Wednesday night off the House floor. “The directive itself I like, but there’s some clarification on the whole I’d like to see.”

Enshrining the policy into New Jersey state law is a priority of immigration advocacy groups, who are pushing state lawmakers to pass legislation to do so during the remaining days of the administration of Phil Murphy, the outgoing governor.

In particular, groups including the ACLU-NJ and the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, are pressing state lawmakers to pass the Immigrant Trust Act, which would expand protections for immigrants to prevent data sharing that could alert authorities to someone’s immigration status.

That legislation (S3672/A4987) has not advanced since it was introduced in 2024.

“I’m thinking a lot about immigrants’ rights right now,” Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU-NJ, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News, adding that about 25% of residents in New Jersey were born outside of the U.S., the second-highest percentage of all states.

“It’s crucial that we select an attorney general who will preserve the Immigrant Trust Directive,” Sinha said, alluding to the governor’s authority to appoint a state attorney general.

While campaigning, Sherrill said she would not retain New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin.

The Trump administration has made anti-immigration policy a centerpiece of its first year in office, directing the arrest and deportation of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many of whom have minor or no criminal records.

In New Jersey, the administration has arrested more than 3,000 people, placing it among the top 10 states with the most arrests.

Immigration policy has not been a significant point of focus for Sherrill, a former prosecutor and four-term House member, during her time in Congress.

She first won in a congressional race in 2018. In the years since, Sherrill, a military veteran, has served on the House Armed Services Committee.

In what was likely her final House speech, Sherrill said she would resign from Congress this week.

The House is scheduled to vote this week on legislation to discharge records related to the federal investigation of deceased sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein.

Sherrill said she would vote for that legislation “if I’m here for that.”

According to the FBI, victims have reported being threatened, robbed, kidnapped and even sexually assaulted by individuals posing as federal officers. Some of the incidents occurred in New York, Florida and North Carolina, the bulletin said.

WASHINGTON STATE MAN INVESTIGATED FOR THREATENING ICE AGENTS ONLINE, VOWING TO 'MAKE LIFE HARDER' FOR OFFICERS

""Due to the recent increase in ICE enforcement actions across the country, criminal actors are using ICE’s enhanced public profile and media coverage to their advantage to target vulnerable communities,"" the FBI said.

Officials say these impersonation scams are making it harder for communities to distinguish legitimate law enforcement operations from criminal activity — endangering both civilians and real officers. The FBI is urging local police departments to review identification protocols and reminding the public that impersonating a federal officer is a serious crime with significant penalties.

Retired FBI Special Agent Jason Pack, who spent more than two decades with the bureau, told Fox News Digital that the criminals behind these schemes are deliberately exploiting fear and confusion.

""Let’s be honest about these crooks,"" Pack said. ""They are slicker than a boiled onion and about as trustworthy as a snake oil salesman. They hide behind fake badges and phony authority, hoping folks will be too scared to ask questions.""

""That kind of behavior tears down public trust and puts real law enforcement officers in harm’s way,"" he continued. ""Anyone caught pretending to be an officer should be prosecuted and put so far under the jail they’ll need sunlight mailed in, and I mean that in the most lawful sense.""

Pack explained that real federal officers carry both a badge and photo credentials — and will always show them, especially in non-arrest situations.

""During my 21 years as an FBI agent, I always identified myself before any conversation began,"" he said. ""In tactical situations where an agent’s face may be covered for safety, that agent still carries identification and will present it once the scene is secure. Real officers will never ask for money, gift cards or favors. They will not get upset if you ask to verify who they are. They want you to feel safe and know you’re dealing with the real thing.""

Pack encouraged the public to stay calm and confirm an officer’s identity before cooperating.

""If you’re ever unsure, take a breath and double-check,"" he said. ""Ask to see both a badge and a photo credential. Read the name and agency on the card. In most cases, there will also be a marked patrol car and a uniformed officer with the agents.""

Pack said those concerned can also look up the local field office number for that agency and call to confirm.

""There are a lot of federal agents deployed throughout the country, so checking which field office they’re assigned to helps verify who they are,"" Pack said.

He added that citizens should never go anywhere alone with someone whose identity they haven’t verified — and should never hand over money or personal information.

""Trust your instincts and call 911 or your local police if something feels off,"" Pack said. ""Real agents and officers will not be upset that you asked, they want everyone to be safe.""

Pack said impersonation crimes don’t just endanger victims — they undermine confidence in legitimate law enforcement.

""Public trust is what keeps the bond strong between citizens and the people sworn to protect them,"" he said. ""Every real officer I’ve ever known takes that responsibility to heart.""

The FBI urges anyone approached by a supposed federal officer to check both a badge and credentials, look for marked vehicles, and contact the nearest field office or local police if anything seems suspicious.

The FBI acknowledged sharing information with law enforcement agencies but declined to discuss specific details from the bulletin.

""Our standard practice is to not comment on information we may share with our law enforcement partners,"" the FBI said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""However, we regularly share information to assist in protecting the communities we all serve. The FBI always encourages members of the public to be vigilant and report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement.""

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said in a statement.

In what the government says is the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

The government also threatened visa bans on Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo unless those countries accepted the return of illegal migrants and criminals.

TOUGHER STANCE ON ASYLUM

Immigration has become the most important issue for voters in recent months, with those arriving in small boats from France the most visible sign of illegal arrivals. The issue has helped propel Reform UK, led by veteran anti-EU campaigner Nigel Farage, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Zia Yusuf, a senior member of Reform, said the public were sick of being told there was no way to prevent people from arriving illegally on beaches, but said existing laws and likely opposition from Starmer’s lawmakers meant Mahmood’s proposed changes were unlikely to ever happen.

Tony Vaughan, a Labour lawmaker and senior lawyer, was one of the first to publicly criticize the proposals, adding the rhetoric would encourage “the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

In the year to the end of March, 109,343 people claimed asylum in Britain, up 17 percent on the previous 12 months. Still, fewer people claim asylum in Britain than in its EU peers France, Germany, Italy or Spain.

Most migrants arrive legally. Net migration reached a record high of 906,000 in the year to June 2023, before it fell to 431,000 in 2024, reflecting tighter rules.

’DARK FORCES’ AT PLAY

Mahmood said Britain had always been a tolerant and welcoming country to refugees but she warned that “dark forces” were stirring up anger, after protests took place this summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

The interior minister said that risked threatening social cohesion and turning anger against those whose families had lived in Britain for decades, saying “a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me.”

Mahmood’s parents moved to Britain from Pakistan in the late 1960s and 1970s.

Under her proposals, the government wants to change the interpretation of Article 8 of the ECHR, governing the right to a family life. It would make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from “using dubious connections to stay in the UK.”

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the “definition of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ has expanded beyond what is reasonable,” making it too easy to challenge deportations.

It did not go as far as to say it wanted to leave the ECHR, as Reform and some in the Conservative Party have advocated.

However, the government’s harder stance on immigration has been criticized by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the rules would “punish people who’ve already lost everything,” adding this is “not who we are as a country.”",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarksaudi/public/main-image/2025/11/17/4659034-1855157338.jpg?itok=sg4wo2KV,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:29.750535

I’m grateful to all of you, especially our thousands of new subscribers, for your continued support—and I hope that you’ll consider sharing some of what we’re doing with your networks:

Share

The Supreme Court made a fair amount of news last week, but I wanted to use today’s post to reflect upon a story that got swallowed up in the SNAP-related developments—comments made by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche at the Federalist Society’s National Lawyers Convention on Friday, November 7. Specifically, Blanche attributed the Trump administration’s myriad losses in the lower federal courts to “rogue activist judges,” claiming that these “liberals” are “more political or certainly as political as the most liberal governor or D.A.” As Blanche continued (with my emphasis), “There’s a group of judges that are repeat players, and that’s obviously not by happenstance, that’s intentional, and it’s a war, man.” (There’s video here.) Exhorting young lawyers and law students in the audience to come work for the Department of Justice, Blanche continued, “We need you, because it is a war, and it’s something we will not win unless we keep on fighting. It’s hard to get the media, it’s hard to get the American people to focus on what a travesty it is when you have an individual judge be able to stop an entire operation or an entire administrative policy that’s constitutional and allowed just because he or she chooses to do so. So, it’s a war.”

These remarks, of course, did not come entirely off the cuff (you don’t refer to something as a “war” three times by accident), nor did they take place in isolation. The Attorney General herself has filed a (frivolous) misconduct complaint against Chief Judge Boasberg on the D.C. district court; Stephen Miller keeps decrying each adverse ruling against the Trump administration as just part of a broader “judicial insurrection”; and, although the hearing has been postponed for now, the Senate Judiciary Committee had been set to convene tomorrow to hold a hearing on incredibly dubious claims of misconduct by two district judges (never mind that the impeachment power belongs to the House of Representatives).

It’s certainly not a coincidence that we’re seeing all of these spurious attacks on lower courts at the exact same time as they have continued to be the single most effective—and important—check on the lawless behavior of the current administration. But that’s exactly why these attacks are so worrisome. It’s not just that they are remarkably light on substance (and indifferent to the data of where these adverse rulings are coming from, about which more below); it’s not just that they are shamelessly hypocritical given both the behavior of right-wing lawyers during the Biden administration and the attacks directed against those who were themselves critical of that behavior; it’s that, unlike anything that happened between 2021 and 2025, here it’s the number-one and number-two officials in the Department of Justice publicly leading the charge.

Not only is this rhetoric and conduct unbecoming of anyone in the employ of the Department of Justice, let alone its top two officials, but it will surely lead to an increase in both (1) the very real threats that these lower-court judges are already facing; and (2) eroding public faith, at least among those who take Bondi and Blanche seriously, in the lower federal courts. It would be one thing if there were any substance to their charges, but there isn’t. And yet, you’d be hard-pressed to find any conservative groups, right-of-center law professors, or other right-wing commentators publicly criticizing these remarks or the broader attacks on lower federal courts emanating from this administration. I don’t say this lightly, but that is to their profound (and growing) discredit.

More on all of that below. But first, the news.

On the Docket

The Merits Docket

In addition to sitting for the second week of the November oral argument calendar, the Court in last Monday’s regular Order List added one more case to the docket for the upcoming term—agreeing to review a puzzling and controversial Fifth Circuit ruling that had held that federal law, by fixing Election Day as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, bars states from accepting mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day even if they are postmarked on or before it. My own view is that this is—and should be—a “grant to reverse the Fifth Circuit” case, but either way, one can imagine justices from across the ideological spectrum wanting to at least settle that question well in advance of next year’s midterms.

The Emergency Docket

As has become the norm since this summer, most of the news the Court made last week came with respect to emergency applications.

First, with regard to SNAP, we had Tuesday’s extension (over Justice Jackson’s dissent) of Justice Jackson’s administrative stay—which I wrote about in some detail in Thursday’s bonus issue. As I predicted then, the Solicitor General withdrew the government’s application for emergency relief later on Thursday—after President Trump signed into law the bill reopening the government, which includes full funding for the Department of Agriculture for the rest of the fiscal year. Thus ends, at least for now, the SNAP-related litigation.

Second, the full Court also denied stays of execution to two death-row prisoners. The first came Wednesday when the justices, over no public dissents, cleared the way for Florida to kill Bryan Jennings. The second came Thursday in the case of Oklahoma death-row inmate Tremane Wood, this time over a public dissent from Justice Jackson (and with Justice Gorsuch not participating—presumably because he was involved in one of Wood’s appeals while serving on the Tenth Circuit).

Third, the Court on Thursday also denied emergency relief in the long-pending international child custody dispute, Castro v. Brito Guevara, over public dissents from Justices Sotomayor and Jackson. Given that Justice Alito had entered an administrative stay, and given how long the application was pending (it was filed on October 1; Alito entered his stay on October 2), I’m a bit surprised that no one wrote anything to explain their views. But … there’s a lot going on.

Finally, on Friday, Justice Sotomayor, acting by herself, vacated an administrative stay she had entered in a long-running suit by more than 9,000 Filipino victims of human rights abuses by former President Ferdinand Marcos. The applicants had obtained a $2 billion judgment against Marcos’s estate, which they are currently seeking to execute at least in part against $40 million of funds held in a New York bank account. Sotomayor’s order stressed that no stay pending appeal was needed because of the U.S. government’s “representation that it will not transfer the funds outside of the United States before the disposition of any petition for a writ of certiorari.” Sometimes, a party may seek emergency relief simply to extract such a concession from the government.

Ten years ago, this amount of emergency docket behavior would’ve been a story unto itself. In 2025, it’s just another week at the Court.

The Week Ahead

Turning to this week, we expect a regular Order List out of last Friday’s Conference at 9:30 ET. The Court is also scheduled to take the bench this Friday at 10:00 ET for a “non-argument session.” This has been on the calendar for some time, and is in no way a prediction that any decisions in argued cases are expected. Indeed, especially given all of the emergency docket activity, this strikes me as too early for any merits rulings. But a short, unanimous ruling from an October argument wouldn’t be beyond the realm of possibility; either way, we should get some indication of whether anything other than bar admissions is expected later in the week.

As for the emergency docket, we could see quite a lot of action this week—or not. The reply briefs in response to the Court’s supplemental briefing order in the Illinois National Guard case are due today, so we could see a ruling there later this week. Likewise, another pending emergency application from the Trump administration (the “is the Library of Congress an executive branch agency” case) has been ripe for a ruling since last Wednesday.

There’s also a new application from the Chamber of Commerce, represented by former Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia, asking the Court to issue its own injunction pending appeal of new California state-law requirements that, as of January 1, 2026, most companies doing business in the state make a series of public disclosures relating to climate change. Although the Chamber challenged those laws on First Amendment grounds, the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief, and the Ninth Circuit, although it has expedited the Chamber’s appeal, has yet to act on its request for an injunction pending appeal. I assume Justice Kagan (as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit) will, as soon as today, order California to respond—although I suspect we won’t hear from the full Court until after Thanksgiving.

Miscellaneous

Finally, the Court last week issued the oral argument calendar for the January 2026 argument session—which includes the two cases about discrimination against transgender athletes (on January 13); and the emergency application in the Lisa Cook case on January 21. The session includes only seven arguments across 10 slots—which means, among other things, that the later-in-term argument sessions are likely to be … crowded.

The One First “Long Read”: “It’s a War, Man”

Even before Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s comments at the Federalist Society Convention on November 7, I had already been planning to devote an issue to the growing assault on lower-court judges from both the Trump administration and congressional Republicans. But Blanche’s incendiary remarks added both a sense of urgency and a specific claim against which it seemed worth pushing back—for at least three independent reasons:

First, it is just not true, by any remotely objective measure, that the rulings adverse to the Trump administration are coming from a small subset of “liberal” district court judges in a handful of district courts. Second, data aside, neither Blanche nor any of the other critics have offered any substantiation of their charge—e.g., by identifying some recurring error that district courts are generally making in these cases even after the Supreme Court has specifically held otherwise. And third, to whatever extent these charges might be legitimate if they had any quantitative or qualitative support (and they don’t), they are especially dangerous to both the safety of these judges and public faith in the judiciary at a time in which the lower federal courts have been the institution that has arguably done the most to serve its intended constitutional function. Of course, that may be the point of these attacks—but that’s all the more reason for folks from across the political spectrum who claim to take our legal institutions seriously to denounce them.

I. The Data

Let’s start with the easy part. Although you might see slightly different numbers elsewhere (there are some small variances in methodology), my own regularly updated data, compiled by two of my research assistants—Alyssa Negvesky and Grace Kiple—and me, identifies 204 distinct cases as of last Friday in which federal district courts have ruled one way or the other on requests for preliminary coercive relief against the Trump administration. In 154 of them, district judges granted either a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, or both. And those 154 rulings came from 121 different district judges appointed by seven different presidents (including President Trump) in 29 different district courts across 10 circuits. Indeed, 41 of those 154 cases with rulings adverse to the Trump administration were presided over by (30) Republican-appointed judges, fully half of whom (15) were appointed by President Trump. (This all assumes, of course, that the party of the President who appointed the judge is an accurate proxy for the judge’s ideological leanings. There are lots of reasons to dispute that framing, especially with respect to district court judges given the persistence of blue slips. But at least as generalizations, the data still has value, IMHO.)

Not surprisingly, the grant/deny rate varies a bit between Democratic appointees and Republican appointees; it’s 82% for the former (113/138) and 62% for the latter (41/66). But it’s still the case that more than a quarter of the cases in which there have been rulings adverse to the Trump administration have been presided over by 30 different Republican-appointed district judges; and that those judges are ruling against the Trump administration at a meaningfully higher clip than they are ruling for it.

Let me just say this one more time: It’s not just that rulings adverse to the Trump administration have come from 121 different district judges spread across the country in 29 district courts and 10 circuits; it’s that 41 of those cases have been presided over by 30 judges appointed by Presidents Reagan, George W. Bush, and Trump. All by itself, that total (41) would be an unprecedented number of rulings adverse to the federal government during the first ten months of any other presidency. If we just looked at those rulings, and no others, it would still be a remarkable story.

And although a visible subset of the total body of lower-court rulings have been “stayed” by appeals courts (including the Supreme Court), there are three points to make about the appeals: First, they’re still a significant minority of the total dataset. Counting the 22 distinct cases with stays from the Supreme Court and another ~20-25 from the courts of appeals, that’s still well more than 100 district court rulings that, at least as of today, remain in effect. Second, and speaking of the courts of appeals, it sure seems like any claims about “rogue activist judges” needs to account for the cases in which those courts are denying emergency relief—in which it’s not just district courts ruling against the Trump administration. One might also flag the handful of cases in which district courts had denied temporary relief but courts of appeals granted it (one especially visible example is the “is the Library of Congress an executive branch agency” case noted above). And third, although I’ve made this point before, it still seems kind of important to this narrative that, in the majority of these cases, the Trump administration either (1) has not appealed the adverse district court ruling at all; or (2) is appealing it without seeking emergency relief. In other words, it’s not just the data that overwhelmingly belies Blanche’s claims; it’s the Justice Department’s own behavior.

II. The Substance

Presumably, if one actually believed that these “rogue activist judges” were abusing their authority, one would have specific examples of analytical moves the judges keep making in these cases that are not just “wrong,” but that are indefensible. After all, in any large dataset of federal litigation, one can always find at least some rulings by district courts that are stayed pending (and reversed on) appeal. The question is not whether it’s possible to point to one or a handful of these 154 cases and find error; it’s whether there’s some broader pattern of behavior that is both (1) not surviving appeal; and (2) being followed by district courts even after the appeals courts or the Supreme Court have explained why that analysis is wrong.

Here, the biggest problem for those criticizing the lower courts is … the Supreme Court. Whatever else may be said about the Court’s refusal to provide full-throated explanations in most of its orders granting emergency relief to the Trump administration, one can hardly find in those cryptic missives any attempt to rein in particular analytical moves being made by lower courts. Indeed, the closest example—Justice Gorsuch’s separate opinion in the NIH case about which challenges to grant cancellations had to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims instead of ordinary district courts—is striking only in how unpersuasive it is; five justices disagreed with where Gorsuch thought the line was in NIH itself. Ditto district courts that at least initially enforced statutes protecting agency heads from being removed without cause; despite the tea leaves from the Supreme Court about overruling Humphrey’s Executor, Justice Kavanaugh himself has emphasized that district courts lack the power to overrule it first. It’s hardly “rogue activism” on the part of federal district judges to … enforce a squarely-on-point precedent from the Supreme Court when one of the key justices reiterates that they have no discretion to not do so.

Again, the story might be different if district courts in these cases were regularly finding, e.g., that plaintiffs have standing to challenge federal policies only to repeatedly be reversed by the Supreme Court (looking at you, district courts in the Fifth Circuit), or if they were regularly exercising jurisdiction in cases in which it is clearly foreclosed. But there is no evidence of any patterns along those lines—and, if there were, it would be easy enough for the Supreme Court to identify them.

The issue isn’t just that these patterns don’t actually exist; it’s that those criticizing the lower courts aren’t even bothering to identify what they think the patterns of allegedly bad behavior are. That’s critical because, as I’ve suggested in the past, I think there is a big difference between a specific, substantive criticism of either individual lower courts or patterns in lower-court decisionmaking and these kinds of handwaving complaints about “rogue activist judges” in contexts in which the only relevant criterion appears to be handing down rulings with which you disagree. The former is an essential part of a healthy discourse about the role of the judiciary in our constitutional system; the latter is not just lazy—it is affirmatively dangerous.

III. The Effects

In response to Blanche, the “Article III Coalition”—a group of 50 retired federal judges appointed by presidents of both parties—put out a remarkable statement, emphasizing that:

In the past year, federal judges have been the target of an unprecedented number of threats based on rulings that have been the subject of harsh criticism by senior public officials. The United States Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies have determined that many of these threats have posed a credible danger to the judges, their loved ones, and their court staff.

It shouldn’t be controversial to suggest that these kinds of attacks from Blanche and other senior Republicans will only increase the incidence of those kinds of threats—especially as they are, and continue to be, amplified on social media. That is, and ought to be, reason enough to repudiate them.

Nor should it be controversial to explain why these attacks fundamentally misapprehend both the role of the lower federal courts and the proper means for objecting to their rulings. As former Fourth Circuit Judge Allyson Duncan (a George W. Bush appointee) put it in a press release accompanying the Article III Coalition’s statement, “Our founders did not design a system of government built on warfare between branches. They built a system of deliberate tension—where courts, Congress, and the executive branch check each other. Calling judges ‘rogue’ because they apply the law in a politically unfavorable way is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the judiciary in our constitutional structure.”

One might also point out the latent hypocrisy in these attacks. After all, it was at the exact same conference one year ago that Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones launched into an extended (and very personal) attack against me in response to my public criticisms of “judge shopping” in Texas district courts—in which plaintiffs, especially the State of Texas, kept steering nationwide lawsuits to single-judge divisions where they were guaranteed to be assigned to a specific federal judge. Among other things, Jones accused me of directly provoking death threats against Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk (based upon public comments criticizing litigants for repeatedly filing nationwide lawsuits in Amarillo). Even if one thinks the two types of criticisms are remotely identical (and there are a number of reasons why I think they very much aren’t), it’s striking that a single law professor’s comments warranted such a public response then, but these concerted attacks on a much larger number of district judges by senior executive branch officials have been met with … crickets … from the same cohort.

As I wrote then, the point is not that criticism of federal judges (or their critics) is illegitimate or per se harmful; it’s that there’s a critical distinction between criticisms that are founded in evidence and substantive arguments, on the one hand (which, in my view, are not only appropriate but vitally important), and those that are based upon handwaving and innuendo. If anyone would like to go through the rulings adverse to the Trump administration and explain how their analyses (as opposed to their results) reflect judges behaving badly, let’s have it. For now, it suffices to note that any such claim will depend upon much more than pointing to how many of these cases have been filed in Boston or San Francisco; or how often specific courts or judges have ruled one way versus the other. It depends upon identifying the legal points that these judges keep getting wrong—and explaining why no reasonable judge could make the same error.

I’m still not convinced that it would be appropriate for senior Justice Department officials to suggest that they are at “war” with the courts even in those circumstances—especially at the same time as the executive branch is engaged in what appears to be patently unlawful real warlike activity elsewhere. But until and unless the case is made that the courts are doing anything to warrant such a bellicose response, such overheated and incendiary rhetoric reflects little more than an effort to undermine the one institution that the current administration has not been able to steamroll, and for no other reason than because federal judges of every stripe keep enforcing statutory or constitutional constraints against the Trump administration.

In that regard, my exasperation stems not only from these attacks themselves, but from the continuing silence of so many groups, organizations, commentators, and academics to my right—who have, at plenty of other times, claimed to be invested in defending and/or protecting “judicial independence.” If you speak out in defense of judicial independence only to protect judges (or justices) who rule the way you want them to, then I respectfully submit that your definition of judicial independence is bollocks.

SCOTUS Trivia:

Congress Nudges Justice Moody to Retire

115 years ago this Thursday, Justice William Henry Moody retired from the Court—less than four years after his appointment by President Theodore Roosevelt. Shortly after his appointment, Moody had been stricken by severe rheumatism, and sat on the bench for the last time on May 7, 1909. But because of Moody’s age and brief service, he was not yet eligible for the judicial pensions for which Congress had first provided in 1869 (which required the recipient to have reached both 70 years of age and 10 years of federal judicial service).

Borrowing from an 1882 precedent (when Congress had passed a similar statute to nudge Justice Ward Hunt to retire), President Taft lobbied Congress to enact a similar measure for Justice Moody’s benefit. That statute was adopted in May 1910—and offered to extend the 1869 benefits to Moody if, but only if, he retired within five months. Three days before that period expired, on November 20, 1910, Moody stepped down.

For more on the Hunt/Moody statutes, the broader historical politics of the justices’ pensions, and how Congress in 1937, for better or worse, mooted the need for comparable one-off statutes, see this older post.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. Navy announced yesterday that the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean with its accompanying warships and attack planes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said yesterday that he would designate a Venezuelan group, Cartel de Los Soles, as a foreign terrorist organization, adding that the group is “headed” by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Also on Sunday, Trump told reporters, “We may be having some discussions with Maduro, we’ll see.” When Trump was asked if he would be interested in negotiations, Trump said “I’ll talk to anybody. I’ll talk to you.” He did not provide further details on potential talks. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times.

The U.S. military on Saturday killed another three people accused by the Trump administration of smuggling drugs by sea, the U.S. Southern Command said yesterday on social media. The post said that the strike had been carried out by a joint task force called Southern Spear at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Anushka Patil reports for the New York Times.

Trump’s aides are considering giving Maduro safe passage to another country if they succeed in ousting him, according to a U.S. official and two other sources. Others are suggesting placing Maduro under arrest and putting him on trial in the United States, a third source told POLITICO. Officials are also debating which sanctions to lift on Venezuela and when to do so once Maduro has left power, considering the role of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in rebuilding Venezuela’s economy. When asked about the extent of preparation, a U.S. official said, “We have the concepts of a plan.” Nahal Toosi reports.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

The U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday mandated a U.N. fact-finding mission working in Sudan to identify those responsible for the atrocities that occurred when the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary took over El Fasher. The decision was part of a resolution that condemned the widespread, ethnically motivated killings, rape, and torture during the conflict. “Much of El Fasher is now a crime scene,” Mona Rishmaw, a member of the U.N. mission in Sudan, told the council, adding that the mission is also investigating similar tactics in Kordofan, “where civilians are encircled, aid is blocked, and starvation is beginning to emerge.” Nick Cummings-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

UNHCR said on Friday that tens of thousands of people who fled El Fasher are unaccounted for. The U.N. has recorded that nearly 100,000 people fled the city since the RSF took over at the end of October, but only around 10,000 have been counted at arrival hubs such as Tawilia, UNHCR’s Head of Sub Office from Port Sudan said. “A significant number of people on the move [are] stranded somewhere, not able to move further.” Emma Farge reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The U.N. Security Council is set to vote on a U.S.-drafted resolution on Gaza today, which now states that after reforms in Gaza the conditions “may be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday pledged to oppose any attempt to establish a Palestinian state. Hamas said yesterday that the U.S. proposal is biased towards Israel and deprives Palestinians of the right to manage their own affairs by imposing an international mandate on Gaza. Netanyahu said the proposal calls for Gaza to be demilitarised and noted that “either this will happen the easy way, or it will happen the hard way.” Melanie Lidman reports for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

China yesterday sent coast guard ships to patrol near islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo, escalating the current diplomatic feud with Japan. On Friday, the Chinese Embassy in Tokyo warned its citizens against travelling to Japan because of serious safety risks. China did not provide any evidence of such risks. Yan Zhuang reports for the New York Times.

“There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring” of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told AP News yesterday, adding “there is no enrichment… because our facilities… have been attacked.” Araghchi said that Iran’s message on its nuclear program remains clear: “Iran’s right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, is undeniable.” Jon Gambrell reports.

A wall built by the Israeli military crosses the Blue Line, the de facto border separating Lebanon from Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, according to a survey conducted by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon last month. A spokesperson for the U.N. Secretary General said that the wall erected by the IDF has made more than 4,000 square metres of Lebanese territory inaccessible to the local population. UNIFIL informed the Israeli military of its findings and requested that the wall be removed. The Israeli military denied that the wall crossed the Blue Line. Lebanon will file a complaint to the U.N. Security Council against Israel for constructing the wall, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun said on Saturday. Jasper Ward reports for Reuters; Laila Bassam reports for Reuters.

The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal today sentenced ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on charges of crimes against humanity for her crackdown on a student uprising last year that killed hundreds of people. The Tribunal also sentenced her former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan to death for his involvement. Hasina said today, “We lost control of the situation, but to characterize what happened as a premeditated assault on citizens is simply to misread the facts.” Julhas Alam reports for AP News.

South Africa is investigating a charter flight that unexpectedly landed in Johannesburg last Thursday with more than 150 Palestinians from Gaza. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said, “These are people from Gaza who somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi and came here.” After NGO intervention, most passengers were allowed entry, amid concerns that the secret operation was part of a broader Israeli effort to push Palestinians out of Gaza. Gerald Imray, Alfonso Nqunjana, and Julia Frankel report for AP News.

Colombian human rights ombudswoman Iris Marin said on Saturday that seven children were killed in an airstrike by the Colombian military against the FARC-EMC rebel group last week. Marin said the minors had been forcibly recruited by FARC-EMC and were being used as “human shields,” adding that “the armed forces must adopt precautions to protect children who have been forced to take part in hostilities.” Manuel Rueda reports for AP News.

The Islamic State-backed Allied Democratic Forces on Friday killed at least 17 people in an attack on a hospital in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, authorities said on Saturday. Justin Kabumba reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Alibaba provides tech support for Chinese military operations against targets in the United States, according to a White House national security memo seen by the Financial Times. The memo says that Alibaba shared customer data with the Chinese government and PLA, which includes IP addresses, WIFI information and payment records. The memo did not specify what the PLA is alleged to be targeting in the United States. Alibaba rejected the claims, adding that the intelligence being relied upon is “complete nonsense” and “this is plainly an attempt to manipulate public opinion and malign Alibaba.” Demetri Sevastopulo reports.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“We told the Trump administration that the supply of F-35s to Saudi Arabia needs to be subject to Saudi normalization with Israel,” an Israeli official said. Trump told reporters on Friday that he plans to discuss the possibility of normalization with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, adding “I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abraham Accords fairly shortly.” Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

A panel of Brazil’s Supreme Court judges voted on Friday to accept charges of coercion against Eduardo Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro moved to the United States earlier this year and claimed credit for pushing the White House to raise tariffs on Brazilian goods to 50% in retaliation for the criminal case against his father. Reuters reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Homeland Security Department has diverted thousands of federal agents from their core missions like child exploitation investigations, counterterrorism, and human trafficking to focus on immigration enforcement, a New York Times investigation found. The investigation shows, for example, that Homeland Security investigators worked approximately 33% fewer hours on child exploitation cases from February to April compared to prior years, despite claims from officials that overall law enforcement and national security remain effective. The investigation is based on previously undisclosed DHS documents – including statistical reports about workloads, search warrants and arrests – and interviews with more than 65 officials. Nicholas Nehamas, Michael H. Keller, Alexandra Berzon, Hamed Aleaziz, and Zolan Kanno-Youngs report.

Border Patrol agents deployed across Charlotte, N.C., arrested 81 people on Saturday, Senior Border Patrol official Grego Bovino said on social media, adding that the mission was a “success.” An immigrant rights group said it was the largest number of immigrant arrests in the state’s recent history. Eduardo Medina and Sonia A. Rao report for the New York Times.

At least four people died and four others were taken to hospital after a boat capsized off the coast of Imperial Beach near San Diego on Friday night, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard said it was unclear where the boat came from, but said some of the survivors said they were Mexican nationals. Mark Walker reports for the New York Times.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Former Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler resigned in August amid scrutiny of her financial holdings, which appeared to violate the central bank’s ethics rules, according to a document released by the Office of Government Ethics on Saturday. The document shows that either Kugler or her husband bought and sold multiple individual stocks in 2024, a category of asset that senior Fed officials are not allowed to purchase. Victoria Guida reports for POLITICO.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and acting U.S. attorney Lindsay Halligan submitted written statements on Friday pushing back against a federal judge’s suggestion that records of grand jury proceedings in former FBI Director James Comey’s case were missing. Halligan said that the gap of more than two hours in the transcript “consisted solely of the grand jury’s private deliberations,” adding “there are no missing minutes, contrary to the suggestions raised by the court.” Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO.

DOMESTIC DEPLOYMENT OF U.S. MILITARY

The Pentagon is withdrawing hundreds of out-of-state National Guard troops from Chicago and Portland, Ore., according to two U.S. officials. The Guard troops arrived in these cities in early October but were never deployed onto the streets as a result of ongoing legal challenges. The Pentagon has not formally announced the withdrawal but the Northern Command indicated on Friday that changes to the federalized troop mission in those cities were imminent. Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump yesterday urged House Republicans to vote in support of a measure that would compel the Justice Department to release the Epstein files. Trump said on social media that Republicans should back the measure “because we have nothing to hide.” Ashley Ahn reports for the New York Times.

Trump on Friday directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI to investigate links between Jeffrey Epstein and notable democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, Democratic donor Reid Hoffman, and former Harvard President Larry Summers, as well as the bank JPMorgan. “This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his ‘Island,’ Trump wrote on social media. Bondi appointed Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to run the probe. Gregory Svirnovskiy and Erica Orden report for POLITICO.

Trump also on Friday pardoned Dan Wilson, a Jan 6. 2021 defendant, for the second time. Trump already erased Wilson’s felony conviction for his role in the Capitol riot, but he has now issued a “full and unconditional” pardon for Wilson’s other federal crimes, which include Wilson’s firearms case in which he pleaded guilty to two felony gun offences. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

Trump withdrew Donald Korb’s nomination to be chief counsel for the Internal Revenue Service at the end of last week. While Trump did not provide an explanation for the withdrawal, right-wing political activist Laura Loomer reposted Trump’s announcement on social media with the hashtag “LOOMERED.” Loomer had criticised Korb on Wednesday for praising Democrats and donating to them. Danny Nguyen reports for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge on Friday issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from coercing the University of California by threatening to cut its research funding in violation of the First Amendment. The judge also said that the government was forbidden from seeking payments from the university system in connection with civil rights investigations. Alan Blinder reports for the New York Times.

But our priority today is to stay focused on executing our mission to defend civil rights and civil liberties in this moment, no matter what may come.","Eight years ago, early in Donald Trump’s first term as president, I worked with Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on a story about the organization’s Strategic Affiliate Initiative, the ACLU’s multiyear program to bolster a select group of its state affiliates to advance civil liberties and defend voter rights against a multitude of threats in post-9/11 America. The initiative, launched in 2002, enabled the ACLU to respond quickly to the crackdowns on immigrants Trump executed in the first 24 hours after being sworn into office.

Trump is now back in the White House for a second term, with far greater executive power than he enjoyed in his first stint. Unopposed by Congress, enabled by a loyalist Cabinet, and buoyed by a Supreme Court that declared him immune to criminal prosecution for his actions, he has deployed National Guard troops to major US cities, along with a vastly expanded Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to further his plans for mass deportation. He has unilaterally gutted federal agencies without congressional approval and threatened legal action against foundations and nonprofits whose activities, though perfectly legal, he perceives as extreme. He has attempted to exert control over universities by freezing billions of dollars in research grants appropriated by Congress and threatening other penalties. He envisions, according to a September 30, 2025, speech he gave to a mass gathering of top officers of the armed forces at Quantico, Virginia, deploying active-duty military to “Democrat-run cities” as training grounds to fight a war against “the enemy within.”

That day, I had scheduled a time to speak to Romero to get an update on the ACLU’s response to Trump’s authoritarian gambit. He was joined by two senior leaders, A.J. Hikes and Aletheia Henry. The following transcript has been edited.—David V. Johnson

* * *

Johnson: Let me start by going back to 2017, the early days of President Trump’s first term. Anthony cowrote a cover story for us, titled “A Revamped ACLU Takes on Today’s Fights,” that addressed “the unconstitutional agenda that President Trump was initiating to undo many of the civil liberties gains of the past quarter century, from immigrants’ rights to reproductive freedom to LGBT rights.”

Around that time, Trump issued an executive order that banned the immigration of citizens from seven different Muslim countries. I remember how people flocked to airports at the time to protest.

Those days now seem quaint in comparison. We have masked agents arresting people off the streets without giving them access to a lawyer or to contacts, without giving them due process, and deporting them to third-party countries.

Where are we today, and how did we get here?

Anthony Romero: This is the most challenging time for civil liberties and civil rights in my tenure as the ACLU’s national executive director. In a conversation I was having with Aryeh Neier, who was my predecessor and the head of the ACLU during Vietnam and Watergate, he said that this is the most challenging time for civil liberties and civil rights that he has ever seen for the organization since its founding. What hang in the balance are nothing less than the basic rights and liberties that define how people live in free democracy and the functioning system of checks and balances that have come to define the United States as a nation committed to fairness and justice and rule of law.

Clearly, the ability for the Trump administration to enact an agenda that is so hostile to civil liberties and civil rights entails the assistance of Congress. This is not just the agenda of a president run amok; it’s really a much broader challenge to the functioning of our system of government than just one person getting elected.

A.J. Hikes: As a 105-year-old organization, we were not created for Trump, but we are built for this moment, and we certainly know how to play the long game. When you think back to that 2017 article and that time during Trump 1.0, we filed more than 400 legal actions against the administration, including against the Muslim ban that you mentioned, family separation policies, his proposed change to the US Census. We have really hit the ground running during this time: We have over 180 legal actions that we have filed so far this term, so we are certainly on track to surpass that 400 number from the first term.

Johnson: With so many different challenges, how do you figure out what to prioritize?

Hikes: We knew that the administration’s strategy would be to flood the zone, and certainly they’ve done that. They’ve been throwing nearly everything they can at the wall in an attempt to overwhelm the public. Very early on, Anthony encouraged us to exercise extraordinary discipline in our responses. So we had to think about the idea that we are not going to swing at every pitch that’s coming at us. What is in our strike zone as the ACLU? And so we think about urgency—the urgency of this moment, the urgency of this issue. Can we act quickly? We think about impact. We think about how we engage our audiences around this. Can we drive action on a set of issues?

And we think primarily about our lane. What is in our scope of expertise? And where are our partners? Is this core to civil liberties? That’s where you see us front and center on birthright citizenship and freedom of speech—the bread and butter of the ACLU. And then we also think about where our partners are leading. So, where do we lead and drive, and where do we support?

Johnson: How did you prepare for this moment?

Aletheia Henry: During this election, we took both candidates at their word. And just before the Republican convention and just before the Democratic convention, we publicly released Trump and Harris memos. We deeply read all of Project 2025, we looked at all of the promises that Trump was making on the campaign trail, and we took him at his word. Then we analyzed those policy positions through a lens of the Constitution and civil rights and civil liberties, and talked about the way we would defend against those attacks.

Once we were clear on the election outcome, we took those public-facing memos and turned them into 100-day action plans, and it allowed us to get a temperature check from the experts across the organization about which executive actions they believed would come first, and we leaned into that. We began lining up clients and preparing briefing materials and ensuring that we were ready to go, and we certainly were. We filed our first case in 90 minutes, on the first day that Trump was signing executive orders. That was the birthright citizenship case—that’s still ongoing.

My colleagues were fairly prescient. I don’t think that anyone could have quite predicted the speed or ferocity with which this administration has moved, but we took them at their word.

We’re in the process of going back to each of those issue teams and spelling out a longer-term, two-to-three-year strategy so that we can stay one step ahead continuously. In the immigration space, the Trump administration has done a lot of the things that were on our 100-day checklist that we predicted, and we want to make sure that we’re preparing for exactly what’s next.

Johnson: What issues would you say are priorities for you, other than birthright citizenship, which you mentioned?

Henry: I would say immigration across the board. It’s not just the birthright citizenship case. It’s the raids and deportation response, the Alien Enemies Act, all the violations of due process in the Fourth Amendment that we’re seeing over and over again in those cases.

There’s a cross-section there with freedom of speech, which has obviously come to the forefront, and we’ve been in the lead on a lot of those attacks on freedom of speech for individuals who are here on visas or some other [immigration] status within the country. But we see the President branching out in his attacks on freedom of speech, so that is at the forefront. And voting rights continue to be at the forefront of our thinking, almost always.

Romero: The one I would add is that we bucket the current challenges to civil liberties into three large categories. Those are the key priorities or the challenges we’re confronting in this political moment.

In the first bucket, we identify the attacks on individuals and institutions who are ideologically opposed to the Trump agenda. These are the attacks on universities, on law firms, on activists like Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, who are our clients. It’s like a modern-day McCarthy—if you don’t agree with the government, you’re in the government’s crosshairs, and it’s playing out in real time, whether it’s in the attacks on [former FBI Director] Jim Comey or the investigations of the Open Society Foundations. And that’s a place of enormous concern and energy for us as an organization that is fundamentally dedicated to the rights of individuals to speak their minds and associate freely. When the government attacks individuals who disagree with it, that raises it to the highest level of priority for us.

The second bucket has to do with the attacks on vulnerable individuals and communities as a way to score cheap political points with the MAGA base. And here, you can look at the attacks on immigrants, the deportations, the raids. You can also look at the attacks on transgender communities. It’s another way to rile up and throw red meat to the Trump supporter base.

In the third bucket would be the attacks on the rules, the norms, and the system of checks and balances that undergird our democracy. And here again, it’s the attacks on a free and open media, the lawsuits against the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, the squeezing of ABC News because of Jimmy Kimmel through the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] licensing process, or the attacks that some members of the Trump administration will levy against judges who rule against them. It’s about the attacks on the structures that are a bulwark against government overreach and government abuse.

Those are the three big areas of work, and within it, we do work on immigrants, we work on voting—voting is one of the systems of our government that you have to defend, especially if they try to subvert the outcome of the election during the midterms.

When it’s other topics, like the firing of federal government employees, the shrinking of the federal workforce, and others that are not civil liberties issues, per se, other organizations carry the ball. Groups like Democracy Forward, Democracy Defenders Fund, Public Citizen, and others have done an amazing job leading on many of the challenges to our country that are not core civil liberties or civil rights issues. So, it’s really important that we have discipline to focus on the issues that are in our lane and allow other groups to lead on issues that are outside our remit.

Johnson: You mentioned Congress and its lack of action in defending civil liberties, but there are also the courts, and you’ve mentioned the many lawsuits that you’ve filed. And it seems the dynamic we’re seeing is that lower courts rule in your favor and maybe issue an injunction against certain conduct by the federal government. And then, in many cases, the Supreme Court has on appeal, via shadow docket, removed the injunction and overruled judges at the district level. What do you make of the role of the judiciary and the Supreme Court in this, and the dynamic you’re seeing right now in many of these cases?

Romero: I think we need to parse it more carefully than just characterize the role of the courts with broad sweeps.

Most cases never get up to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decides only 60 to 80 cases in a year, so if there are hundreds of cases filed in a particular year, there’s only a small number of them that will end up before the Supreme Court and on review. And so that’s why we think it’s essential to continue to use the federal courts. There are over 1,100 judges who handle over 300,000 cases in the district courts. Over 300 judges handle 50,000 cases in the courts of appeal. And nine Supreme Court justices handle fewer than 100 cases each year. There are 400-plus cases filed against the Trump administration, so the bulk of these cases will be decided at the district court level, the courts of appeals, and that’s it.

All you have to do with the Supreme Court is count to five. And I actually think in the birthright citizenship case, you might get to seven.

I think it’s also important to parse out how the court has decided some of the matters on the shadow docket. To be clear, there have been great disappointments. The Supreme Court’s decision in our case coming from the ACLU affiliate in Los Angeles on racial profiling, where we had obtained a stay at the lower court level, was lifted by the Supreme Court, with unfortunate language from Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh. But we live to fight another day. We will be able to develop the record, look at the facts, and ultimately, when the case ends up back in front of either the court of appeals or the Supreme Court on the merits, we’re hopeful that with a more fulsome record we’ll be able to strike down the government’s targeting of individuals based on what it perceives to be the characteristics of an undocumented person.

I don’t write off the Supreme Court on most of the major issues just yet. I think with birthright citizenship, which is now pending before the Supreme Court, almost assuredly we win, even with this court. All you have to do with the Supreme Court is count to five. So we’ve got three. Can you get two more? And I actually think in the birthright citizenship case, you might get to seven.

On the Alien Enemies Act litigation, we’ve had to file multiple cases in different jurisdictions, also based on a decision from the Supreme Court requiring us to file in different jurisdictions and making sure that you couldn’t bring just one case. The fact that we won in the Fifth Circuit, a very conservative jurisdiction, makes me feel that when we ultimately get before the Supreme Court on the merits of the Alien Enemies Act case—whether this 1798 statute is properly invoked in this alleged war against the drug cartels and against gangs—ultimately we will succeed at convincing the Supreme Court on the merits.

We’ve been also tracking our own batting average on the shadow docket thus far. Aletheia, do you want to talk through how our report card stacks up?

Henry: What’s important to know is that in 80 percent of the cases where we’ve requested emergency relief, we’ve received it. And of the cases that we have directly brought to the Supreme Court in the past year, 80 percent of them have been decided either in our favor or with a mixed ruling. Rulings aren’t always a clean win-loss, but we’re doing pretty well.

We’re also adapting really quickly. When the Supreme Court issued its ruling striking down nationwide injunctions, we were ready to file a class-action lawsuit. That means that to this day, not one US-born child has been denied their citizenship under Trump’s executive order.

We walked into this understanding that litigation was going to be one tool for the ACLU in this fight. We will see you in court, for sure. But we’re also going to see you in the state house, we’re going to see you in Congress, we’re going to see you in the streets, because it’s going to take all of those mechanisms to defeat this administration and what it’s attempting.

Johnson: In terms of strategy, one thing that I’ve read is your initiative Firewall for Freedom. Can you tell me more about that and how it’s going so far?

Hikes: What’s exciting about Firewall for Freedom is that it’s proactive. Our affiliates are really on the front lines of this. Our goal with Firewall for Freedom is to let local and state government officials know that they can say no to Trump’s extremist policies.

The planning and preparation for Firewall for Freedom started well over a year ago. Over the summer, we worked with our state affiliates to develop a strategy playbook for disrupting this radical agenda that we knew was going to be coming in the second term. The playbook outlines tools across our issues, such as immigration, reproductive rights, free speech, so that these municipalities can uphold rights in their cities.

Here’s where we are now: The campaign is in 43 states. In those states, you see some legislative, some executive, and some advocacy campaigns. We have 15 state legislatures who have already passed 30 different laws protecting our rights. We have 24 pieces of guidance that have been issued by a dozen state officials that tell state agencies how they can safeguard our information, our data, our families. We have three governors who’ve already issued executive orders, and five municipalities who’ve taken action.

Just last week, Delaware Gov. [Matt] Meyer signed HS 119 and SB80 into law—two powerful laws protecting our rights to learn and to dissent. In August, we had Gov. [Maura] Healey in Massachusetts acting to protect and enshrine gender-affirming care and abortion rights into state law. And earlier this year, Washington Gov. [Bob] Ferguson signed a bill that restricted out-of-state armed forces from entering Washington. We have been seeing this escalation of federal troops on the ground in American cities, and we know that’s a cornerstone to Trump’s abuse of power agenda. This law makes it clear that almost any mobilization of the National Guard into the state requires the governor’s permission, and it also has to align with Washington’s core values to protect immigrant communities.

So, those are just a few examples of the ways that Firewall for Freedom is proactively protecting our local communities. It’s been powerful, and we’ve been very lucky to have many state and city officials be our partners in this work.

Romero: The theory of change behind Firewall for Freedom is to use our federalist system as a way to deploy both a sword and a shield against the Trump administration’s policies on civil liberties and civil rights. If you can convince governors, attorneys general, mayors, and city councils to enact policies that stand in the way of government overreach, then that provides some meaningful protection against the worst abuses.

Johnson: You mentioned Trump’s threats to crack down on foundations like the Open Society Foundations (OSF), on universities, and law firms. At SSIR, we represent the social sector and the people who work at such organizations. What do you make of how the organizations, philanthropies, nonprofits, and universities are responding?

Hikes: We should start by saying that the attack on OSF is baseless and a challenge to the values that make this country great. And Anthony mentioned this modern-day McCarthy moment that we’re in. That is exactly what this feels like, turning the whole weight of the DOJ [Department of Justice] against organizations that are speaking out against this administration’s un-American agenda.

We have to remind folks that the President can’t rewrite the Constitution via a memo. And I think we’ve seen real strength in numbers.

Just last week, we saw a presidential memorandum authorizing the government to investigate nonprofits, activists, and donors; and using this overbroad label of terrorism and conspiracy against rights; and targeting individuals, institutions, and communities to score political points, disrupting checks and balances, and consolidating power. It’s all a part of a larger strategy and agenda, and it’s shameful and dangerous.

We have to remind folks that the President can’t rewrite the Constitution via a memo. And I think we’ve seen real strength in numbers. We see coalitions in the philanthropic sector coming together. We see the same thing with our nonprofit communities. We see it as well with corporations and law firms coming together, standing up, and saying that we will not stand for this. We know that this administration is sending up test balloons to see what will actually fly. It’s really imperative in this moment that we are coming together and building those kind of coalitions to push back and draw the line.

On a personal point, when it comes to the ACLU, we are well aware that we may be targeted by this administration. We’ve been preparing for that moment. And we have plans internally and externally. But our priority today is to stay focused on executing our mission to defend civil rights and civil liberties in this moment, no matter what may come.

Romero: There is a sense of real solidarity in the nonprofit sector. Unlike what you saw with some of the nation’s largest law firms just capitulating to Trump’s extortionist policies, or the universities, some of which settled claims against them, the nonprofit sector has been much more unified in its response, and I think we’ve learned from the mistakes of the universities and the law firms that didn’t stick together. There’s been a real effort to make sure that nonprofits across areas and across the political spectrum stay together as one. [Former Associate Attorney General] Vanita Gupta has organized a NATO for nonprofits, and the sector has really come together.

We recently organized a conference call with Public Citizen and Democracy Defenders Fund for nonprofits in the wake of the executive orders that were signed by the President allowing them to investigate domestic terrorist groups. We had 7,000 nonprofits show up on that call. I am proud of the way in which the nonprofit sector has understood that we are in this together. There are lines of communication that I have not seen in 24 years as CEO of a major nonprofit. I have never seen this level of alignment of sharing of information, of referring donors, of dividing work, of providing support and assistance and advice, and that’s because the nonprofit sector realizes what we’re up against is going to require a much more coordinated response. Collective solidarity is key to our individual success.

Johnson: I am also curious about public sentiment. Back in 2017, after Trump was first elected, the ACLU netted a huge windfall of donations from a public worried about civil liberties. Do you feel like the public is again energized? What are you seeing from your supporters and from people at large?

Romero: In 2017, I think there was a response from the public that was largely driven by surprise and shock. Folks rushed to the airports on the Muslim ban weekend. We saw these large spikes of contributions to our website around the Muslim ban and family separation. With Trump’s reelection, we don’t see those crescendo points like we did the first time around. We see a more steady increase of concern, building off where we were at the end of the Biden administration.

I also think some people are turned off by politics in this moment, and tired of the acrimony and divisiveness. Some people just want to put their heads in the sand. Some folks are feeling that it’s not a surprise that Donald Trump is president. Trump represents larger portions of public sentiment. And at the same time, there are many more people who are trying to figure out how to make a difference in this time. You may not see the large women’s marches that you saw in 2017, but there’s much more activism happening at the state and local levels. There are people who are taking action, going to local rallies, signing up to be monthly contributors, because they understand that there’s not one flashpoint and there’s not one silver bullet. They realize that you have to stay on this like water on stone. There’s real, growing activism that we ought not to overlook or downplay.

Henry: What we have seen is people being willing to give more of their time to this effort. So, we’ve had tens of thousands of people attend our Know Your Rights trainings. We have hundreds of thousands of active volunteers. These aren’t people sitting on an email list; they’re the folks working beside us to pass those Firewall measures that AJ was talking about. They’re hosting education events in their communities so that folks understand the impact. They’re engaging with their members at town halls and other events locally. And I think that that’s really important.

Erica Chenoweth and the Crowd Counting Consortium at Harvard University have measured an increase in crowds showing up to demonstrate in comparison to the last Trump administration. It just doesn’t look like the Women’s March. There are more events across more places, and so it’s more of this local activism. The No Kings rallies back in June are a great example of this: Five million people rallied at over 2,000 events across the country. And so that’s 100,000 people in Philadelphia, and 200,000 in New York, and 500,000 in Boston, but it’s also 400 people in Pentwater, Michigan, where the population size is 800. So you get half the town showing up to condemn President Trump’s escalating abuses of power.

We’re taking to the streets again on October 18 with our partners across the country in a similar show of condemnation of this president’s ongoing abuses.

Romero: Sometimes people ask me, “Are we in a constitutional crisis? Is everything lost?” And my answer is, we are in a constitutional crisis if we accept it, and we’re not in a constitutional crisis if we resist it. We need to give people a sense of agency, turn them into protagonists, rather than spectators. That’s critical for groups like ours, and that’s why we work really hard to find meaningful ways for folks to make a difference. If you tell them, “Call your member of Congress” or, “Write a letter to your member of Congress,” people’s eyes immediately roll. They don’t think that Congress is terribly functional or relevant at the moment. But if you tell them, “Let’s stiffen the spine of your local attorney general or your governor, let’s make sure that we eliminate the programs that allow local officials to work with federal immigration enforcement, let’s get the city council to enact laws that protect immigrants and that make the local prisons and jails off-limits to federal immigration enforcement,” then you give them something meaningful to do that they feel is worth their time, energy, and sweat equity.

This momentum is building as people increasingly realize just how far the Trump administration is pushing its agenda. On the issue of immigration, the public opinion was much more with President Trump at the beginning of his first year than it is now. He promised to deport the criminals, the drug dealers, the cartels. Now they see that he’s deporting good folk, people who are the members of our local communities, not the criminal aliens that he promised. And I think that’s creating a backlash to some of the very policies that they are beginning to scale up. Public response and engagement will scale up in response.

Having a strong, local infrastructure among our state affiliates is critical to fighting off the worst of the abuses of the Trump administration.

Johnson: You mentioned your affiliate network—the ACLU has affiliates in all 50 states, in Puerto Rico, and in DC. The cover story you cowrote, Anthony, back in 2017, talked about the ACLU’s Strategic Affiliate Initiative (SAI), where you devoted financial support to select states in an overall strategy to protect civil liberties. Could you update us on the initiative?

Romero: Thank God we launched the Strategic Affiliate Initiative. To do organizational development, you have to do it over the long term. When we first launched our initiative, we realized—and we realize even more so now—that the locus of activity for the battle for civil liberties and civil rights plays out in local communities. The deportations happen in local communities. The abridgment of freedom of speech happens in local communities. The deployment of the National Guard or federal forces happens in cities like Portland [Ore.]; Chicago; Washington, DC; Los Angeles; Memphis [Tenn.]. And so having strong, local infrastructure among our state affiliates is critical to fighting off the worst of the abuses of the Trump administration, because that’s where the rubber’s hitting the road.

Over the past several years, we have consciously focused on growing our Southern affiliates. That is the most recent iteration of our Strategic Affiliate Initiative. Increasingly, you see these issues play out in Texas—for instance, the redistricting battle to try to redraw the maps of Texas’ congressional districts to put their thumb on the scale in the midterm elections. It’s critically important that we be strong in a place like Texas. In Florida, we’re holding off the worst of the abuses. The head of our Florida office, Bacardi Jackson, says that the nation’s going in the same direction that Florida’s been heading in for years. And so it’s really important for us to be able to fight off some of those challenges in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz, for instance: Our legal challenge to the creation of that prison camp for immigrants has met with success. If we didn’t have the boots on the ground to be able to challenge that in real time, we’d be struggling to do it from afar in New York City or Washington. The Strategic Affiliate Initiative was exactly the right investment so that we could not just enact policy reforms like Firewall for Freedom but also fend off the worst of the civil liberties violations in really difficult states, like Florida or Texas or Alabama.

What was it that you told me the other day, Aletheia, about the Census on the South?

Henry: I read reporting recently that the 2030 Census is going to demonstrate a population shift to the South. States like New York and California are losing population relative to the South, and we will be redistricting accordingly, so it’s good that we have these strong, sustainable affiliate organizations built there for the future fights.

I think it’s really interesting that the Southern Collective, the third iteration of our SAI, was born from the affiliates themselves. In 2019, these 12 affiliates came together and lifted up the challenges that they were having and asked for national investment. What started as a $15 million investment in the Southern Collective has now become a $51 million, five-year investment in the South. And because voting rights is a generational struggle in the South, a lot of our work has focused on voting rights. We were able to partner with our Alabama affiliate on our Allen v. Milligan case that made it up to the Supreme Court—a redistricting case under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Across the South now, we have these data dashboards that have demographic voting and turnout patterns for our southern states. In Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia, we’re monitoring voter-roll purges so that we can see when they’re trying to force people off the rolls and get them back on quickly. And in Florida, we’ve built on those demographic dashboards to track inclement weather that may affect polling locations, to track social media reports of violent groups that may be attempting to target those locations, so we can do that rapid-response voter-protection work when the time comes.

Romero: In order to be ready for a moment like the one we’re in, it takes years of planning and preparation, of anticipating where you think the challenges will go. We have 2,200 staff nationwide at the ACLU, and 1,600-plus of them are in the state offices. That reflects a conscious decision that the only way you can be effective is to be proximate to the problems. And so you have local lawyers, local activists, local organizers, people who are embedded in these communities, helping solve the problems that manifest in their communities.

Johnson: One last question about the midterms next year: How worried are you about free and fair elections in our country? And what do you have planned for the midterms?

Henry: I don’t think we ever stop thinking about how to protect the people’s voice, and certainly, given Trump’s voting executive order, this midcycle redistricting, his targeting of mail-in voting, and other efforts of the Trump administration, we’re monitoring and responding to all of that. We’ve had success in blocking many of these attempts in the past. We have a playbook, and we have been involved in election protection in many states for years now, and I mentioned a lot of our work in the South. Our first call with our affiliates on having a plan to safeguard the election is tomorrow [October 1, 2025]. So we are preparing for the fights ahead. We certainly will be involved in the 2025 cycle, even though it’s a lighter election year, just to make sure that voting is as free and fair as possible, but we are ramping up all those efforts for 2026 and 2028. And it’s not just us: We have a whole network of groups that we work very closely with.

Romero: And our work to secure the right to vote and to defend the franchise is not animated by a desire to help one party or one candidate get elected. We are agnostic about the outcomes. Our sole goal is to ensure that people cast an informed vote. We will inform them about the records and the history and the backgrounds of candidates. But we never tell people who to vote for. We want voters to be informed, and if they wish to cast a vote, our job is to make sure it is meaningfully counted.

In one of the voting rights challenges we had during the first Trump administration, they were trying to shut down drive-through polling booths in Harris County, Texas. Our lead plaintiff was a Republican. Shutting down drive-through voting affects Democrats as much as Republicans, and our goal was to make sure that voters were able to cast their votes. It’s the same thing with mail-in ballots. A lot of elderly people vote by mail. And they vote Republican, and they vote Democrat, and it doesn’t matter which party they vote for—they should just be able to cast their vote. That is the animating principle for us: making sure that government officials don’t cynically try to shave off certain types of voters who they don’t believe vote for their party or their candidates. We believe that the voters should pick our elected officials, not that the elected officials should pick the voters.",https://ssir.org/images/articles/winter-2026-feature-aclu-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:57:11.111251

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda.
It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens).
There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said.
Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration.","Many members of Colorado’s Latino community fear they could be arrested by federal immigration authorities and have changed their daily lives to avoid it, a recent poll found — even as Latinos remain predominantly focused on economic concerns ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

“In every aspect of life, Latinos have attenuated their normal behavior and avoided critical locations, like work and school, in order to stay clear of the immigration (enforcement) surge,” pollster Gary Segura told reporters upon releasing the results.

The issues identified more broadly in the Colorado Latino Agenda poll, which was released earlier this month, reflect a growing national consensus among all voters, not just Latinos. The overwhelming concern with affordability — respondents’ top four issues all related to the cost of living and the economy — shows that economic fears have endured through President Donald Trump’s first nine months in office, with recent elections across the country notching wins for Democrats who focused on the issue.

But the results also revealed mounting fear about an erosion of civil rights and discontent with the Republican president’s efforts to rapidly arrest and deport millions of immigrants without proper legal status.

Forty percent of the registered voters who participated in the survey said they or their communities feared that immigration authorities would arrest them, even if they’re U.S. citizens or have some kind of legal status. And 30% said they or their communities feared interacting with or calling the police, while 28% said they or their communities feared attending regular immigration proceedings because they could be arrested.

Asked whether civil rights had improved under Trump, 62% said they hadn’t, compared to 20% who said they had.

Those results also reflect that Latino voters are aware of how the federal government is carrying out its immigration agenda. Immigrants have repeatedly been arrested while attending regular immigration hearings, as advocates have said and court filings reviewed by The Denver Post have indicated.

ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, reported last month that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration authorities nationwide this year. Immigrants with legal status and work permits, like a Douglas County teacher arrested last month, have also been caught up in raids and arrests.

“The actions of the Trump administration are fundamentally changing the way that Latino citizens are interacting with their government,” said Phil Chen, a political science professor at the University of Denver who reviewed the poll. “A quarter of them say that they or their community are missing classes because parents are worried about being arrested driving to school. I read (those results) as deeply, deeply troubling.”

About 23% of Colorado residents are of Hispanic or Latino origin, according to the State Demography Office.

The poll was conducted by a bipartisan polling team last month. It surveyed 400 Latino registered voters in Colorado (meaning all respondents are U.S. citizens). Its margin of error was plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.

Concerns with Trump, Republicans

Latino Coloradans, who have tended to vote Democratic but not monolithically, also expressed mounting concerns with the Trump administration and Republicans who control Congress. Eighty-one percent of respondents said they were concerned that Congress wasn’t acting as a check on Trump. Asked who was to blame for the recent government shutdown, 61% said the president and his party, compared to 23% who blamed Democrats. Two-thirds disapproved of Trump’s performance in office.

There was also a “very concerning” bleed of support from formerly Trump-supporting Latino voters, Segura said. More than a third of respondents said they’d voted for Trump in 2024.

The vast majority of that group — 80% — said they would vote for him again. But 13% said they wouldn’t, and the remaining 7% said they were unsure. Of those who supported then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, 91% said they would vote for her again, and the remaining share said they weren’t sure.

“When there’s a party that holds all of the levers of power in the federal government, (voters) are going to blame that party for things they think are not going well and probably give them credit for things that are going well,” Chen said. “This is the pattern we expect to find in every off-year and midterm election.

“So if you were (U.S. Rep.) Gabe Evans or the state Republican Party, I think it’s really important to start thinking about how you talk about issues around affordability — around housing costs, food costs, inflation, job opportunities, things like that.”

Evans, a Republican, represents the 8th Congressional District stretching from the northern Denver suburbs to Greeley, and it’s one of the most contested congressional seats in the country. Much of his successful 2024 campaign focused on immigration and public safety.

‘Latinos are looking for leadership’

Still, criticism of Trump doesn’t necessarily mean Latino voters are running straight into the arms of the Democratic Party, said Alex Sánchez, the president and CEO of Voces Unidas, which is part of the coalition that released the poll.

Fifty-two percent of self-identified independents surveyed in the poll said they either didn’t know which party they’d support next year or that they wanted to support someone else. (A plurality of independents, 35%, said they would support Democrats, compared to 12% for Republicans.)

“There are warning signs to both parties in the data,” Sánchez said in an interview. “While, yes, Colorado Democrats fare better … they’re not too far from the danger zone. That’s what we see in the data: a clear sign that Latinos are looking for leadership, are looking for results.”

He added about Latinos: “We are not brand loyal. We don’t carry the party loyalty the same way that other voters do. Latinas and Latinos historically vote based on value and vote based on results, instead of party sticker and party label.”

Despite the unpopularity of the Trump administration’s mass-deportation efforts, affordability concerns were still far and away the top concerns for voters. Forty-eight percent of respondents said the cost of living and inflation were their top priority.

Housing affordability, jobs and the economy, and health care were the next-highest priorities, followed by gun violence and, in sixth, immigration. More than half of respondents said it was most important for election officials to tackle either prices and affordability, or wages and good jobs.

That’s unsurprising, Chen said. Affordability was a dominant issue in elections elsewhere in the U.S. earlier this month, he said, and has remained a top issue for all Colorado voters for years.

With next year’s midterms approaching, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration had begun floating new affordability ideas in recent weeks as it faces the reality that Americans are still pessimistic about the economy as they struggle with higher prices.

“You can think of (the immigration crackdown) as a problem. It can affect your impressions of President Trump,” Chen said. “But when it comes to how (Latinos) are going to vote, (they’re) going to vote on the thing that’s really affected me, which is the economy.”",https://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-L-immigrant-rights-RJS-13431.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:21.016921

Dr Zazai warned that political rhetoric has become increasingly dehumanising — and that adopting the tone of the far right is both morally wrong and socially dangerous.

“People fleeing war, persecution and trauma are not a burden. They are not a threat. They are human beings. Yet too often, the way we talk about them strips away their dignity. When politicians use language that echoes the far right, they don’t defeat extremism — they legitimise it.”

“Imagine arriving here with nothing, being placed in cold, overcrowded accommodation, and surviving on just a few pounds a week. Then imagine being told your right to remain may be denied simply because your family doesn’t meet new thresholds.

“We can protect our borders without undermining our humanity. We can enforce rules without embracing rhetoric that divides. The UK must show that firmness and compassion can go hand in hand — and that the dignity of every person remains at the heart of our asylum system.”

Government plots human rights overhaul to speed up deportations

Caitlin Doherty

Monday 17 November 2025 04:34 EST

Labour plans to overhaul human rights laws to facilitate the deportation of foreign criminals and small boat migrants, aiming to strengthen border security.

The government intends to change how UK judges interpret the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 8 (right to family life) and Article 3 (prohibition of torture), to prevent asylum seekers from using these rights to avoid deportation.

Proposed measures include tightening family connection rules for Article 8, updating modern slavery laws, restricting illegal migrants to a single appeal route, and potentially making refugee status temporary.

Visa sanctions will be imposed on Angola, Namibia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo if they do not cooperate with the repatriation of illegal migrants.

Critics, including human rights charities, warn that these changes will punish vulnerable individuals, drive asylum seekers underground, and undermine fundamental human rights protections.

“As a resident of the Tri-Valley for over 35 years, I am opposed to reopening FCI Dublin as an ICE detention facility in our community,” said resident Dan Morley, according to CCIJ.
Organizers warn a new ICE detention hub in Dublin would worsen these conditions and further isolate mixed-status families.
The organization warns that reopening FCI Dublin would recreate the same harmful conditions that led to the facility’s closure.","DUBLIN, CA – Dublin residents and immigrant justice advocates are urging the Dublin City Council to reject any attempt to reopen the former Federal Correctional Institution Dublin as an immigration detention center, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice (CCIJ).

Community members are expected to gather for a vigil outside the Dublin Civic Center at 6:30 p.m. on Nov. 18 before giving public comment at the council meeting at 7 p.m.

CCIJ reports that early 2025 filings revealed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is considering reopening FCI Dublin to expand immigration detention, alarming survivors and advocates because of the facility’s documented history of widespread staff sexual abuse.

The organization notes that FCI Dublin was closed in 2024 after federal investigations confirmed ongoing patterns of correctional officers sexually assaulting incarcerated women. Many survivors were undocumented, which advocates argue made them more vulnerable to threats of deportation.

“These guards abused us because we were immigrants. They told us they could do whatever they wanted, because we were going to be deported,” said one anonymous survivor. According to CCIJ, she reported being regularly subjected to racist slurs and told to “go back” to her country.

CCIJ reports that survivors also described dangerous conditions inside the facility, including mold, asbestos and deteriorating infrastructure, which contributed to the prison’s closure.

Community opposition has grown across the Tri-Valley as residents continue urging officials to block ICE from reopening a site associated with severe human rights violations, according to the organization.

CCIJ warns that reopening the facility under the Trump administration could escalate mass deportation efforts, widen arrest dragnets and increase the risk of wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens. The group adds that detention and deportation have long-term effects on family stability, mental health and industries dependent on immigrant labor.

“As a resident of the Tri-Valley for over 35 years, I am opposed to reopening FCI Dublin as an ICE detention facility in our community,” said resident Dan Morley, according to CCIJ. He stated that reopening the site would “stoke fear in the daily lives of so many of our immigrant neighbors.”

CCIJ claims that the Nov. 18 actions are part of a broader movement led by the ICE Out of Dublin Coalition, the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity and other community partners working to stop the facility from reopening. The coalition includes survivors, faith leaders, residents, labor groups and civil rights organizations.

The organization argues that FCI Dublin’s legacy as a site of systemic abuse makes it especially inappropriate for detaining immigrants. CCIJ emphasizes that many survivors still live in the Bay Area and continue to experience trauma tied to the facility.

CCIJ reports that unsafe infrastructure, toxic materials and deteriorating buildings would require major investment to make the prison habitable, raising further concerns about holding vulnerable individuals there.

The coalition fears reopening the facility would heighten fear among immigrant communities already worried about workplace raids, surveillance and traffic-stop enforcement, according to CCIJ. Organizers warn a new ICE detention hub in Dublin would worsen these conditions and further isolate mixed-status families.

CCIJ reiterates that faith leaders throughout the East Bay have joined the opposition because they believe the use of a site known for abuse violates core religious values.

The organization warns that reopening FCI Dublin would recreate the same harmful conditions that led to the facility’s closure.

According to CCIJ, while the City Council cannot directly prevent federal authorities from leasing the prison, large-scale public opposition could influence political decisions and pressure federal officials to abandon the plan.

CCIJ concludes that organizing will continue until ICE publicly commits to not reopening the facility, and they encourage residents to attend the vigil, speak during public comment and urge elected leaders to oppose detention expansion at the site.

In a statement on their Facebook page, Northfield Police Chief Jeff Schroepfer stated that ICE had not contacted the department before the incident. Furthermore, while Northfield Officers were called to the scene by bystanders, it is not a Northfield Police Department case or investigation. “The department was not involved in the contact or any related arrests and has not been provided details regarding the circumstances or reasons for ICE’s actions.”

The police chief noted that it is the policy of the Northfield Police Department not to participate in or assist with immigration enforcement actions and that they do not have the authority to interject themselves into a federal investigation.

Will be working in the coming days to gather and provide any additional as we have it, and will update you on-air and online.

Statements from Local Leaders:

Northfield Mayor Erica Zweifel:

I have viewed the video circulating showing federal agents detaining one of our neighbors in Northfield. These actions have traumatized the community and left a family without their father and husband. The City of Northfield values the safety and well-being of all residents. We value our local law enforcement officials. Our focus at the City level remains on fostering a safe, inclusive community for all residents, ensuring local law enforcement operates transparently and professionally, and providing support for families affected by incidents within our jurisdiction.

Because this is a Federal matter, the City has no authority to intervene in or direct ICE actions, and there are no local mechanisms to require identification or prevent the use of masks by Federal agents acting under Federal authority. Any questions regarding the procedures or accountability of ICE agents should be directed to the agency itself. To be clear, this is not a Northfield Police Department investigation, and the department had no role in the detention or any enforcement actions. Local law enforcement and city officials do not have authority over Federal investigations or the actions of Federal agents. I support the Northfield Police Department in fulfilling its duties responsibly and in accordance with the law.

That said, it would be irresponsible for us not to express some concern about the approach the current Federal administration is taking regarding the freedoms and civil rights that every resident of our community deserves. We fully acknowledge that we do not know the complete circumstances around the current issue at hand. However, we are fully committed to the U.S. Constitution and the laws of our land which include due process and protection under the Bill of Rights.

We call on our Federal leaders in Congress, in the White House and in the Supreme Court to uphold their oaths to the Constitution while ensuring that everyone on U.S. soil is afforded the human and civil rights that we would all want for ourselves.

Many residents have asked what they can do in the face of such uncertainty. I have reached out to Senator Tina Smith, Senator Amy Klobuchar, and Representative Angie Craig to express my deep concern about how this incident unfolded in Northfield and the delay of information regarding this community member’s location, status, or charges. Issues of transparency, oversight, and communication fall squarely within federal authority, and I am urging our congressional delegation to seek answers on behalf of the community. I encourage residents to join me in sharing these concerns with their federal representatives.

In Northfield we will continue to support one another, stay in dialogue with our local police, and engage with our elected officials. The Community Action Center has established the Northfield Supporting Neighbors Fund, donations can be made at www.northfieldsupportingneighbors.org These funds are made available to families in need for legal assistance.

Together, we can stand with this family and uphold the values of care, dignity, and accountability that define Northfielders.

State Representative Kristi Pursell (DFL-Northfield)

Yesterday’s actions by federal law enforcement were unnecessarily extreme. The disappearing of one of our community’s valued Northfielders has left us scared and angry, but we are not deterred.

I’ve been in touch with his family, community groups, and local leaders to offer my support in any way I can as we respond to this unconstitutional act. Right now we are united as a community in grieving, but we will move forward together. We must continue to speak up and speak out against unconstitutional actions like these.",https://i0.wp.com/kymnradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/KYMN_square.png?fit=32%2C25&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:09.971796

The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.

“It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process.","Activist groups and community members gathered Saturday morning to denounce the construction of a new federal immigration enforcement detention facility on Milwaukee’s Northwest Side. Renovations at the property, located at 11900 W Lake Park Drive, were clearly underway, with construction equipment sitting behind new fencing, piles of dirt and stacks of building materials visible through the building’s dark windows. Outside, protesters marched in the street and delivered speeches.

The 36,000-square-foot detention and processing center is planned to serve as a central hub for southeastern Wisconsin, holding people before deportation or transfer to other detention centers.

“You may be here, but you are not welcome here,” said Ald. Larresa Taylor — who represents the district where the facility will be located. Although the city cannot prevent ICE from taking over the facility, Taylor said that this “doesn’t mean that we are going to accept it laying down.”

Activists from Voces de la Frontera, Comité Sin Fronteras, the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Never Again Action–Wisconsin, the Party for Socialism & Liberation, and the Wisconsin Coalition for Justice in Palestine picketed outside the building for close to two hours. Towards the end of the event, a drone was seen flying overhead, which was not operated by any of the activist groups who held the rally. In a empty parking lot nearby, several deputies appeared to be packing away equipment in the trunk a Milwaukee County Sheriff’s vehicle. The Sheriff’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment on whether its drone team was flying over the Saturday protest.

Opponents of the facility say that its opening moved forward without community input or consent, and that it will perpetuate troubling uses of force and arrests in cities nationwide including Chicago. The facility will be used to process ICE detainees, as well as immigrants who must come in for regular check-ins.

Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, applauded Taylor, calling her “the first person to sound the alarm months ago about the expansion of this detention center, and to call attention and condemn what was happening in our city.” The building is privately owned by Milwaukee Governmental LLC, which originally requested modifications to the property (something Taylor learned about in December). The LLC is linked to the Illinois-based WD Schorsch LLC, which owns properties leased to federal government agencies.

“It’s not an accident what is happening, where this facility is being chosen to be built,” said Neumann-Ortiz. “It’s part of a long-term pattern of discrimination and marginalization, and criminalization of working class people of color.” Neumann-Oritz said that instead of spending “millions” on the facility, “that money should be used to pay for FoodShare, BadgerCare, and our public schools.”

Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), said, “We are not free, until we are all free.” Lang added that Black communities “know what it’s like to be ripped away from our families and locked away,” and that people are concerned about federal agents’ behavior in cities like Chicago. “And we have been worried for months, if not years, ‘is this going to happen to Milwaukee?’”

Over recent months months, videos have suggested an escalating patter of force from federal agents including shooting people in the head with pepper balls, placing protesters in chokeholds, deploying tear gas in crowded neighborhoods in broad daylight, arresting and attacking journalists, arresting parents in front of their children, and having unprofessional verbal exchanges with citizens.

Although Milwaukee hasn’t seen protest-related clashes, ICE stirred anxiety and condemnation earlier this year after arresting members of families with mixed-immigration status at the Milwaukee County Courthouse as they attended court hearings. Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was also arrested and criminally charged after the federal government accused her of attempting to hide a person sought by ICE who’d attended a hearing in her courtroom. Dugan is expected to go to trial in federal court in December. Other high profile arrests and deportations of community members have also occurred in Milwaukee during the first six months of the second Trump administration.

Conor Mika, a student activist at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) condemned what he said is a lack of transparency and accountability for his school’s relationship with ICE, which has been using a university building for operations in Milwaukee. “It’s time MSOE takes a stand. It’s on MSOE to slow down ICE’s operations, and protect its students by removing ICE from this building, and refusing any future collaborations with these agencies conducting mass deportations in our city.”

Leah Janke and Tanya Brown both attended the rally Saturday, and told the Wisconsin Examiner that it was important to make their voices heard. “I think it’s important that people here know that we don’t want this,” said Brown. “It’s not just a small community that doesn’t want it, it’s everybody. We don’t want it.” Janke said. “It’s 2025, and this is completely unacceptable to be running an ICE facility like this, and be deporting people illegally, without due process. This is insanity. It doesn’t feel right in any way.” Janke added, “I’ve seen a lot happening in Chicago, and that’s my fear…that’s my biggest fear.”

Besides attending rallies, Janke has been making “whistle kits” filled with whistles and information about reporting ICE, or alerting the community if an arrest is happening. “Be safe out there,” said Janke. “Because honestly, it’s scary and people are getting hurt.”

Raúl Ríos, an activist with both Comité Sin Fronteras and Party for Socialism and Liberation, said it was important to rally people on Saturday both on the North and South Sides of Milwaukee, especially since the city is one of the most segregated in America. “Most people that I’ve heard, not only today but previously, had said that they had no idea that this was even being constructed, and that it’s going to be used as the main facility for southeast Wisconsin,” Rios told the Examiner.",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0106-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:34.932820

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.
The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.
Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.
Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""","The changes aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals, as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

She said the ""pace and scale"" had been destabilising and that to ""maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control"".

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year. The government sees overhauling the system as crucial in order to rebuild public confidence that it can stem the numbers coming to the UK.

Under the plans, which have been criticised by some Labour MPs as well as opposition parties, people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will argue that these restrictions would give room to create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

Tighter restrictions would be placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years - and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

Housing and weekly allowances - either £9.95 a week for those whose food is provided or £49.18 a week for those in self-catered accommodation - will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

The home secretary is also expected to announce another Danish-inspired move, which is to take possessions and savings to pay for accommodation, including cars and e-bikes - although unlike in Denmark this will not include jewellery and sentimental items like wedding rings.

The Home Office says this is because some asylum seekers are getting gifts of money from relatives at the same time as living in free accommodation and receiving a small financial allowance from the UK government.

Mahmood also wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied - only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

And the UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

As first reported in the Times, the threat of visa bans for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Ahead of Mahmood's statement to MPs, the prime minister's official spokesman denied that the government was ""chasing hard-right voters"".

Asked whether the government was ""talking the language of Reform"", he added: ""No, we are talking the language of dealing with an asylum system that is in chaos.""

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the plans were ""a small step in the right direction"" and her party would work with the government to get them through Parliament.

However, she added that the proposals were ""nowhere near enough"" and called on the government to go further, including by leaving the ECHR and removing everyone who arrives in the country illegally.

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including the MP for Folkestone Tony Vaughn, who said he agreed action needed to be taken ""to regain public trust"" in the asylum system but opposed the idea of temporary asylum ""on principle"".

""A particular problem that I have is around the idea we should be trying to kick refugees out despite having granted them protection,"" Vaughn, who is an immigration barrister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""I think the idea is we review their status after two-and-a-half years on a rolling basis and then hopefully at some point their country will be safe and we can deport them - I think that's completely the wrong position in principle.""

Vaughn said the proposals risked creating ""limbo and alienation"" and called on the government to instead clear the asylum appeals backlog, make decisions on claims more quickly, and ramp up the France-UK returns deal pilot.

Speaking on the same programme, Asylum and Border Security Minister Alex Norris said the 20-year rule would only apply to new arrivals, but he said he did want to tackle the 50% of refugees who ""end up on benefits"".

Norris said: ""If your intention is to come to this country illegally... sit at home, not contribute, not learn English, integrate into the community, not to build a life... then that's going to come with much greater checks.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cdcf/live/51572e20-c385-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:14.414601

Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the effort launched on Saturday is to protect the public from “dangerous criminal offenders who are in the country unlawfully,” adding that additional DHS workers were deployed to Charlotte.

Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents in a similar effort in Chicago, said that 81 arrests were made Sunday.

Nearly 1,400 ICE detainers across North Carolina have not been honored — releasing “criminal illegal aliens” into North Carolina’s neighborhoods, DHS said Saturday.

Some of the arrests and agent encounters were caught on video — with many shocking audiences.

On Sunday, ICE officials said the driver of a van went off-road, driving around agents in Charlotte in the University City area near UNC-Charlotte.

DHS officials said an officer was injured when the van driver — a U.S. citizen — led them on a high-speed chase and later tried to ram law enforcement vehicles.

When the driver was arrested, a firearm was found in the vehicle, according to DHS.

Also on Sunday, a video sent from a WJZY viewer showed about a dozen agents out in northeast Charlotte just before noon, with a large crowd around the agents.

Some people were recording video and others were annoyed by the agents at the Compare Foods grocery store near the intersection of Sugar Creek Road and Tryon Street in Charlotte.

An early sighting of agents Saturday was near Baleada Bar and Grill, less than a mile from where a group of agents was caught on video getting into two unmarked Ford SUVs along South Boulevard.

There were tense moments as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents smashed the window of a Honduran-born U.S. citizen in a Charlotte strip mall parking lot.

Willy Aceituno recorded video of the second stop when his red Ford pickup truck window was smashed. He says once the video cut away — the agents dragged him out and threw him to the ground.

Aceituno was released once he was able to show documentation that he was a U.S. citizen. But he was also shaken up with some cuts to his arms from the broken glass and he later filed a report with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police.

The incident with Aceituno was also caught on video from another angle, showing the agents holding him to the ground.

The agents drove off in a light-colored unmarked Ford Expedition SUV.

A video captured by a man driving in a parking lot also showed U.S. agents with two people on the ground across the street. Johny Martinez Gonzalez cursed at the agents on video as they led the pair of detainees away.

Also Saturday, a video showed federal agents putting a woman’s hands behind her back as she can be heard yelling.

Video captured by Paula Walker Coleman showed the woman screaming, “I am a US citizen!”

According to WUNC, agents were seen making arrests in “Charlotte’s immigrant-heavy Central Avenue and South Boulevard corridors.”

Also Saturday, U.S. Border Patrol agents were seen roaming an east Charlotte neighborhood in a dark-colored unmarked minivan.

Video showed masked agents approaching two men using a ladder to hang Christmas lights in a front yard.

One agent tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, homeowner Rheba Hamilton said. The workers did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

Also Saturday, a detention was caught on video.

Border Patrol agents were spotted arresting a man at an immigrant shopping center in east Charlotte around 10:15 a.m. Saturday.

The man was grabbed at the corner of Rosehaven Drive and Central Avenue, according to WFAE. Agents chased the man into a laundromat, then take him into custody, according to WFAE which captured the video.

Meanwhile, a bakery in Charlotte decided to close indefinitely while the ICE crackdown was underway.

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

Manolo Betancur owns Manolo’s Bakery — a popular Latin bakery in East Charlotte — said he decided to close after watching raids in the parking lot Saturday.

“I have seen these people in SUVs, cars that are not marked with their faces covered — throwing immigrants to the floor and taking them away,” Betancur said.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/11/video-ice.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-17 11:00:43.438204

Earlier this month, District Judge Karin Immergut ruled in favor of Oregon and found that Trump exceeded his authority by deploying hundreds of Oregon and California National Guard troops to, in part, protect federal staff and property at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in South Portland.

""The court acknowledged large-scale violent protests in June, but treated them as irrelevant to the President's determination just a few months later,"" the federal government wrote in its motion.

PAST COVERAGE | Trump administration appeals court ruling blocking troop deployment to Portland

On Saturday, the number of Oregon National Guard troops remaining on standby to deploy was reduced to 100, according to ABC News.

The troops are scheduled to remain under federal control until Nov. 26, ""but the Department of War intends to extend this mobilization,"" according to the federal government's newest court filing.

In its new motion to stay the district court ruling, the Trump administration argued that in mid-June, approximately 450 protesters engaged in activities such as starting fires, assaulting officers, blocking traffic, and vandalizing the ICE facility.

The protests and demonstrations, according to the appeal, made it difficult to carry out immigration laws.

The appeal says the Department of Homeland Security sought assistance from the Department of War to safeguard federal personnel and facilities in Oregon, and President Trump granted the request, directing the federalization of a small number of Oregon National Guard members.

The administration claims that the President's determination was lawful under laws that allow federalization when regular forces are unable to execute U.S. laws or when there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion.

However, the district court's ruling, presided over by Judge Karin J. Immergut, permanently barred the administration from deploying troops to Portland, stating that the ""facts on the ground"" showed the protests did not prevent federal agents from carrying out immigration laws and their duties.

Portland Police only designated a gathering at the ICE facility as a riot on one occasion this summer, in June.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield responded to the administration's appeal on Friday, stating, ""The district court’s ruling made it clear that this administration must be accountable to the truth and to the rule of law."" Rayfield's office has not yet responded to the Trump administration's motion to stay.

And last week, Lewis & Clark College law professor Tung Yin commented on the ruling, saying, ""It's not that they can't win an appeal, but they would have to get a legal rule that essentially says, the president's determination is conclusive when the president says, my people can't enforce federal law.""

The Trump administration is requesting an administrative stay by Nov. 21 to prevent the defederalization of Oregon Guard members, citing harms and alteration of the status quo caused by the injunction. The appeal contends that threats against federal officials are often crimes and that officials cannot know in advance which threats will materialize.",https://kfoxtv.com/resources/media/1583f77f-2d26-431a-8e45-c2ead2d0f231-ICEPortlandDMorrison_21.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:56:46.078916

He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” he explained.
“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said.
As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer.
KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.","A 45-year-old Riverside County man, who reportedly works as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, is accused of illegally detaining a minor at gunpoint while off duty last week.

The Nov. 10 incident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, played out at around 10:30 pm outside a home in the 32000 block of Daybrook Terrance in Temecula.

Lawyer Greg Kirakosian, who represents the boy and his family, told KTLA that the 17-year-old was driving home after dropping a friend off down the street when he saw the suspect, identified by investigators as Gerardo Rodriguez, pointing a gun at his vehicle, demanding he pull over.

“In the moment, I think he was just scared for his life. He had a gun pulled on him, and he was told to immediately stop or else,” he explained. “Then that same person came up to his driver’s side door and pulled him out at gunpoint.”

In footage of the incident obtained by KTLA, the 45-year-old is seen pulling a gun from his waistband as he walked up the street, pointing it at the teen’s truck and demanding he stop the vehicle while reportedly brandishing his badge.

“Freeze, police,” Rodriguez shouts. “Put the car in f****** park. Get out of the car. Turn it off, get out. You’re speeding in the f****** neighborhood. Come over here, sit down, get your a** down. You have a driver’s license?”

The 45-year-old, who is known to residents on the street as an ICE agent and also reportedly told the boy he worked for ICE, then began interrogating the Mexican American teen, asking him who he was, where he is from and demanding documentation, eventually drawing the attention of others who live on the street.

“By the time our client’s parents showed up, the neighbors had essentially come to the rescue and stopped him from doing what he was doing, calming him down and forcing him to go back inside his house and leaving the boy alone,” Kirakosian said.

The teenager’s parents had been alerted by a friend to what was happening, prompting them to rush over from their home with their son’s passport, fearing the incident could be some type of immigrant enforcement operation. They called 911 after they arrived.

Responding deputies turned the investigation over to RCSD’s Investigation Bureau, who contacted Rodriguez later that same night, arrested him and conducted a search of his house “where evidence related to the investigation was collected,” the department said in a news release.

“I think right now a lot of Mexican Americans, whether they are in a situation like this or not, who are angry upset and scared and this just really came close to home for them,” Kirakosian said when asked how the family was doing after the harrowing ordeal.

The L.A.-based civil rights attorney added that he believes the 45-year-old has become emboldened by what he does and sees other ICE agents doing on a day-to-day basis.

“It’s gotten so bad where he thinks he can now turn his own block into his personal ICE checkpoint,” Kirakosian said. “I don’t know how much worse the situation is going to get, honestly. This kid could’ve been shot.”

This incident comes after several others where federal law enforcement agents have pulled their firearms on citizens.

On Nov. 9, video captured a ICE officer pointing his gun at a woman behind him in an intersection in Santa Ana, which was witnessed by a Fullerton police officer returning from the Santa Ana Jail facility, who refused to get involved if no crime had been committed.

Federal officials later claimed the woman was following the agent.

On Oct. 30, a 24-year-old Ontario man was shot by a federal agent who was reportedly trying to notify officers involved in an enforcement operation that there were children across the street.

In that instance, federal officials claimed the agent fired “defensive shots” while fearing the 24-year-old was attempting to run over officers.

As for this latest incident, Rodriguez was booked into the Cois Byrd Detention Center for assault with a deadly weapon, child endangerment and assault by a public officer. Jail records show he posted bond and was released the same night.

KTLA has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.

Neither juvenile nor his parents have been publicly identified by authorities.

Authorities said the investigation remains ongoing and that anyone with information is asked to contact Investigator Alyssa Morris at the Southwest Sheriff’s Station by calling 951-696-3000.",https://ktla.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Gerardo-Rodriguez-Featured.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:47.624910

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it,” and for the last decade the battle over immigration has been turbocharged. Now’s the time to step back and realize this isn’t a so much contest between how many immigrants the country wants or needs or the cultural impacts of mass migration so much as an issue of control of immigration. But under the Constitution, Congress, accountable to the voters, ultimately controls.

“Control Is a Tough Nut”

The newly installed Pope, Leo XIV, was recently asked to name his favorite movies.

Of the four he named, three were what you would expect the pontiff to enjoy: The Sound of Music (1965), a semibiographical account of a novice nun who leaves the cloister to care for a large, motherless family; It’s a Wonderful Life (1946), a tale of despair, self-sacrifice, and redemption; and Life Is Beautiful (1997), a story about a father who “uses a perfect mixture of will, humor and imagination to protect his son from the dangers around” the concentration camp to which they’ve been sent.

The fourth, however, is telling: Ordinary People (1980). If you’ve never seen it, the IMDb summary tells you all you need to know: “The accidental death of the older son of an affluent family deeply strains the relationships among the bitter mother, the good-natured father and the guilt-ridden younger son.”

It’s dark, and even the “happy” ending leaves little resolution as the mother (Beth Jarret, played by Mary Tyler Moore), leaves the son, Conrad (Timothy Hutton), and father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland) just when Conrad accepts that he’s not to blame for his brother’s death.

That it beat Raging Bull for the best picture Oscar tells you more about America pre-Reagan than it does about artistic merit, but in any event, the whole movie is about control: Beth can’t accept that fate derailed her overweening efforts to create the perfect family, and responds by trying to control her husband and son.

The story begins after Conrad attempts suicide, and his parents send him to a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch). Berger eventually gains Conrad’s trust and tells the doctor he wants to be “more in control”. Berger admits that he’s “not big on control”, but agrees to help because “control is a tough nut”.

That the spiritual leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics would “enjoy” a grueling, quarter-century-old flick about the challenges of control says much about the burdens of the papacy but also a lot about the world outside of the Vatican’s walls.

Because much of our current angst stems from a belief that we are increasingly losing control.

Few can understand, let alone control, AI; it promises incomparable change, but we don’t know whether it will be calamity (The Terminator) or some form of salvation (Interstellar).

AI is also driving stock markets, but is it a bubble or a boom? Having lived through downturns in 1987, 2000, and 2008, I have my thoughts, but regardless, it’s the difference between eating chateaubriand at retirement or roasting squirrels over a trash-can fire, though there’s little we can do to control it.

Why are Democratic Socialists like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on the ascent even though we all know how socialism ends? Because Gotham is the most chaotic place in the world, both good and bad, and he promised to control it in favor of the proletariat.

Or consider Covid, when billions sacrificed their liberties for what they were told was the common good. “Covid Karens” who snitched on those who broke nonsensical rules were the spiritual heirs to the hundreds of thousands of East German civilians who were “occasional” Stasi informants, in that while neither could control their government, at least they could control their neighbors.

Shifting Fronts in the Battle over Control of Immigration

Then, there’s immigration.

The battle for control over the subject has stirred up popular resentment in the Western world, with clashes following the “Unite the Kingdom” march in London in September and hundreds of thousands taking to German streets to protest a proposed bill to crack down on illegal migrants in February.

Each is a physical manifestation of a political opinion — both for and against immigration — in the face of a government and “elite” that doesn’t share the protesters’ views — in other words, a battle for control.

The First Trump Term

Nowhere, however, have the fronts in that battle shifted as they have in the United States since Donald Trump descended the golden escalator at his eponymous NYC tower on June 16, 2015, to announce his campaign for the 2016 presidential election.

In a seemingly unscripted address that day, he attacked one of his Republican opponents, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R), as “weak on immigration”, promised to end President Obama’s “illegal executive order on immigration” (DACA), asked “when do we beat Mexico at the border?”, and vowed to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and “have Mexico pay for that wall”.

Trump’s campaign was derided as a ”publicity stunt” until his opponents realized — too late — he was serious, but more importantly that he had tapped into a desire by Americans to control immigration.

His rhetoric alone quickly triggered a “Trump effect”, with an initial downturn in illegal entries at the Southwest border once he took office and a slowing of new migration over his first term.

The cartels and smugglers quickly reasserted control, however, as waves of illegal migrants (mostly families) exploited loopholes the new president was powerless to fix without congressional help, and immigrant advocates vied for control using the courts to stymie Trump’s immigration and border policies.

Trump, likely to his detriment, failed to highlight his immigration successes on the 2020 presidential campaign trail, even as a largely supine media echoed claims by his opponent, Joe Biden, that the incumbent “separated children from their parents at the border”.

“Biden’s Border Fiasco”

Once Biden took over, the gains of Trump I were lost, as the border descended into disaster in response to the new president’s “catch-and-release” policies and major cities began falling off fiscal cliffs in an effort to accommodate hundreds of thousands of improperly released migrants.

Biden’s supporters in the press downplayed the burgeoning migrant tsunami and did their candidate no favors once the sheer magnitude of the surge made its way into the public sphere. By August 2022, the editors at Bloomberg Opinion were warning that “Biden’s Border Fiasco Is Expanding”, while calling for “leadership” on the issue.

That leadership never appeared, and a last-ditch effort to blame Trump’s opposition to a deeply flawed and poorly understood 2024 “Senate border bill” fell on the deaf ears of an electorate that wanted control of the border, to the degree it became increasingly dour on “immigration” itself.

Trump redux found his old immigration script, and though Democratic party elites swapped Biden for his Vice President, Kamala Harris, as their 2024 presidential candidate, Harris couldn’t escape the stigma of having been the president’s “border czar”.

“Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration”

Consequently, as a New York Times headline the day after the 2024 election explained: “Voters Were Fed Up Over Immigration. They Voted for Trump.”

In other words, the electorate wanted control over the entry and removal of aliens in the United States, and when they didn’t get it from one side, they picked the other.

The Trump II administration has viewed the election as a mandate to undo the harm of the Biden years by answering “mass migration” with “mass deportations”.

That has required a huge influx of additional manpower and detention resources for ICE and CBP, which Congress provided in H.R. 1, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act”.

It has also prompted a reassessment of whether aliens who entered illegally but are present in the United States are eligible for bond.

Trump’s DHS has pointed to the detention mandates for alien “applicants for admission”, i.e., aliens who haven’t been formally admitted, in section 235(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) in concluding illegal entrants present here cannot be released on bond, and DOJ’s appellate immigration tribunal, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) has agreed.

Immigrants and their advocates have pushed back against that interpretation in demanding bond release hearings, and as Politico reported on October 31, “More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that” the administration’s interpretation of the law is in error.

You can add Judge Jeffrey Cummings of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois to that list. In a November 13 order, he directed the government to release 615 aliens who were detained during DHS’s Chicago-area “Operation Midway Blitz” on bond under a different provision, section 236(a), of the INA.

Advocates’ efforts to retake control of the immigration issue through the courts harken back to Trump I, with the differences being (1) Trump II has “flooded the zone” by engaging in different enforcement efforts in various ways, and (2) this time around, Trump rolled out his initiatives quickly, giving his DOJ time to seek judicial review (Judge Cummings’ order is on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, for example).

The Protestors’ Veto

But not all of the opposition has involved legal niceties. Protestors countered Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts more directly, impeding ICE from arresting aliens by blocking immigration facilities, ramming federal vehicles, and (allegedly) doxxing officers. DHS claims there’s been an 8,000 percent increase in death threats against ICE, and a tenfold increase in assaults.

I’ve omitted the assassination attempts at immigration facilities in Dallas, Alvarado, and McAllen, all in Texas.

The protestors’ implicit argument isn’t that certain aliens should be protected from deportation, but that no alien should be removed, so long as they have made it here.

On November 12, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) joined that chorus, issuing a “Special Message” on immigration, which stated: “We oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people.”

To say many of the factual assertions they make in that message, including their plaints about “the conditions in detention centers and the lack of access to pastoral care” and “that some immigrants in the United States have arbitrarily lost their legal status”, beg the question would be an understatement. The letter is replete with talking points, not facts, and many are questionable if not wrong.

Regardless, it raises the question of how the bishops think the Trump administration should respond to the millions of aliens who came here illegally between 2021 and January 20, 2025.

The bishops make clear that they “advocate for a meaningful reform of our nation’s immigration laws and procedures” (read: “amnesty”), but they never say what they would reform, how that reform would work, or whom they would allow to stay.

In any event, if amnesty were popular, it would have happened under Obama when Democrats held the House and White House and had a supermajority in the Senate. It’s beyond a non-starter after the past four years of non-enforcement.

And while the bishops “recognize that nations have a responsibility to regulate their borders and establish a just and orderly immigration system for the sake of the common good”, they never explain how the United States can fulfill that obligation without deporting those here illegally.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Capitol-social.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 03:56:19.817261

Clergy representing Catholic, Jewish, Episcopal and interfaith coalitions gathered Friday morning to demand an end to workplace raids and mass detentions. The protest escalated when officers ordered the group to disperse; several faith leaders refused, kneeling in the street in prayer before being taken into custody, according to Reuters. Organizers say at least one of the arrestees was a 72-year-old priest who has participated in immigration vigils for more than a decade.

The arrests come just weeks after a separate incident in Chicago in which a Methodist minister was struck in the head by a pepper-ball projectile during a police response to a protest outside a migrant intake center. Earlier this fall, a group of faith leaders including priests and nuns were detained after being refused admission inside to administer communion, an essential element of a Catholic’s faith life. Immigrant-rights groups say the pattern reflects a broader escalation in the policing of clergy-led actions, many of which have historically been peaceful.

Legal experts note that faith-led protests often invoke First Amendment protections for both free exercise of religion and free assembly, making these clashes particularly sensitive. While authorities argue that restrictions are tied to safety and facility security, civil liberties groups warn that aggressive enforcement, especially when directed at clergy, can have a chilling effect on religious and political expression.

ICE officials said the Broadview arrests occurred only after “multiple lawful orders were ignored.” Organizers counter that civil disobedience is central to their mission and vowed to continue holding weekly vigils outside the facility, calling the arrests a sign that we are in “a spiritual emergency.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2235816386.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:54.801252

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday announced Operation Southern Spear, aimed at what he calls ""narco-terrorists"" who are allegedly bringing illegal drugs into the country. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Saturday also announced it was launching Operation Charlotte's Web — matching the name of the classic children's book — in Charlotte, N.C., to target undocumented immigrants.

""There is no parent who has read Charlotte's Web to a child who cannot be outraged by this,"" Dan Shapiro, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Israel from 2011 to 2017, wrote on X.

Asked about the inspiration for the operation name and the message the agency wants to send by using it, DHS responded to NPR with a press release about the operation that included a statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" McLaughlin said in the statement. ""There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens. President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't.""

NPR also reached out to the Defense Department for comment but has not received a response.

Here is what to know about military operation names.

Naming military operations is not new. Neither is criticism of names

Code names for U.S. military operations date back to the World War II era and began for security reasons, according to Lt. Col. Gregory C. Sieminski in the article ""The Art of Naming Operations,"" in The US Army War College Quarterly: Parameters. The names were based on colors at first, such as Operation Indigo, but as World War II spread, military officials switched to a name-based system that included projects and locations.

After the Vietnam War, military officials started using a computer system to reconcile nicknames and code words, called the Code Word, Nickname, and Exercise Term System, or NICKA.

Routine military exercises use the NICKA system for naming operations, according to Mark Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Highly visible operations generally get two-word names chosen outside the system, such as operations Just Cause in Panama, Iraqi Freedom, and Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Cancian told NPR.

""The ones that are chosen are chosen for a reason to project a message,"" Cancian told NPR. ""So, going back to Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, the message is freedom. With the recent ones, Midnight Hammer and Southern Spear, the message is lethality.""

Although DHS is not considered part of the U.S. military, using the name ""Charlotte's Web"" could also have been chosen because ""you've got the spider's web that catches people,"" but it could also be the administration trying to be ""tongue in cheek,"" he continued.

And other military operations have received backlash and criticism in the past, including what is now known as Operation Enduring Freedom. It was first called Operation Infinite Justice, but was changed after backlash that it was offensive to Muslims.

""The fact that these names get scrutiny is not unusual,"" Cancian said. ""Now, I think in this case, given the administration's aggressive rhetoric, I think that inspires maybe pushback, but it's not unusual that names get a lot of scrutiny.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x576+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2F23%2Fa86dcca248fc8f30447dbf9531f4%2Fgettyimages-2244880522.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:57.365321

Mahmood's torrent of new policy announcements in recent days are certainly bold - from limiting refugees to temporary stays, to overhauling human rights law to help increase deportations, and threatening countries with visa bans unless they accept the return of criminals and illegal immigrants.

But the plans are controversial too. The Refugee Council, which supports asylum-seekers, says making refugee status temporary is both ""highly impractical"" as well as ""inhumane"".

The home secretary's team are delighted at the newspaper headlines and TV coverage their announcements have secured in recent days, yet they know that was the easy bit.

Persuading Labour MPs from all wings of the party to vote en masse for the plans is a far bigger challenge.

Backbench frustration over winter fuel payments and welfare reform led to embarrassing government U-turns. Will restive Labour MPs try to shift government policy yet again?

That may depend on whether a politician's constituency is under threat from Reform UK and Conservatives on the right, or the Liberal Democrats and Greens on the left.

Some ministers are already raising concerns about Mahmood's proposals in private, and sceptical MPs have started to speak out in public.

Rachael Maskell, a prominent critic of the government's botched welfare reforms, told me many of her colleagues are ""seriously concerned"".

She said the government is going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration and its plans to change how human rights law is applied in the UK are a ""step too far"".

Another sceptical Labour MP, Brian Leishman, told me he had ""big reservations"" about the proposals, and cautioned ministers against ""trying to copy Farage and Reform who only want to demonise people"".

To minimise the prospect of parliamentary opposition, Mahmood has been meeting groups of Labour MPs in recent weeks to make what her allies call ""the persuasive moral case for reform"".

But privately they concede that it will be a difficult balance.

Partly because many in Labour are uncomfortable with both these policies and the accompanying rhetoric.

Both the Conservatives and Reform can sense those tensions and both are trying to capitalise on them.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage even put out a statement to say something he knows Labour MPs won't like - ""The home secretary sounds like a Reform supporter"".

Farage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch both doubt these plans will even get through the Commons.

The government is billing these changes as the most significant reforms to the asylum system since World War Two.

Oxford University's Migration Observatory says Mahmood's overhaul will make the UK's immigration system amongst the strictest countries in Europe.

But that doesn't mean the number of small boat arrivals will come down.

""This won't be the silver bullet and I think the government recognises that"", argues Dr Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the organisation.

""It is taking a broader approach, focusing on enforcement and return deals. Will people know about restrictions enough to deter them? We will have to wait and see.""

Reducing ""pull"" factors and making the UK less attractive to migrants is a massive long-term battle.

In this fight the government is up against sophisticated people-smuggling gangs who have shown they can adapt fast.

The home secretary will be hoping her ""throw the kitchen sink at it"" approach gradually reduces arrivals and increases deportations.

Mahmood believes community cohesion across the country depends on it.

But so does her future and that of her government.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/04d7/live/88733380-c395-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 04:58:44.172718

Many of those arrested have reported encountering Vietnamese officials inside jails or immigration detention facilities and during check-in meetings with Thai immigration authorities.
Vietnamese Authorities Harassing Refugees in Thailand Several Hmong and Montagnard refugees who were held in Thai immigration detention in February through May, as well as refugees who spoke with detainees held there through August, said that Thai authorities allow Vietnamese police to visit detainees.
They’ll tell the Thai police to arrest us.” In April, Vietnamese police pulled aside some Montagnard men during their check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities.
Some former detainees said that during visits to Thai detention, Vietnamese officials said that they had requested that Thai immigration authorities continue their detention until they agreed to return to Vietnam.","Increased cooperation between Thai and Vietnamese authorities is putting Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers in Thailand at heightened risk of forcible return to Vietnam, Human Rights Watch said last Friday (14 November). By facilitating Vietnamese cross-border abuses, known as transnational repression, Thai authorities are violating international refugee law protections.

Thai police have carried out several large-scale operations in 2025 detaining scores of Vietnamese nationals, many of whom are recognized by the United Nations as refugees and asylum seekers. Many of those arrested have reported encountering Vietnamese officials inside jails or immigration detention facilities and during check-in meetings with Thai immigration authorities.

“Vietnamese exiles are facing increased insecurity in Thailand,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Thai authorities should immediately stop detaining refugees and stop cooperating with Vietnamese police seeking their return.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 34 Vietnamese refugees and asylum seekers in Bangkok from July through October 2025, including 7 people previously involved in human rights activism in Vietnam, 3 relatives of current political prisoners, as well as over 20 ethnic Montagnards and Hmong facing persecution in Vietnam for their religious beliefs or involvement in protests. Nearly all have been recognized as refugees by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) or are registered with the UN as asylum seekers and are awaiting interviews to determine their status.

Most of the exiled Vietnamese interviewed said fears of arrest, abduction, or extradition to Vietnam have grown in the past two years due to increased visits by Vietnamese authorities to Thai immigration detention centers. They also cited the April 2023 abduction of dissident journalist Duong Van Thai, 42, a UNHCR-registered refugee who had fled Vietnam in 2019 and was awaiting resettlement to a third country. Unidentified men forcibly took him to Vietnam, and in late October 2024, after a closed one-day trial, a Vietnamese court sentenced him to 12 years in prison for publishing information “aimed at opposing the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.” Exiles’ apprehension increased further after Thai authorities, assisted by Vietnamese security personnel, arrested the dissident Y Quynh Bdap in June 2024. The Vietnamese government has labeled Bdap’s human rights group, Montagnards Stand for Justice, as a “terrorist” group.

In 2025, Thai police have carried out multiple operations targeting Vietnamese exiles, including in February, March, April, July, and October. Many of those arrested are ethnic Montagnards or Hmong from Vietnam’s Central Highlands, most of whom are recognized by UNHCR as refugees or asylum seekers with applications in process. Several Montagnards and Hmong detained in February through April gave consistent accounts after their release of Vietnamese police in Thai facilities pressing them to agree to return to Vietnam and later harassing them during check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities.

Many refugees said Vietnamese police had visited their relatives in Vietnam in the last year, telling them that the police had located their relatives in Thailand and were arranging to have them returned.

Several human rights groups in Thailand have interviewed detainees and released exiles who corroborate these findings and have sent private reports to UN officials with allegations about cases of abuse.

Thai police regularly detain UNHCR-recognized refugees—including from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Myanmar—and hold them until they pay a bail bond, which most refugees and immigration advocates consider to be bribes. Human Rights Watch reported in July that Thai police routinely arrest and solicit bribes from Myanmar asylum seekers and migrants. Another Human Rights Watch report documented Thai authorities assisting foreign governments to target refugees.

The Thai government is obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, or non-return, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture or other serious ill-treatment, a threat to life, or other comparable serious human rights violations. Refoulement is prohibited by the UN Convention Against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, as well as customary international law. The prohibition on refoulement is incorporated in Thailand’s 2023 Act on Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearances.

Vietnam and Thailand appear to have agreed to cooperate more closely and exchange information about Vietnamese refugees, especially those in detention, since early 2024 when the two countries began negotiating an extradition treaty. In May 2025, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Thailand’s then-Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra signed a Comprehensive Agreement in which they “agreed to enhance legislative and judicial cooperation and committed to effectively implementing signed agreements between the two countries on preventing and combating crime, transferring sentenced persons, and cooperating in the enforcement of penal sentences.”

In July, several UN human rights experts sent letters to the governments of Vietnam and Thailand requesting information about many of these cases. The UN experts stated that “[t]here are concerns that the Government of Viet Nam may be exchanging information with the Government of Thailand to identify Vietnamese Montagnard refugees in Thailand for their possible forced repatriation to Viet Nam, including those recognized as refugees by the UNHCR and being considered for resettlement in third countries.”

The experts also expressed alarm about the reported incidents of “reprisals and intimidation” against exile human rights defenders in Thailand and “the undue restrictions” imposed on diaspora organizations, which they determined were “designed to further discourage cooperation with the United Nations” and prevent people from providing information to the UN.

Countries that have previously resettled Vietnamese refugees, such as Australia, Canada, Germany, and other European states, should consider increasing their resettlement of those at serious risk, Human Rights Watch said. The US has all but suspended refugee resettlement programs, including for refugees in Thailand.

“Thailand is now cooperating and is complicit in Vietnam’s transnational repression of exiles in Thailand,” Sifton said. “Outside governments need to expedite resettlement of refugees at risk in Thailand and urge the government to prevent Vietnam’s interference in refugee cases.”

Thailand-Vietnam Cooperation, Pressure on Refugees

Immigration Raids

Thai authorities for years have carried out sweeps to detain migrants and immigrants, many of them refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar, Vietnam, and elsewhere in the region. Those arrested are typically charged for entering Thailand illegally or working without a valid visa. Asylum seekers and refugees registered with UNHCR are generally not authorized to work under Thai law.

Those arrested are usually held short term in Thai jails. Some obtain release after paying what authorities call fines, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 Thai baht (US$30 to $150) each. Detainees unable to pay or otherwise obtain release from jail are then usually transferred to immigration detention centers, where they are held until they can post a bond, typically 50,000 baht (US$1,500), and demonstrate that they have obtained a Thai guarantor. In some other cases, they are deported or later resettled as refugees to third countries.

On February 23, 2025, in Nonthaburi province, just outside Bangkok, Thai police detained over 60 Montagnard people, including several UNHCR-recognized refugees, according to witnesses and UN reporting. Most were convicted of “illegal entry and stay” and sent to jail. Detainees subsequently were placed in immigration detention centers, women with children were transferred to an immigration detention center in Bang Khen in Bangkok, while others were sent to the Suan Phlu center. Police in May also detained several other Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers in and around Bangkok.

In other raids in March, April, and July, Thai police arrested dozens of Hmong refugees and asylum seekers. Some were able to pay fines or post bail to be released, but many Hmong people detained from early 2025 remained in detention as of early November.

In a more recent operation in Nonthaburi on October 29, Thai police detained 70 Montagnards in an early morning raid. According to local sources, those detained included 42 people whom UNHCR had determined were refugees or who were awaiting processing of their asylum claims. Several had been detained in the earlier raids.

The authorities soon released 20 of them, who had previously been released on bail, and took the rest to the Suan Phlu immigration detention facility. A member of the Montagnard community in Nonthaburi said that the next day, the Thai authorities fined the remaining detainees 5,000 Thai baht (US$150) each, indicating that they would be released on payment of the fine.

Threats to Families in Vietnam

Human Rights Watch interviewed over a dozen men and two women in Thailand from the Montagnard community in Bangkok who had fled Vietnam at various times from 2015 to 2023. Several said that government officials had regularly visited the exiles’ relatives in their home districts in Vietnam’s Central Highlands in recent months and urged them to tell their exiled family members to return. A Montagnard man in his 30s said police went to his village in February and told his parents that they knew where her son was and that they should tell him to come home, saying that if he returned, “there will be less trouble.”

Some refugees said that relatives arrested during the immigration raid in Nonthaburi province in April and May told them by telephone that Thai authorities had allowed two Vietnamese police officials to interrogate them in detention soon after their arrest. The police, their relatives said, threatened several of them with forced repatriation, demanding that they sign documents in which they would agree to be returned. Some said that while they were detained, Vietnamese police visited their families in Vietnam and attempted to coerce them to convince their relatives to return.

Several Hmong refugees reported similar incidents and trends. A Hmong woman, whose husband was a leader of an unregistered Christian church and who had fled with him and the rest of their family in 2022, said the police now regularly visit her parents and parents-in-law in Vietnam.

“They came on August 1 [2025] and told them, ‘We have an agreement with the Thai police to bring him back,’” referring to her husband, who had been in Thai immigration detention. They told them, “We’re going to put him in jail for his anti-state activities.” The woman said she believed the police were suggesting that if his parents and parents-in-law helped convince her husband to return voluntarily, he would be rewarded with some leniency.

Nguyen Viet Dung, a former political prisoner convicted in 2018 for conducting “propaganda against the state,” who fled Vietnam after his release in late 2024, said that his relatives in Vietnam had faced growing intimidation. He provided multiple examples of Vietnamese police visiting his parents and sister in 2025. He expressed concern that Vietnamese authorities would seek his arrest in Thailand because he was on still on parole from his 2018 conviction when he fled Vietnam, making his departure illegal.

An asylum seeker who fled in 2023, Hoang Hao, whose brother Hoang Duc Binh is a political prisoner in Vietnam, said the authorities have frequently harassed his sister in Vietnam. He said they press her to speak with him by telephone and urge him to return, while suggesting that they will otherwise compel Thailand to have him returned. Two other Vietnamese refugees gave similar accounts.

Vietnamese Authorities Harassing Refugees in Thailand

Several Hmong and Montagnard refugees who were held in Thai immigration detention in February through May, as well as refugees who spoke with detainees held there through August, said that Thai authorities allow Vietnamese police to visit detainees. With the involvement of Thai officials, they have repeatedly sought to convince or compel detainees to sign documents agreeing to return to Vietnam, which detainees have refused. And in March 2024, several Montagnards said Vietnamese police visited their community near Bangkok accompanied by Thai police, pressured them to return to Vietnam, and questioned them about other Montagnards who they said were wanted for arrest in Vietnam.

Several Montagnards described their interactions with Vietnamese police in detention or during check ins. “First they say they’ll be more lenient if you agree to return,” one said. “Of course we don’t believe them. They have been harassing our community for a long time.” Another said a Vietnamese police officer pulled him aside from the others when he had his monthly check-in with Thai immigration officials: “‘You’ve been here [in Thailand] for a long time, and still not been resettled to the United States. When are you ever going to get to go?’ They said, ‘If you stay here and the government here makes problems for you, then you can call us, and we’ll help you.’ The meaning to me was a threat. They’ll tell the Thai police to arrest us.”

In April, Vietnamese police pulled aside some Montagnard men during their check-in sessions with Thai immigration authorities. “They took some of us aside and yelled at us,” said a Montagnard Christian. He said that the police officer threatened them: “All Montagnards here are terrorists. We’ll tell them [Thai police] that you’re terrorists, and if you worship together [in church], the Thai police are to arrest you.”

After the arrests of scores of Montagnards in February, immigration lawyers successfully posted bail for most detainees, but Thai authorities rejected bail for two of them, Y Phuong Enuol and Y Duong Bkrong, reportedly because of warrants for their arrest in Vietnam, said advocates familiar with their case. UN rights experts noted in their July letter to the Thai government that Vietnamese officials in March visited these detainees, who, the experts said, “have expressed a fear of persecution by the Vietnamese authorities.”

Separately, Thai authorities in February through April arrested over a dozen Hmong men registered as refugees with UNHCR. Family members and rights advocates said most were affiliated with the Hmong Human Rights Coalition, a civil society group that monitors and reports on human rights violations against Hmong people in Vietnam. Vietnamese officials visited these detainees on multiple occasions in late April and early May at the Suan Phlu immigration detention center. They encouraged detainees to voluntarily return to Vietnam and to sign forms to facilitate their repatriation. None agreed. Most of the men remain in detention as of November 2025.

Thai authorities have detained Giang A Au, a Hmong Christian pastor who fled Vietnam with his family 10 years ago, with his wife and daughters several times, including as recently as April. His son, Giang A Nanh, 25, told Human Rights Watch in August that his father called him from immigration detention in early May and told him that he had been visited by a Vietnamese official, who identified himself as “Mr. Hung,” who had the father’s Vietnamese passport and national ID card, confiscated by Thai authorities during his arrest.

Giang A Nanh said that Hung told his father: “You and your family have been in Thailand for nearly 10 years. Vietnam has changed a lot. The United States has also closed its doors to refugees. There is no place left for you to go. Now you must return to Vietnam.” Giang A Au refused, and Hung said: “Remember, you have children waiting for you outside. You also have relatives in Vietnam, we know them all.” Hung then said that even if Giang A Au obtained bail, Thai police would rearrest him and that he would not be able to work in Thailand. If he tried to work, Hung said, Thai police would arrest him again.

Human Rights Watch learned in November that Thai authorities in late September had arrested the son, Giang A Nanh, and sent him to a Thai jail. After a month, the authorities transferred him to Thai immigration detention, where he has been held with his father and mother along with other Vietnamese detainees. His younger sisters, 18 and 21, are now the only adult caregivers of his younger brothers, ages 11 and 14.

The wives of five other detained Hmong activists said that their husbands had told them by telephone in April through July that Vietnamese security officials had visited them in detention and attempted to compel them to sign papers agreeing to be repatriated to Vietnam. The men refused, aware that the government considers them to be dissidents who have broken the law.

Vietnam state-run media have repeatedly broadcast reports that Hmong dissidents who left Vietnam without permission and criticized the government were criminals. A June 2024 broadcast on the government ANTV State Security Television featured a report on some of the 13 Hmong men arrested in March 2025, including Ma Seo Chang, Ma A Dinh, and Ma A Sinh.

The report said they had “illegally emigrated” to Thailand and claimed that the men were “defaming the policies of the [Communist] Party and Vietnamese State, fabricating false accusations about democracy, human rights, or religious freedom is the way these expatriates make a living.” Ma A Dinh and Ma A Sinh, who later obtained bail, said that the government considers them and other Hmong men arrested in March “enemies of the state.” ANTV again focused on the three men in April 2025, just after their arrest in Thailand, and in July 2025, and mocked their views.

Another Hmong activist, Lu A Da, a coordinator with the Hmong Human Rights Coalition in Thailand who fled Vietnam in 2020, said that he also encountered Vietnamese authorities twice after he was arrested and placed in Thai immigration detention in December 2023. His arrest had occurred just two weeks after he had spoken virtually on a UN human rights panel addressing discrimination against Indigenous groups in Vietnam.

Lu A Da said a Vietnam police official visited him in detention and that the official’s attempts to pressure him suggested to him that the Vietnamese government had sought his arrest. The official attempted to convince him to return to Vietnam, saying he would quickly process paperwork before the upcoming Lunar New Year. Lu A Da said, “When I refused his offer, he threatened me, warning, ‘You may do whatever you want in Thailand, but think about your family in Vietnam,’ This was intended to intimidate me into stopping my human rights work.”

Immigration Detention as Possible Vietnamese Proxy Detention

Several refugees and immigration and human rights advocates in Bangkok expressed concern that the Vietnamese authorities effectively made use of Thailand’s immigration detention system to incarcerate and punish prominent Montagnard and Hmong exiles, as well as to exert pressure on them and their communities to return to Vietnam.

Some former detainees said that during visits to Thai detention, Vietnamese officials said that they had requested that Thai immigration authorities continue their detention until they agreed to return to Vietnam.

In at least one case, the Thai authorities rebuffed a Vietnamese government request after the UN intervened. Lu A Da, of the Hmong Human Rights Coalition in Thailand, said that Vietnamese authorities, after pressing him to return when he was in Thai detention in late 2023, were subsequently unable to have his detention extended, after the UN officials secured his release. The Vietnamese government then ramped up their public campaign against him and other Hmong exiles, labeling them criminals.",http://prachataienglish.com/sites/default/files/styles/super_cover_upload/public/files-super-cover/2025/2025-11/54889889535_9c9d08e8e8_k.jpg.webp?itok=YITPFM_p,N,,2025-11-17 05:56:42.188065

Steven Fazzari, the Bert A. and Jeanette L. Lynch Distinguished Professor of Economics, and Chris Varvares, the regional director for the Americas at the Economist Intelligence Unit and a WashU alumnus, were invited to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump’s economic policies.

The event, titled “High Stakes, Uncertain Gains: Trump’s Economic Experiment So Far,” was hosted by the Weidenbaum Center on the Economy, Government, and Public Policy. Both panelists invoked the Center’s late founder and namesake Murray Weidenbaum, a former WashU professor and economist who served in the Nixon and Reagan administrations.

“I think to a large extent, he would be appalled,” Fazzari said of Trump’s economic policies, adding that this year has seen the “most unusual” economic agenda of his lifetime.

Varvares identified some of the key areas of what he called a “smorgasbord” of economic policies pursued by the Trump administration, which included tariffs, immigration, industrial policy, energy production, and regulation reduction. He added that the administration’s proposed tariff rates would raise domestic prices and increase costs for Americans.

“It’s like a tax on consumers, because ultimately firms will pass [tariff costs] forward into final goods prices,” Varvares said. “And so it acts almost like a sales tax. It raises the cost to consumers.”

Both Varvares and Fazzari also attributed instability in the economy to the White House’s unpredictable announcements implementing and retracting various tariffs.

“The chaotic rollout of these tariffs has created a huge amount of uncertainty,” Varvares said.

Varvares said that the economic uncertainty produced by the administration is contributing to companies’ decreased investments and job offerings.

“If you drive into a fog bank, what’s the first thing you do? You slow down,” Varvares said. “And so that lack of visibility of exactly what was going to happen was anticipated to lead firms to pull back on investment, either scale back or delay decisions, but also to reduce hiring, not knowing exactly whether the demand was going to be there for their products.”

Varvares also criticized the White House for “strong-arming” private firms and foreign governments into increasing their investment in the United States.

“This is actually a type of governmental extortion where ‘If you want this lower tariff rate, you must invest in our country,’” Varvares said.

Varvarves did acknowledge the positive revenue effects of the tariffs, which he said could increase annual revenue for the federal government by as much as 300 billion dollars. He also said that while inflation had not increased as much as some expected after the tariff announcements, he still forecasted a bump in inflation in the next couple of financial quarters.

Fazzari said that a recession seemed likely earlier in the year after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on April 2, which the White House dubbed “Liberation Day.” He attributed the more modest economic damage so far to a lack of retaliation from other countries, with China being a notable exception, and the administration repeatedly cancelling its own tariffs after previous announcements.

“What [the tariffs] means in the long term could easily be that other countries say we really can’t rely on the United States, as we did before, and we should decouple our economy from the U.S.,” Fazzari said. “You see some of that already happening, but at least in the short term, we’ve seen less retaliation than we might have expected.”

Varvares pointed out that while one of the administration’s goals in implementing new tariffs has been to incentivize more domestic manufacturing, manufacturing jobs have decreased over the past few months. Fazzari said that advances in technology and automation will continue to reduce manufacturing jobs regardless of where products are produced.

While the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously spearheaded by Elon Musk, drew headlines earlier this year for its cuts to federal programs and jobs, Fazzari said that most of its efforts were “theater” that had little effect on the overall economy.

Both panelists also panned the administration’s interference in independent federal agencies. Varvares criticized Trump’s “jawboning” of the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and for threatening the independence of the Fed. Fazzari also expressed concern that Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after July jobs reports and revisions to previous reports indicated a weakening labor market.

“[McEntarfer was fired] for not any particular reason, except the president didn’t like the numbers,” Fazzari said. “That was controversial and upsetting to economists that really rely on good data coming out of these very professional institutions in the federal government that put together our data.”

Fazzari and Varvares both objected to the administration’s cuts to research and universities, saying that both are critical to producing new technologies that improve economic growth and productivity over time.

“It’s very disturbing in terms of the longer-run prospects to see the U.S. government cutting back on science and technology and hammering universities,” Fazzari said. “Universities are a source of a lot of the new ideas that find their way into new technologies and find their way into economic growth.”

Varvares added that the administration’s deportations and restrictive immigration practices would impede population growth and therefore slow future economic growth.

Fazzari noted that large investments in artificial intelligence have stimulated economic growth and financial markets, offsetting negative economic impacts from policies like tariffs.

“Without that, many analysts say the economy may well have been in a recession now, but we have this kind of offsetting effect that’s coming from the AI,” Fazzari said. “There’s, of course, a fear that’s a bubble. There’s a fear that that might all collapse and that we could have a problem.”

Despite their criticisms, both panelists emphasized the uncertainty around the future and that many of the administration’s economic policies will take time before we see their real effects.

“I think 44 years of economics, if it’s taught me anything, it’s that we have to be very humble in terms of what we can predict and what we can’t predict,” Fazzari said.",https://www.studlife.com/files/2025/11/trump-economic-by-Rachel-Benitez-Borrego-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 09:56:50.628595

The Guardian says the home secretary's plans to overhaul the asylum system have prompted ""significant unease"" among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on ""resignation watch"". Party insiders have told the i Paper that the success - or otherwise - of the changes will determine whether or not Labour wins the next general election. The Times describes the plans as a ""significant escalation"" of government action against illegal immigration. But the Daily Mail claims that Labour backbenchers and left-wing lawyers are poised to defeat them.

The Sun's editorial also sounds a note of scepticism about the likely success of Shabana Mahmood's plans. It says they are ""doomed to failure unless she takes the only step that deep down she must know will end the crisis - quitting the flawed and outdated European Convention on Human Rights"". The Telegraph focuses on the government's plan to stop issuing UK visas to people from three African countries which refuse to take back failed asylum seekers. The paper says the bans mirror a policy introduced by Donald Trump, and could in the future be applied to Iran, Bangladesh, and Somalia.

There is still plenty of pre-Budget speculation. The Times claims a new tax will be levied on tourists, which will allow metropolitan mayors to raise hundreds of millions of pounds for local services. The Telegraph claims a tax on milkshakes is being lined up, to make the public healthier. The Financial Times thinks online sports gambling is in the chancellor's sights - but says that horseracing will be exempted.

The Mirror says all plaques bearing the name of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor have been removed from the Falkland Islands. It says he was once hailed as hero there, but he has now been ""erased"" because of his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The Times thinks there are signs that striking resident doctors in England are turning against their union, the BMA. It quotes a letter to hospital chiefs from the NHS chief executive, which says ""there have been fewer doctors striking"" in this walkout than in any of the 12 previous rounds of industrial action. The BMA has said striking is a last resort.

The Texas National Guard members sent to Chicago were returning to their home states, two U.S. officials told ABC News on Saturday.

The federalized Guard troops arrived to the Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago in early October, but they never deployed operationally because of legal challenges that continue playing out in court.

""Illinois will continue fighting for our state sovereignty, protecting people's rights, and keeping our communities peaceful.

""And, as we have said since the beginning...

DHS makes it easier for immigration agents to destroy records

The Department of Homeland Security’s new text preservation policy will reduce the number of records saved and make it harder to hold immigration officials accountable.

DHS recently submitted a court filing as part of a lawsuit brought by the watchdog group American Oversight, stating that it had deactivated its system that automatically preserved text messages. It now requires officials to take screenshots of their text messages, which leaves too much room for human error and doesn’t capture links or attachments.

Manual review will ensure that records fall through the cracks, and in the year 2025 we should not have less automation in records management; we should have more of it.

Public records hand Justice Department, FBI two black eyes

The Justice Department’s case against former FBI director James Comey hinges in large part on an assertion that Comey authorized someone “at the FBI” to engage with the media about the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton. Lawfare’s Anna Bower dug through hundreds of Freedom of Information Act records, recently released in response to a 2018 FOIA lawsuit brought by The Daily Caller and posted in the FBI’s online FOIA library, “The Vault,” and discovered evidence that appears to undermine Justice’s case against Comey. The public records show that the person “at the FBI” — Daniel Richman — wasn’t a bureau employee during the communications cited by prosecutors.

Considering the possible implications for the Comey case, my big question is: How long will it take FBI director Kash Patel, who is already allegedly furious that his public flight schedules revealed he was abusing government property to visit his girlfriend and visit a place called “Boondoggle Ranch,” to try and take down politically inconvenient documents from The Vault?",https://media.freedom.press/media/images/26250149848_380687e3a3_b.original.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 00:57:02.426748

Last month, about 200 federalized California National Guard soldiers were sent to Portland, while another 200 federalized Texas National Guard soldiers were sent to Chicago. All those soldiers will return, the official said.

In both cases, the White House had argued that the troops were being sent to ""protect federal assets and personnel,"" with the president invoking Title 10 of the federal code, which allows for its use if the president deems that ""there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.""

Federal judges, however — in response to lawsuits brought by city and state officials — had so far blocked federalized National Guard soldiers from actually being deployed on the streets of Portland and Chicago, keeping them in a kind of holding pattern while they awaited the legal wrangling of their cases to play out.

Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members.","CHICAGO -- Baltazar Enriquez starts most mornings with street patrols, leaving his home in Chicago’s Little Village on foot or by car to find immigration agents that have repeatedly targeted his largely Mexican neighborhood.

Wearing an orange whistle around his neck, the activist broadcasts his plans on Facebook.

“We don’t know if they’re going to come back. All we know is we’ve got to get ready,” he tells thousands of followers. “Give us any tips if you see any suspicious cars.”

Moments later, his phone buzzes.

As an unprecedented immigration crackdown enters a third month, a growing number of Chicago residents are fighting back against what they deem a racist and aggressive overreach of the federal government. The Democratic stronghold’s response has tapped established activists and everyday residents from wealthy suburbs to working class neighborhoods.

They say their efforts — community patrols, rapid responders, school escorts, vendor buyouts, honking horns and blowing whistles — are a uniquely Chicago response that other cities President Donald Trump has targeted for federal intervention want to model.

“The strategy here is to make us afraid. The response from Chicago is a bunch of obscenities and ‘no,’” said Anna Zolkowski Sobor, whose North Side neighborhood saw agents throw tear gas and tackle an elderly man. “We are all Chicagoans who deserve to be here. Leave us alone.”

Perhaps the clearest indicator of Chicago’s growing resistance is the sound of whistles.

Enriquez is credited with being among the first to introduce the concept. For months Little Village residents have used them to broadcast the persistent presence of immigration agents.

Furious blasts both warn and attract observers who record video or criticize agents. Arrests, often referred to as kidnappings because many agents cover their faces, draw increasingly agitated crowds. Immigration agents have responded aggressively.

Officers fatally shot one man during a traffic stop, while other agents use tear gas, rubber bullets and physical force. In early November, Chicago police were called to investigate shots fired at agents. No one was injured.

Activists say they discourage violence.

“We don’t have guns. All we have is a whistle,” Enriquez said. “That has become a method that has saved people from being kidnapped and unlawful arrest.”

By October, neighborhoods citywide were hosting so-called “Whistlemania” events to pack the brightly colored devices for distribution through businesses and free book hutches.

“They want that orange whistle,” said Gabe Gonzalez, an activist. “They want to nod to each other in the street and know they are part of this movement.”

Even with its 2.7 million people, Chicago residents like to say the nation’s third-largest city operates as a collection of small towns with Midwest sensibilities.

People generally know their neighbors and offer help. Word spreads quickly.

When immigration agents began targeting food vendors, Rick Rosales, enlisted his bicycle advocacy group Cycling x Solidarity. He hosted rides to visit street vendors, buying out their inventory to lower their risk while supporting their business.

Irais Sosa, co-founder of the apparel store Sin Titulo, started a neighbor program with grocery runs and rideshare gift cards for families afraid of venturing out.

“That neighborhood feel and support is part of the core of Chicago,” she said.

Enriquez’s organization, Little Village Community Council, saw its volunteer walking group which escorts children to school, grow from 13 to 32 students.

Many also credit the grassroots nature of the resistance to Chicago's long history of community and union organizing.

Trump's “border czar” Tom Homan said Chicago area residents were so familiar with their rights that making arrests during a different operation this year was difficult.

So when hundreds of federal agents arrived in September, activists poured energy into an emergency hotline that dispatches response teams to gather intel, including names of those detained. Volunteers would also circulate videos online, warn of reoccurring license plates or follow agents' cars while honking horns.

Protests have also cropped up quickly. Recently, high school students have launched walkouts.

Delilah Hernandez, 16, was among dozens from Farragut Career Academy who protested on a school day.She held a sign with the Constitution's preamble as she walked in Little Village. She knows many people with detained relatives.

“There is so much going on,” she said. “You feel it.”

More than 3,200 people suspected of violating immigration laws have been arrested during the so-called “ Operation Midway Blitz.” Dozens of U.S. citizens and protesters have been arrested with charges ranging from resisting arrest to conspiring to impede an officer.

The Department of Homeland Security defends the operation, alleging officers face hostile crowds as they pursue violent criminals.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who’s brought controversial tactics from operations in Los Angeles, called Chicago a “very non permissive environment.” He blamed sanctuary protections and elected leaders and defended agents’ actions, which are the subject of lawsuits.

But the operation's intensity could subside soon.

Bovino told The Associated Press this month that U.S. Customs and Border Protection will target other cities. He didn't elaborate, but Homeland Security officials confirmed Saturday that an immigration enforcement surge had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

DHS, which oversees CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has said operations won't end in Chicago.

Alonso Zaragoza, with a neighborhood organization in the heavily immigrant Belmont Cragin, has printed hundreds of “No ICE” posters for businesses. Organizers in Oregon and Missouri have asked for advice.

“It’s become a model for other cities,” Zaragoza said. “We’re building leaders in our community who are teaching others.”

The turnout for virtual know-your-rights trainings offered by the pro-democracy group, States at the Core, doubled from 500 to 1,000 over a recent month, drawing participants from New Jersey and Tennessee.

“We train and we let go, and the people of Chicago are the ones who run with it,” said organizer Jill Garvey.

Enriquez completes up to three patrol shifts daily. Beyond the physical exertion, the work takes a toll.

Federal agents visited his home and questioned family members. A U.S. citizen relative was handcuffed by agents. His car horn no longer works, which he attributes to overuse.

“This has been very traumatizing,” he said. “It is very scary because you will remember this for the rest of your life.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/be83d873-9bdc-4037-8614-ae28334d13bc/wirestory_df72b2ba4e57befc085d692d227363b8_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:39.156637

Britain will overhaul its approach to human rights laws to make it easier to deport migrants who arrive in the country illegally as part of a major shake-up of asylum policy to be set out on Monday.

Interior minister Shabana Mahmood will outline changes to how the European Convention on Human Rights will be interpreted by courts, the government said.

""These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here,"" Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.

In what the government claims to be the most sweeping asylum policy overhaul of modern times, Mahmood will also announce plans to make refugee status temporary and to quadruple the length of time refugees will have to wait for permanent settlement in Britain.

Britain's Labour government is taking a tougher stance as it struggles to curb clandestine migration, particularly via small boat crossings. Polls indicate immigration is a top concern of voters, and the populist Reform UK party has a commanding lead in polls.

TOUGHER STANCE

The government said Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to a family life, was being misused by migrants to delay their removal from Britain.

It wants new laws to make clear that a family connection means immediate family, such as a parent or child, preventing people from ""using dubious connections to stay in the UK"".

It added that Britain would also work with like-minded countries to review the application of Article 3, which prohibits torture, noting the ""definition of 'inhuman and degrading treatment' has expanded beyond what is reasonable.""

The government has said it wants to remain in the European Convention on Human Rights, amid calls from Reform and some in the Conservative Party for Britain to leave it altogether.

However, the government's harder stance on immigration has been criticised by charities who say it forces desperate people further into destitution.

""These proposals will punish people who've already lost everything,"" said Sile Reynolds, Head of Asylum Advocacy at Freedom from Torture. ""Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country.""

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said Britain was a ""fair, tolerant and compassionate country,"" but that in a more volatile world ""people need to know our borders are secure.""

The government added that there would also be reforms to streamline the appeals system, to fast-track the deportation of criminals and to prevent against misuse of modern slavery laws to impede removals.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:41.821972

“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate.
Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.
The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.","Shabana Mahmood has warned Labour MPs that “dark forces are stirring up anger” over migration, amid growing alarm among senior party figures over the most sweeping overhaul of refugee rights in a generation.

On Monday, Mahmood will announce controversial new laws to overhaul refugee status, which must be reassessed every two years, as well as curbing asylum appeals and toughening the approach to rights to family life.

The home secretary warned in an article for the Guardian that anger about illegal migration could turn on second-generation immigrants such as her and rupture community relations.

“I know that a country without secure borders is a less safe country for those who look like me,” she said.

But the Guardian understands the harshness of Mahmood’s plans has led to significant unease among senior Labour aides and ministers, with at least one on resignation watch. Two said they were particularly concerned about the plans to ramp up deportations of refugee families, including those with children.

Charities warned it would risk “another Windrush scandal” and leave refugees in near-permanent limbo, with children liable to be unrooted from schools and adults unable to build careers, and make integration harder.

The home secretary will announce three new safe routes for refugees to legally come to the UK from war-torn countries such as Sudan and Eritrea, but even the status of those refugees will be under constant review.

Mahmood confirmed on Sunday that refugees would be liable to be returned if their country was no longer deemed dangerous, with their status reviewed every 30 months, including families with young children in school.

The government will announce that it will legislate to toughen how courts apply the European convention on human rights (ECHR) regarding family life, enabling more deportation of people with family members still in the UK.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

In her article for the Guardian, Mahmood said she knew the changes would “face opposition” but said the alternative would risk public support for all refugees collapsing.

“Dark forces are stirring up anger in this country, and seeking to turn that anger into hate. We must take the opportunity we have to stop that from happening. And I know we can,” she wrote.

“The true nature of this country is openness, tolerance and generosity. We want to provide sanctuary to those in danger. We want to be a Greater Britain, not a littler England. To do so, we must restore order and control.”

Mahmood will announce three “modest” routes for refugees from war-torn countries such as Sudan, Palestine or Eritrea to come if they are students and those seeking to work in certain professions, as well as those sponsored by community and voluntary organisations who support them when they arrive. Refugees arriving via those routes will not be given permanent settled status.

Other key measures to be announced on Monday include:

Restricting asylum seekers to one single appeal rather than different appeals on multiple grounds.

Creating a new body for fast-tracking cases for dangerous criminals and those with little hope of success.

Legislating to restrict last-minute modern slavery claims

Joining other countries in seeking reform of ECHR article 3 rights, to more narrowly define the risk of torture and degrading treatment.

Changing the Home Office’s duty to provide support to asylum seekers to a discretionary power, enabling them to potentially be removed from accommodation.

Several senior aides are understood to have severe reservations about how that would affect school-age children and MPs are understood to be particularly concerned about Ukrainian refugees, many of whom brought young children who have now fully integrated into British life.

“These sweeping changes will mean that a child who is settled at school, studying hard for their GCSEs, will be uprooted and forcibly removed, possibly being put in detention as part of that process,” the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon said, likening it to how long-settled people were treated under the Windrush scandal.

Mahmood is also understood to be seeking to legislate to change the way the ECHR is interpreted by UK judges. Asylum seekers often use its provisions on right to family life in order to stay in the UK.

The effect of the changes could mean many more people are deported from the UK even if they have young children living here. Judges will be required to prioritise “public safety” over family rights. A Home Office source suggested this would be more likely to apply to extended family.

On Sunday night it also emerged that Mahmood had threatened three countries with visa bans for refusing to take people back from the UK.

The Times reported that Mahmood wrote to the embassies in London of Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday, warning that they have a month to start cooperating on removals before a sliding scale of sanctions are imposed. Mahmood is expected to confirm the measures on Monday.

Mahmood is to warn concerned Labour MPs that the changes are necessary to address public concern about the levels of migration as well as counterattacks from Reform UK.

“Unless we act, we risk losing popular consent for having an asylum system at all. In a country that is seeing division stirred up on our streets, we will not bring unity unless we restore order to our borders,” she wrote in the Guardian.

“My goal is to ensure there are legal routes into this country for those who are truly fleeing peril, and for whom this is the first safe country they have encountered.”

The Home Office has briefed widely that Mahmood has been inspired by the Danish system, which has much tighter rules on family reunions as well as on refugee status.

Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, temporarily suspended new applications in September from a family reunion route that allowed those granted asylum in the UK to bring their family.

Home Office sources have suggested the asylum changes will have far wider effects than anything brought in by the Conservatives.

Almost 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats to claim asylum in the UK so far this year and the number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high. Government figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025.

Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have said they would leave the ECHR in order to undertake more severe measures to cut migration. Mahmood has said she will not leave the ECHR, but there are likely to be significant legal challenges to what she is proposing on Monday.

The Conservatives have suggested the party could support the plans brought forward by Mahmood if she faces a rebellion from Labour backbenchers.

But the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, criticised the plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”.

He told Sky News’s Sunday Morning with Trevor Phillips programme: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Several loyalist MPs told the Guardian they were deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of disrupting the lives of settled refugee families if their countries became safer to return to. At least one minister is understood to have severe reservations.

The Labour MP Tony Vaughan urged the government to “think again” on the changes. “The prime minister said in September that we are at a fork in the road. These asylum proposals suggest we have taken the wrong turning,” he posted on X.

“The idea that recognised refugees need to be deported is wrong. The rhetoric around these reforms encourages the same culture of divisiveness that sees racism and abuse growing in our communities.”

The Labour MP Stella Creasy wrote in the Guardian that leaving refugees in a state of “perpetual limbo” for 20 years was economically as well as morally damaging. “If we want to stop the boats we need to stop the BS when it comes to what is generating refugees or how to respond to them,” she said.

“If you can’t stabilise your status, you will always struggle to get a job, a bank account or a mortgage, making it more likely you will be dependent on state or voluntary support.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0306afc05b3889975ec0cccb99b6e3b7b91945a/556_190_3808_3046/master/3808.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57c95e34d7dea960e716f67ac913f689",N,,2025-11-16 18:56:45.797224

Under sweeping reforms unveiled by the home secretary, the government will attempt to change the way the European Convention on Human Rights is interpreted by UK judges in a bid to stop asylum seekers using their rights to a family life to avoid deportation.

Home Office officials have claimed the ECHR “is allowing large numbers of people to stay in the UK, against the public’s wishes”, and that new legislation will allow Britain to ramp up the number of removals.

The radical measures are part of much-publicised reform of the asylum system, billed by the government as “the most sweeping reforms in modern times”, as Labour looks to see off the threat of Reform UK and Nigel Farage.

But critics have hit out at the proposals, warning any move to alter how the UK interprets the rules will drive asylum seekers underground and leave them vulnerable to exploitation.

Sile Reynolds, the head of asylum advocacy at Freedom from Torture, said the changes “will punish people who’ve already lost everything”, adding: “Either we all have human rights, or none of us do.”

The measures could also spark discontent on the backbenches, with one Labour MP accusing the party leadership of “chasing Reform”. They told The Independent: “The dehumanisation of people in desperation is the antithesis of what the Labour Party is about.”

Announcing the changes, Sir Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, said they will “block endless appeals” and “stop last minute claims”.

He said: “Britain has always been a fair, tolerant and compassionate country – and this government will always defend those values.

“But, in a more volatile world, people need to know our borders are secure and rules are enforced.

“These reforms will block endless appeals, stop last minute claims and scale up removals of those with no right to be here.”

Shabana Mahmood will set out plans to rewrite how Britain grants refuge to those fleeing conflict and upheaval on Monday, drawing heavily on ideas used in Denmark, where Home Office officials were dispatched last month to study its border control and asylum policies.

Under the proposed changes, ministers want to bring forward a Bill to change how Article 8 of the ECHR – the right to a family life – is interpreted by judges in migrant court cases a bid to stop migrants “gaming the system” and to “rebalance public interest tests in favour of the British people’s expectations”.

The home secretary also wants to tighten up rules on family connections so that only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay in future.

Rules will also be updated to change modern slavery laws, which officials claim are being abused by “bogus” claims, while the appeals process will be updated to restrict illegal migrants to a single route of appeal to stop them “chancing their arm with challenge after challenge”.

The UK will also be working on further reform around Article 3, which relates to the prohibition of torture. Officials have claimed the definition of inhuman and degrading treatment “has expanded too far”, citing cases where serious criminals have remained in the UK after claims their healthcare needs could not be met in their homeland.

Ms Mahmood teased the changes on Sunday, telling Sky News that ministers want to “constrain in legislation the way that that is applied in immigration cases”, when it comes to Article 8.

She said it is the “right thing to do, because we've seen an expansion of the way that that right is applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country”.

But the Refugee Council, a charity advocating on behalf of refugees, warned that watering down these laws risks chaos and will drive desperate people underground, leaving them prone to exploitation.

Following the home secretary’s comments on Sunday morning, Enver Solomon, the charity’s chief executive said: “After the horrors of the Second World War, Britain helped draft the European Convention on Human Rights as part of our collective vow of ‘never again’. Its purpose was to protect all of us from atrocities and ensure people who come to our country seeking safety get a fair chance to apply for asylum.”

He described the UK’s legal system as “the difference between life and death for many” and added: “The government has a choice to make: we can build a fair and compassionate asylum system that determines who qualifies for protection and who does not. Or we can water down laws that protect us all and risk chaos: desperate people would still arrive on our shores, but be driven underground and left vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.”

Ms Reynolds accused political parties of being in a “race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees”.

She said: “Every day we see the trauma of people who have survived torture in countries like Syria, Eritrea and Sudan for standing up for the same freedoms we cherish in Britain. Instead of offering safety, political parties are locked in a race to the bottom – trying to outdo one another in cruelty towards refugees.

“These proposals will punish people who’ve already lost everything, cutting them off from safety and hope. But either we all have human rights, or none of us do.

“Stripping away protections that prevent people being sent back to their torturers is not who we are as a country. This is a cynical attempt to scapegoat vulnerable people to win political points. We can and must do better.”

Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has said it is “welcome that Shabana Mahmood is finally talking seriously about tackling illegal migration”, but added: “As we saw with Keir Starmer’s lamentable U-turn on modest welfare cuts, the prime minister always folds in the face of opposition from his left-wing backbenchers.

“If the home secretary actually wants to cut illegal immigration, she should take up my offer to sit down with her and work on a plan that will actually stop the boats, rather than a few weak changes that will meet the approval of Labour MPs.”

Other changes expected as part of the raft of measures are the removal of the automatic right to housing and financial support for asylum seekers, and changes to refugee status which will make it temporary and subject to review every two-and-a-half years. Those who arrive in the UK via means such as a small boat or lorry also face a 20-year wait to stay in the country permanently.

Jennifer McKiernanPolitical reporter

Plans to fast-track the deportations of illegal migrants as part of a sweeping reforms of the UK's asylum policy are to be announced by Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood.

In a statement to MPs on Monday she will outline plans to end multiple appeals against removal and for an overhaul of legislation on human rights law.

For those granted asylum they will only be given it on a temporary basis and will be returned home if their country is at any time deemed safe. They will have to wait 20 years to apply to settle permanently.

Mahmood is also warn the UK will stop granting visas to people from three African countries if their governments do not improve co-operation on removals of illegal migrants.

Mahmood told the BBC on Sunday: ""This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities.""

Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said he would go further and deport failed asylum seekers ""within a week"".

The plans have prompted criticism from some Labour MPs, including Rachael Maskell, who said the government was going in ""completely the wrong direction"" on immigration.

The government wants to reduce the number of people arriving to the UK on small boats and the reforms aim to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals as well as make it more difficult for successful asylum seekers to remain.

Under the plans people will be restricted to arguing their grounds for appeal within a single appeal and if a case fails, they will be deported.

The government will follow the Danish model of creating an independent body to fast-track the deportation of foreign criminals and cases with little prospect of success through the appeals system.

As part of the reforms, Mahmood wants to overhaul how human rights legislation, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which covers the right to family life, is applied in migration court cases.

Only those with immediate family in the UK, such as a parent or child, will be able to use Article 8 as grounds to stay.

The UK will join other countries in reforming Article 3 of the ECHR, which is designed to give people protection against inhuman or degrading treatment.

The government believes this has been used to support unreasonable claims, including serious criminals having their deportation blocked because their healthcare needs cannot be met.

Similarly, the Home Office said the Modern Slavery Act will be tightened up to prevent last-minute claims to block removal.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the reforms would stop ""endless appeals"" to increase the removals of ""those with no right to be here"".

Mahmood said the reforms recognised the ""pace and scale"" of immigration had destabilised and divided communities and would allow the government to ramp up the removal of those with no right to be in Britain.

She continued: ""To maintain the generosity that allows us to provide sanctuary, we must restore order and control.""

Earlier the home secretary told the BBC she would create new safe and legal routes for refugees through work and study routes.

Under the new measures there will be tighter restrictions placed on successful asylum seekers, who will have their case reviewed every two and a half years and if their home country is considered safe they will be returned.

A refugee will have to have been resident in the UK for 20 years, up from the current five years, in order to apply for permanent residence or indefinite leave to remain.

They will not be able to bring family members to join them unless they are immediate relatives, including parents and children, while housing and weekly allowances will also no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.

'Years of limbo'

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.

The appeals system currently has a backlog of more than 50,000 and a waiting time of at least a year.

There has also been criticism of the proposed reforms from within Labour, with Maskell saying lots of her fellow MPs were ""really concerned"".

She said it was important to have a robust human rights framework and described ""reordering our relationship with the ECHR"" as a ""step too far"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said the home secretary ""sounds like a Reform supporter"".

""It's a shame that the Human Rights Act, ECHR and her own backbenchers mean that this will never happen,"" he added.

Liberal Democrats home affairs spokesperson Max Wilkinson said the government should ""focus on processing claims quickly, getting them right first time, and swiftly deporting people with no right to be here"".

Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said rather than deter migrants, the 20-year time frame would ""leave people in limbo and in tense anxiety for many, many years"".

As first reported in the Times, the threat of the visa ban for Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo comes after thousands of illegal migrants and criminals from the three nations were said to be in the UK.

A Home Office source said the countries were being targeted ""for their unacceptably low cooperation and obstructive returns processes"".

Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.
Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems.
“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.” Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system.
A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.","Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

The new 20-year qualifying period will apply to those who arrive illegally, such as in small boats or in lorries, and claim asylum, or those who overstay their visas and then claim. It will be the longest route to settlement in Europe; Denmark is second, with an eight-year pathway.

The changes, hailed as the largest overhaul since the Second World War, will apply only to new arrivals.

In the year to June, a total of 111,000 people claimed asylum in the UK. In the year ending March, 172,798 people were granted ILR under the process.

There will be some mitigations for skilled refugees, enabling them to truncate the 20-year qualification period by going into “specific” work or study routes. “It will be essentially a system whereby the more you contribute, you can bring forward that [20-year] period,” Mahmood said.

A ten-year pathway will also be created for those who arrive in the UK legally, under new specific refugee settlement routes to be announced by Mahmood on Thursday.

The plans are modelled on reforms in Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

Mahmood will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers. The government intends to use legislation to repeal a European Union directive that underpins the requirement.

‘We want them to work’

Housing and weekly allowances will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to. Those who break the law will also face having their support withdrawn.

Mahmood said: “Before that directive, we actually had a much more discretionary power that we could use, where we could make our own decision about whether we are going to offer someone asylum support or not. The reason we’re doing that [reverting to the previous powers] is that there are some people who currently receive asylum support who can work, who have the right to work, and we want them to work.”

She will also announce reforms to the application of key elements of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), including article 8, the right to a family life. She is expected to raise the need for international reform of article 3, covering torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Both have been blamed for hindering Britain’s ability to remove illegal migrants and failed asylum seekers.

‘Our fundamental nature is generous’

The home secretary believes the changes are necessary to address voters’ sense of unfairness when asylum seekers are treated more generously than economic migrants who arrive on visas, despite the fact that the latter group must meet strict financial and integration requirements.

Even in her constituency of Birmingham Ladywood, one of the most diverse areas of the country, Mahmood said that migration was causing problems. “I think that people rightly feel that the pace and the scale of what we’ve seen is out of control. It’s putting a huge amount of pressure on communities,” she said. “My patch is 70 per cent non-white, but immigration is something that’s causing just as much concern here as it does all across other parts of the country.

“I think our fundamental nature as a people is that we are open, tolerant and generous,” she said, but the “precondition of unlocking the full extent of that openness is order and control”.

President Trump told GB News on Friday that Sir Keir Starmer “better do something on immigration”, describing some of those who arrived on small boats as “bad people” and warning: “If you don’t get them out, you’re not going to have a country left”.

Mahmood argued that the changes would make it both easier to remove illegal immigrants already in Britain and deter those considering crossing the Channel in small boats. “I can see a system that is out of control, I can see a system that is unfair and I can see a system that’s putting huge pressure on communities, including my own,” she said.

‘It’s designed to say: Do not get on a boat’

Her reforms would seek to “change the assumptions” about what it means to be a refugee, while also changing the “calculus and the thinking” of those people who are risking their lives on small boats by reducing the so-called pull factors that are drawing illegal immigrants.

This will include ending the “automatic path” to settled status after a refugee has been in Britain for five years. That will rise to 20 years and will have certain conditions attached, such as having no criminal record.

“That is designed to essentially say to people: do not come to this country as an illegal migrant, do not get on a boat,” she said. “I think it’s important that we send a very clear signal to those people who are currently trekking across multiple safe countries across Europe looking to get on a boat in the north of France: this is not a journey worth making.”

President Macron of France has called on the UK to address the pull factors behind small-boat crossings. Germany is already committed to working with the UK on the issue and Mahmood is understood to be in “embryonic talks” with Belgium and the Netherlands.

Mahmood, the eldest daughter of immigrants from the Pakistani side of Kashmir and a devout Muslim, said that she knew the reforms would be a hard sell to some in her party, who are concerned that Labour is trying to mimic Conservative and Reform policies.

Some Labour MPs on the left have branded the reforms as “racist”, including Nadia Whittome, the member for Nottingham East, who accused the government of pursuing the “policies of the far right”.

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, called the plans “harsh and unnecessary”, arguing they “won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars”.

Mahmood said she rejected “entirely” suggestions that her policy change was racist, pointing out that her parents came to the UK legally in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

“This is a moral mission for me,” she told Sky News on Sunday. “I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country … I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.”

Mahmood added: “What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem..”

She said that the Home Office would “bring order and control back” into the asylum system while also creating new safe and legal routes for asylum seekers to enter the UK.

The government announced last month that two army barracks, one in East Sussex and one in Scotland, would be used to house asylum seekers from December, as ministers seek to end the use of hotels within a year.

This month, a leaked Home Office document suggested that the government had identified at least 14 sites that could host up to 10,000 migrants.

On Sunday, about 2,000 people marched through the streets of Crowborough, East Sussex, to protest against plans to house 600 lone male asylum seekers in a nearby army camp.

The Crowborough site and Cameron Barracks in Inverness are the only two to have been publicly announced so far.

A plan to convert the Crowborough camp into accommodation for asylum seekers was rejected by the last Tory government due to safeguarding concerns.

Mahmood is seen as a rising star and has hinted that she may harbour leadership ambitions. Last week, Mahmood, who is one of Starmer’s closest allies, pledged her support to the prime minister and chancellor, adding: “I know that they will put the best interest of the whole country absolutely first and foremost as they make the difficult choices that are needed to get the budget to balance.”

However, she will know that if they fail, she could soon be in a new job and it will be her facing all the difficult choices — and not just how to stop the boats.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fe2ca745c-962c-4a02-9b0c-35bbf0b16603.jpg?crop=4236%2C2383%2C1374%2C492&resize=1200,N,,2025-11-16 20:56:55.091827

Several of the survivors claimed Mexican nationality, while others remained unidentified, the agency said. One person was turned over to the Department of Homeland Security.

“Our crews and partner agencies responded immediately, but this case demonstrates the severe risks posed to aliens attempting to enter the United States by sea in unstable vessels,” said Coast Guard Capt. Robert Tucker, Sector San Diego commander.

A strong storm system hit Southern California over the weekend, prompting warnings of flash flooding and mudslides. The vessel was a panga — single- or twin-engine open fishing boat that is also commonly used by smugglers.

Migrants are increasingly turning to the risky alternative offered by smugglers to travel by sea to avoid heavily guarded land borders, including off California’s coast. Pangas leave Mexico in the dead of night and sometimes chart hundreds of miles (kilometers) north.

There have been several incidents in recent years of migrant vessels capsizing en route to California.

In May, at least three people died when a panga flipped off the coast about 35 miles (56 km) north of the U.S.-Mexico border.

In 2023, eight people were killed when two migrant smuggling boats approached a San Diego beach in heavy fog and one of them capsized in the surf. It was one of the deadliest maritime smuggling incidents in waters off the U.S. coast.

A federal judge sentenced a San Diego man to 18 years in prison in 2022 for piloting a small vessel overloaded with 32 migrants that smashed apart in powerful surf off the coast, killing three people and injuring more than two dozen.

Worldwide, nearly 9,000 people died last year attempting to cross borders, according to the U.N. agency for migration. The death toll set a record for the fifth year in a row.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ApPs6gqPF_cMfzNfXIZCJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/f0d3f289f8bb305b691212c0840173ab,N,,2025-11-16 18:56:49.656337

Conclusion Massey v. Computershare reinforces a fundamental rule of federal adjudication: final judgments are final.","Introduction

In Massey v. Computershare Limited (Nos. 24-1095 & 24-1445), decided November 13, 2025, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed a District of Colorado judgment dismissing pro se plaintiff James Harrison Massey’s tort claims as barred by res judicata, upheld an award of $85,624.33 in attorney’s fees, and sustained tailored filing restrictions against further pro se litigation related to the same controversy. The court also denied Massey’s motions to file an overlength amended opening brief to introduce new evidence and expressly deemed the appeals frivolous.

The litigation traces to a lost cashier’s check that Massey alleges he sent to pay off a home equity line of credit (HELOC) serviced by Specialized Loan Servicing, LLC (SLS), affiliated with Computershare. Following SLS’s request that he stop payment and reissue funds (with assurances to honor the original payoff quote and reimburse associated costs), Massey refused, defaulted, and then embarked on serial litigation. A first federal suit in the Western District of Kentucky (Massey I) ended in dismissal; he did not appeal. He later filed anew in Colorado (Massey II) against SLS, Computershare entities, and Bank of America asserting substantially the same claims. The district court dismissed on claim-preclusion grounds, denied his collateral attack on the Kentucky judgment, awarded fees, and imposed pre-filing restrictions.

On appeal, Massey’s central theory was not a direct challenge to the Colorado court’s res judicata analysis, but a collateral attack: he argued the Kentucky judgment was void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (and related Uniform Commercial Code contentions), which, in his view, would also void the Colorado judgment, the fees, and the filing injunction. The Tenth Circuit rejected that strategy and reinforced bedrock preclusion and finality principles.

Summary of the Opinion

Affirmed: The Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal based on res judicata (claim preclusion) was proper. Massey’s claims in Colorado arose from the same nucleus of operative facts as his earlier Kentucky case, Massey I.

Affirmed: The district court correctly refused to declare the Kentucky judgment void; federal courts may not entertain collateral attacks on final federal judgments’ subject-matter jurisdiction.

Affirmed: The award of $85,624.33 in attorney’s fees and the imposition of targeted pre-filing restrictions comported with applicable standards; Massey did not advance specific, meritorious challenges to those rulings.

Denied: Motions to file an overlength amended opening brief to add “new” extra-record evidence were denied because appellate review is confined to the district court record and the evidence was immaterial to the dispositive issues.

Frivolousness: The court held the appeals were frivolous because the issues were obvious and the arguments wholly without merit. It warned that continued frivolous filings may trigger sanctions or appellate filing restrictions.

Notably, the panel emphasized that even challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be raised collaterally after a judgment has become final on direct review; they must be raised on direct appeal in the original case (here, in the Sixth Circuit). The order and judgment is nonprecedential, except under law-of-the-case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel, but may be cited for persuasive value under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 32.1 and Tenth Circuit Rule 32.1.

Analysis

Precedents Cited and Their Influence

The court anchored its disposition in longstanding Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit authority on finality, preclusion, and vexatious litigation controls:

Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Bailey and Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank: These cases establish that a federal court’s determination of its jurisdiction, while reviewable directly, is not open to collateral attack later. Once final, a judgment is res judicata even if the court arguably lacked jurisdiction.

Insurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee: Principles of res judicata apply to jurisdictional determinations. Parties who had an opportunity to litigate subject-matter jurisdiction cannot reopen it collaterally.

Kontrick v. Ryan (footnote): Reinforces the prohibition on collateral attacks even when the attack concerns subject-matter jurisdiction.

Campbell v. City of Spencer; Thomas v. Kaven; Day v. Moscow: Together set the standards for de novo review of Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals and confirm that res judicata can be resolved on a motion to dismiss when the defense is apparent from the record.

Malloy v. Monahan: Attorney’s fee awards are reviewed for abuse of discretion, with legal predicates reviewed de novo.

Tripati v. Beaman: The right to access courts is not absolute; courts may impose reasonable filing restrictions on abusive litigants, provided due process and narrow tailoring.

Committee on Conduct of Attorneys v. Oliver; Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer: Courts may relax pleading standards for pro se filings, but not for practicing lawyers; all litigants must follow the rules, and abusive filings are unacceptable. The panel opted to construe Massey’s papers liberally while insisting on proper procedure.

Regan‑Touhy v. Walgreen Co.; Singleton v. Wulff: Appellate review is confined to the record below; new issues or evidence may be entertained only in rare, compelling circumstances not present here.

Sawyers v. Norton; Braley v. Campbell: Arguments inadequately developed in the opening brief are waived; an appeal is frivolous when the result is obvious or the arguments wholly without merit.

These authorities directly shaped the court’s rejection of Massey’s collateral attack on the Kentucky judgment, its affirmance of dismissal on claim-preclusion grounds, and its endorsement of sanctions and filing controls in the face of repetitive litigation.

Legal Reasoning

Claim Preclusion Applied to Massey II:

The Colorado action arose from the same transactions underlying Massey I—namely, the alleged mailing and loss of a payoff cashier’s check and the resulting default and dispute over the HELOC. The district court dismissed claims tied to pre–May 12, 2020 facts with prejudice and later dismissed the repleaded Second Amended Complaint with prejudice, finding no meaningful differentiation from Massey I beyond references to later monthly statements.

On appeal, Massey did not attack the elements of res judicata. Instead, he argued that Massey I was void, which, if accepted, would undermine preclusion. But because that argument is a prohibited collateral attack on a final federal judgment, the claim-preclusion dismissal stands.

No Collateral Attack on Subject‑Matter Jurisdiction:

Massey contended the Kentucky court lacked diversity jurisdiction and that UCC principles extinguished his HELOC obligation when SLS allegedly received the check, rendering the case moot. The panel held it had no authority to entertain a collateral attack on the Kentucky court’s jurisdictional determination. Such challenges must be made by direct appeal in the rendering circuit (the Sixth Circuit), which Massey did not pursue in Massey I. Therefore, neither the Colorado district court nor the Tenth Circuit could declare the Kentucky judgment void.

The court noted that “rare” exceptions permitting collateral challenges to jurisdiction were neither raised nor applicable.

Vacatur Denied; Jurisdictional Arguments Were Conclusory:

The district court rejected Massey’s effort to vacate both the Kentucky judgment and the Colorado dismissal order. With respect to the Colorado case, the court observed that Massey himself invoked diversity jurisdiction and that his contrary assertions were conclusory. The Tenth Circuit affirmed.

Attorney’s Fees and Filing Restrictions Upheld:

Applying an abuse-of-discretion standard (with de novo review of the legal basis), the court affirmed the fee award and filing restrictions. Massey offered no targeted, meritorious arguments against these rulings. The injunction narrowly requires leave of court before any new pro se action in the District of Colorado against SLS or Computershare defendants on the same subject matter, and before additional post-judgment filings in the case—well within Tripati’s framework.

No Expansion of the Record on Appeal:

The panel denied motions to file an overlength amended opening brief to add a post-judgment bank “notarized statement” concerning the cashier’s check. Appellate review is generally limited to the district-court record, and the proffered document was immaterial to the dispositive ground of affirmance (the foreclosure of collateral attacks and the independent res judicata ruling).

Frivolous Appeals and Warning:

The court declared the appeals frivolous because Massey did not meaningfully challenge the dispositive rulings and his arguments were wholly without merit. It cautioned that continued frivolous filings may prompt sanctions or pre-filing restrictions at the appellate level.

The court also rejected as inadequately developed Massey’s accusations of judicial misconduct and corruption, reiterating that liberal pleading rules are not a license for abusive filings or ad hominem attacks on the trial judge.

Impact and Prospective Significance

Although issued as a nonprecedential order and judgment, the opinion has substantial persuasive value in several areas:

Finality of Federal Judgments: The decision robustly reaffirms that once a federal judgment becomes final on direct review, parties cannot collaterally contest the issuing court’s subject-matter jurisdiction in a subsequent case. This constrains forum-shopping and serial litigation designed to circumvent adverse outcomes.

Cross‑Circuit Preclusion: A judgment entered in one federal circuit (here, the Sixth Circuit’s district court) precludes relitigation in another (the Tenth Circuit) where the claims arise from the same operative facts, underscoring nationwide respect for federal judgments.

Vexatious-Litigant Controls: The affirmance of tailored filing restrictions and fees sends a clear signal that district courts may, and should, deploy these tools to protect judicial resources and defendants from repetitive, meritless suits, provided the restrictions are narrow and procedurally proper.

Appellate Practice Discipline: The denial of leave to append extra-record materials and exceed word limits highlights the strictures of appellate review: parties must fully develop their record and arguments below, and extraordinary circumstances are required to deviate from that principle.

Pro Se Treatment for Former Attorneys: The court’s choice to liberally construe filings from a formerly licensed attorney, while emphasizing adherence to procedural rules and civility, offers practical guidance on calibrating pro se leniency without enabling abuse.

For litigants and counsel, the case is a cautionary tale: challenges to jurisdiction must be timely raised in the original case via direct appeal; efforts to relitigate by collateral attack will fail and risk fee-shifting and filing injunctions.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Res judicata (Claim Preclusion): If you sue and lose, you generally cannot sue again later over the same set of facts against the same parties (or their privies), even if you present new legal theories. Final judgments close the door to re-litigating the same dispute.

Collateral Attack on a Judgment: Trying to invalidate a final judgment in a new lawsuit instead of by appealing in the original case. Federal courts do not permit this, even when the target is the original court’s subject‑matter jurisdiction.

Subject‑Matter Jurisdiction: A court’s legal power to decide a type of case (e.g., diversity jurisdiction over disputes between citizens of different states with more than $75,000 in controversy). Jurisdictional issues must be raised on direct appeal; they cannot be re-litigated later in a different court after judgment is final.

Pre‑Filing Injunction: A court order requiring a litigant to obtain permission before filing new cases or documents, used to curb abusive or repetitive litigation. Such orders must be narrow and afford due process (notice and an opportunity to be heard).

Standards of Review: On appeal, dismissals under Rule 12(b)(6) and res judicata are reviewed afresh (de novo). Fee awards and filing restrictions are reviewed for abuse of discretion, with underlying legal issues reviewed de novo.

Record on Appeal: The appellate court normally considers only what was presented to the district court. New evidence is rarely allowed and only in extraordinary, outcome‑critical circumstances, which were absent here.

Frivolous Appeal: An appeal is frivolous if the outcome is obvious or the arguments are wholly without merit. Frivolous appeals can trigger sanctions and filing restrictions.

Conclusion

Massey v. Computershare reinforces a fundamental rule of federal adjudication: final judgments are final. Parties cannot evade adverse judgments by re-filing in new forums and recasting arguments as jurisdictional defects; such collateral attacks are foreclosed by Supreme Court precedent. The Tenth Circuit’s affirmance of claim preclusion, fees, and pre-filing restrictions, coupled with its refusal to expand the record and its declaration of frivolousness, collectively underscore the judiciary’s commitment to finality, efficiency, and civility.

The decision—persuasive authority within the Tenth Circuit—provides clear guidance for district courts managing repetitive litigation, for litigants contemplating challenges to jurisdiction, and for appellate practitioners seeking to introduce new materials on appeal. Its message is straightforward: raise jurisdictional and substantive challenges in the original action and on direct appeal, or they will be lost; persist in serial, meritless litigation and sanctions may follow.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-17 08:57:44.007279

“I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.” The Labour government’s proposed changes emulate a much tougher asylum policy put in place by Denmark.

Now, though, the government is pledging to overhaul the asylum system, which handles those who land on its shores, arguing that it has turned the country into a magnet for people.","Britain rolled out a major hardening of its rules for handling asylum seekers on Sunday, reflecting the rapidly changing politics of immigration as successive British governments have failed to curb a rising influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in often unseaworthy boats.

Under the new rules, drafted by the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, people granted asylum status would have to wait 20 years, rather than the current five, before they can apply to settle permanently in Britain.

The government plans to review the status of these migrants more regularly, and if it determines at any point that their countries have become safe, they will be ordered to return home. Asylum seekers will also no longer be entitled to automatic aid, including housing and weekly allowances. Those who have a right to work in Britain will be expected to find jobs while their claims are being considered, something they are not allowed to do under the existing rules.

“Illegal migration is causing huge divides here in our own country,” Ms. Mahmood said in an interview Sunday with the BBC. “I do believe we need to act if we are to retain public consent for having an asylum system at all.”

The Labour government’s proposed changes emulate a much tougher asylum policy put in place by Denmark. The Danish system, devised like that in Britain by a center-left government, grants asylum seekers residence permits of only one or two years, with no guarantee of permanent residence. To gain permanent status, new arrivals must learn Danish and find work.

Since the rules were tightened, the number of people granted asylum in Denmark has plummeted, ending an influx of migrants, mainly from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other once war-torn countries.

Denmark’s policies have been criticized by human rights groups and challenged by the European Court of Human Rights. Its system has nevertheless become a model for other European governments, which are struggling with what many citizens view as uncontrolled immigration. Britain’s home office, which polices borders, said it had sent a delegation to Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, last summer to examine the Danish system.

But the British government’s proposals got a mixed reaction at home, where immigration has again become a salient issue in the years since Britain left the European Union. The government said that, since coming into power in July 2024, it had deported 50,000 people who had entered Britain illegally.

Nigel Farage, the leader of the anti-immigrant party Reform U.K., had rare praise for Ms. Mahmood’s tough tone. But he said the new policies would have little effect if, as he predicted, British judges and the European Court of Human Rights uphold legal challenges to deportation orders. Reform has used its anti-immigrant appeal to establish a double-digit lead over Labour in the polls.

“Labour won’t stop the boats,” Mr. Farage posted on social media on Friday, as word of the plans began leaking out.

For the government, the new proposals underscore how swiftly the political landscape has changed. Prime Minister Keir Starmer once cast the flow of asylum seekers as primarily a law enforcement problem, vowing to break up the gangs that traffic people across the English Channel from France.

Now, though, the government is pledging to overhaul the asylum system, which handles those who land on its shores, arguing that it has turned the country into a magnet for people.

The home office said that from 2021 to 2025, asylum claims dropped across much of Europe but increased in Britain. Yet Britain continues to receive fewer claims than its European counterparts: 109,343 in the year ending in March 2025, compared with 218,550 in Germany, 164,830 in Spain, 159,260 in France, and 151,525 in Italy, according to statistics released by the British government.

Europe remains a favored destination for people fleeing war, political instability, economic deprivation and other hardships. In Britain, Pakistanis are the largest group of those seeking asylum.

Critics of the government’s plan said it echoed the language of far-right parties. Clive Lewis, a Labour member of Parliament, told the BBC the plan might drive left-wing voters to the Green Party. But with the Labour Party’s huge majority in Parliament, there is little doubt that it will become law.

Ms. Mahmood, 45, a rising star in the government who became home secretary in a cabinet shake-up in September, emphasized her immigrant roots in promoting the policy. Born in Birmingham to parents with Pakistani roots, Ms. Mahmood studied law at Oxford University and worked as a barrister.

“Immigration is absolutely woven into my experience as a Brit, and also that of thousands of my constituents,” she said on the BBC program “Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.”

“This is a moral mission for me, because I can see illegal migration is tearing our country apart, it is dividing communities,” she said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/multimedia/16int-uk-immigration-02-ckfv/16int-uk-immigration-02-ckfv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-16 14:56:38.969589

President Donald Trump’s administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration’s strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here’s what to know:

Why send agents to Charlotte?

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina’s two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

How have locals reacted?

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

Is the National Guard involved?

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina’s congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor’s office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

Crackdown, inspired by Denmark's policy, draws criticism from charities, rights groups

Britain said it would make refugee status temporary and the wait for permanent settlement would be quadrupled to 20 years under the country's most sweeping overhaul of policy on asylum seekers in modern times.

The Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies, above all on illegal small-boat crossings from France, in efforts to stem the soaring popularity of the populist Reform UK party, which has driven the immigration agenda.

The government said it would take inspiration from Denmark's approach. Its policy has been widely criticized by rights groups and is one of the toughest in Europe — where growing anti-immigrant sentiment has led to increased restrictions in many countries.

As part of the changes, the statutory duty to provide support to certain asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked, the Home Office (interior ministry) said in a statement issued late on Saturday.

The department, led by Shabana Mahmood, said the measures would apply to asylum seekers who can work but choose not to and to those who break the law. It said that taxpayer-funded support would be prioritized for those contributing to the economy and local communities.

The Home Office also said that protection for refugees would ""now be temporary, regularly reviewed and revoked"" if the home country was deemed safe.

""Our system is particularly generous compared to other countries in Europe, where, after five years, you're effectively automatically settled in this country. We will change that,"" Mahmood told Sky News on Sunday.

She added that under the changes, a refugee's status would be reviewed every 2½ years, during ""a much longer path to permanent settlement in this country of 20 years.""

Mahmood said she would provide further details of the changes on Monday, including an announcement on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.

The government has said it wants to stay in the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR) but change how the Article 8 provision, covering the right to a family life, is interpreted.

Mahmood said it was being ""applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country.""

The government's tougher approach has drawn criticism. More than 100 British charities wrote to Mahmood urging her to ""end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm,"" saying such steps are fueling racism and violence.

Polls suggest immigration has overtaken the economy as British voters' top concern. Over the summer, protests took place outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.

A total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the U.K. in the year ending March 2025, a 17 per cent rise on the previous year and six per cent above the 2002 peak of 103,081.

Mahmood said the government would look to open more ""safe and legal"" routes for asylum seekers, as she believed Britain should play its part in helping those fleeing danger.

Looking to European countries

The Home Office said its reforms would look to ""match and in some areas exceed"" the standards of Denmark and other European countries, where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration in society is expected.

Asylum seekers are granted temporary residence permits under Denmark's approach, usually for two years, and they must reapply when these expire. They can be repatriated if their home country is deemed safe, and the path to citizenship has also been lengthened.

The Home Office said Denmark's more restrictive immigration policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the deportation of 95 per cent of rejected applicants.

Denmark's reforms, implemented while it remains a signatory to the ECHR, have drawn sharp criticism. Rights groups say the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged limbo.

Britain's Refugee Council said on X that refugees do not compare asylum systems while fleeing danger, and that they come to the U.K. because of family ties, some knowledge of English or existing connections that help them start anew safely.",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-16 12:57:18.499903

This is the latest city to unwillingly receive federal agents in President Donald Trump’s illegal immigration crackdown.

The federal government hasn’t provided a full explanation for why this began or how many people have been detained, but DHS blamed the operation in Democratic-led Charlotte on state officials, saying illegal immigrants fled there because of sanctuary policies they believed would protect them.

A DHS press release included a list of migrants the agency called “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” who they say were released onto North Carolina streets because of those policies.

The department has not linked the operation to any single event. However, the fatal stabbing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian on Charlotte’s light rail train has brought heightened national attention to the city in recent months, although the suspect was an American.

Amid the recent enforcement, a Honduran-born United States citizen, Willy Aceituno, was pulled from his vehicle by agents after they smashed his window. He was later released without charges.

“When you have fentanyl being trafficked in cities, when you have Charlotte, North Carolina, a hub of human trafficking, what better tool to put on the ground than the people who are tasked with federal law enforcement in doing exactly what they’re doing,” said Republican Chairman Addul Ali, who represents North Carolina’s 12th congressional district, on NewsNation Saturday.

DHS has not said how long the operation will last, but it comes as federal agents are pulling out of Chicago.

Across the city this weekend, the mood has shifted from confusion to fear. City and county leaders have called the federal raids unnecessary, saying they’re creating panic, not promoting safety.

Immigrant-owned stores shut down, streets were quiet and people avoided daily tasks out of fear they could be targeted.

Migrants granted temporary asylum will no longer be able to automatically and unconditionally bring their spouses or children to the UK.
Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, the Home Secretary denied that the crackdown – which also scraps automatic state handouts to thousands of asylum seekers – was “racist”.
Challenged by Sky presenter Trevor Phillips that Labour had been “panicked” into a “racist” immigration policy, Ms Mahmood said: “I reject that entirely.
The Home Secretary will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances of £49 a week.","Refugees will be barred from bringing their families to the UK unless they can show that they are earning enough to pay for their upkeep without claiming benefits.

Shabana Mahmood will end the current automatic right for successful asylum seekers to bring their spouses and children to the country, irrespective of their earnings.

The moves – to be announced on Monday – are part of the Home Secretary’s overhaul of the asylum system, which will force refugees who enter the UK illegally to wait 20 years before they can apply for permanent settlement.

Ms Mahmood will end what she claims is the “golden ticket” of Britain’s “excessively generous” immigration system, which currently guarantees migrants permanent residency and unconditional access to benefits after they have spent five years in the UK.

She will tell MPs that refugee status will become temporary and reviewed every 30 months. If an asylum seeker’s country is deemed safe at any time, they will be immediately returned.

Migrants granted temporary asylum will no longer be able to automatically and unconditionally bring their spouses or children to the UK.

They will only be allowed to do so if they meet the same financial conditions and standards of English as Britons or migrants on skilled work visas. Britons seeking to bring partners to the UK have to show a combined income of £29,000.

They will also only be entitled to permanent settlement if they meet the same conditions as other migrants, including being in work and paying NI, not claiming benefits, a spotless criminal record, a high standard of English and contribution to British society.

Under the present system, introduced by the last Labour government in 2005, refugees can apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after five years, providing them with access to benefits and public funds and a route to citizenship.

Under new legislation, migrants who arrive illegally either on small boats across the Channel or in lorries, or those who overstay their visas and then claim asylum, will instead have to wait 20 years to secure permanent settlement.

There will be some alternative routes for skilled refugees, enabling them to reduce the 20-year qualification by going into specified work or study routes.

Ms Mahmood will also create shorter, 10-year pathways to permanent settlement for genuine refugees who arrive in the UK legally via three new “safe and legal” routes. These will be designed for asylum seekers who are seeking to work or study in Britain or, like the Homes for Ukraine scheme, are sponsored by local UK communities.

Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, the Home Secretary denied that the crackdown – which also scraps automatic state handouts to thousands of asylum seekers – was “racist”.

Challenged by Sky presenter Trevor Phillips that Labour had been “panicked” into a “racist” immigration policy, Ms Mahmood said: “I reject that entirely. I am the child of immigrants. My parents came to this country legally in the late 60s and the early 70s. This is a moral mission for me.

“I can see that illegal migration is creating division across our country. I can see that it is polarising communities across the country. I can see that it is dividing people and making them estranged from one another. I don’t want to stand back and watch that happen in my country.

“What is happening with our illegal migration system is this is a broken system. It’s not Right-wing talking points or fake news or misinformation that is suggesting that we’ve got a problem. I know because I have now seen this system inside out. It is a broken system. We have a genuine problem to fix.”

Ms Mahmood previously branded Nigel Farage “worse than racist” after the Reform UK leader said he would reassess the migration status of people already granted the right to settle in Britain. Speaking in September, she said Mr Farage had “blown a very, very loud dog whistle to every racist in the country”.

The reforms, hailed as the biggest overhaul since the Second World War, are modelled on Denmark, which has reduced the number of asylum applications to a 40-year low, with 95 per cent of applicants rejected.

High-achieving refugees could bring forward their 20-year qualification date but sources said a refugee who arrived illegally would still face a “penalty” delay even if they were a doctor earning £100,000 a year.

The Home Office is also devising three capped routes for genuine refugees. One would enable talented refugees to come to the UK to study, a second would be for skilled asylum seekers to work in Britain and a third would enable voluntary and community organisations to sponsor refugees.

“I’m sending a clear signal to people: Do not get on a boat. Do not seek to come into this country illegally. That pathway is much more difficult,” said Ms Mahmood.

The Home Secretary will also revoke the statutory duty to provide support for asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances of £49 a week.

Under the changes, the support will be removed from those who have a right to work and can support themselves but choose not to do so. Those who break the law will also face their support being withdrawn. There are currently an estimated 8,500 people in asylum accommodation on visas with the right to work.

Ms Mahmood said: “Just under 10 per cent of the people that are currently in asylum accommodation, primarily in hotels, but also in housing as well across the country, have the right to work.

“At the moment, there is no expectation that despite having that right to work, that those individuals do, in fact, find work and support themselves. There is also no expectation that people have to obey rules in order to retain their asylum accommodation.

“There’s also no expectation that if you break the law of this country, you will lose your accommodation. That actually places those individuals in a better position than most British citizens in social housing in this country.”

Other changes expected to be announced on Monday include requiring judges to prioritise public safety over migrants’ rights to a family life, or the risk that they will face “inhuman” treatment if returned to their home country.

Some 39,075 people have arrived in the UK after making the journey so far this year, according to the latest Home Office figures.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, described the Government’s plans as “very small steps in the right direction with a few gimmicks”. He claimed that the Government would make little progress in reducing illegal migration without quitting the European Convention on Human Rights.

He told Sky News: “We want no illegal immigration whatsoever. We need to have a cap on legal inward migration each year, so the numbers are very, very dramatically lower.”

Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “These harsh and unnecessary plans won’t deter people who have been persecuted, tortured or seen family members killed in brutal wars. Instead, they are more likely to force them into destitution and sleeping rough on the streets.”

“We see every day in our services how refugees go on to contribute as doctors, nurses, carers, entrepreneurs and valued members of their communities, but some will need an initial safety net to get to that point.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/11/16/TELEMMGLPICT000449323813_17632917818220_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqbFS4ctvTRCv11iMWUZHtVhhEnL4rsjDuMz0rfzZf-J8.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-11-16 12:57:29.447809

""We thought church was safe and nothing [was] gonna happen,"" a 15-year-old witness told the newspaper.

Officials said there are ""a number of organisations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters"".

The DHS said they are carrying out the operation because North Carolina has not honoured the nearly 1,400 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees - meaning they had been released due to ""sanctuary policies"".

Charlotte is not a sanctuary city - cities that have policies in place to limit the assistance given to federal immigration authorities - but it is a ""certified welcoming city"". This is a formal designation for cities that are committed to immigration inclusion.

""President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't,"" the DHS said.

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ‘I’m an American citizen,’” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.

“Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,’” Asciutto said.

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

“This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

“It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

“Half an hour later, he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

“This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.”

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We’re brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don’t know how long this is going to last.”

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”

“Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Why it matters: The high-profile operations have led to surges in arrests. But they've also galvanized local resistance efforts, and created a playbook for activists in other cities when ICE comes to town.

""In Chicago, we pushed back as hard as we could,"" said Brandon Lee, of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

""We're going to work to make sure that the local leaders in North Carolina and wherever else they take their road show of terror after this are as prepared as can be for what's coming.""

The big picture: Operation Midway Blitz, which targeted undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, resulted in 3,000 arrests, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Oct. 30.

The operation in Chicago mirrored prior activities in Los Angeles, where Border Patrol also joined ICE on its mission.

President Trump told ""60 Minutes"" in a recent interview that he wants to see more aggressive tactics in operations across the country, but blamed ""liberal judges"" for restricting immigration agents.

White House Deputy Chief of staff Stephen Miller set a 3,000 arrests per day goal in May. The latest public data shows that even with these targeted operations, the agency is falling short.

Zoom in: In Chicago, activists set up a rapid response team of volunteers, and rallied support from local elected officials, business and faith leaders.

Documenting enforcement: Part of the rapid response volunteer network's role was to film officers making arrests, so they could document any potential excessive uses of force or other violations.

Targeted demonstrations: At least one demonstration blocked the entrance at the Broadview processing facility that was holding immigrants for extended periods of time before they were transferred to permanent detention facilities.

Legal challenges: In the court room, litigators sued the administration over the use of tear gas in the city, the detention conditions at Broadview and for how federal agents made arrests. One case, over warrantless arrests, led to a judge ordering the release of more than 600 people on bond.

Between the lines: Sanctuary cities and jurisdictions are top targets for the immigration crackdown, White House Border Czar Tom Homan has said in multiple interviews.

But resistance to these raids is growing beyond activists and civil rights lawyers. Local business leaders and clergy have joined in calls to halt the aggressive enforcement tactics.

""At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

What's next: ""What we've seen in Los Angeles, what we've seen in Chicago are forces violating people's constitutional rights and wrecking havoc on entire communities,"" said Liz Barber, director of policy and advocacy at the ACLU of North Carolina.

President Donald Trump's administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina's largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration's strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here’s what to know:

Why send agents to Charlotte?

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina's two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections.

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

How have locals reacted?

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

Is the National Guard involved?

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina's congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor's office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

Several state lawmakers joined CASA members in Baltimore on Friday to introduce legislation that they say will protect immigrant families.

Maryland counties opted to let ICE collaborate with local law enforcement

In the last eight months, five new Maryland counties have opted in to the 287(g) program that allows collaboration between ICE and local law enforcement.

The new legislation would prevent that, meaning local resources will not be allowed to be used as an extension of ICE if it becomes law.

One Marylander and a member of CASA says the government is being used as a weapon against immigrant communities.

""Where infants are being ripped away from their parents and torn to the side, leaving them behind and grappling with the trauma, ICE is manufacturing a crisis in our communities and that is impacting the lives of thousands of Marylanders,"" said CASA Baltimore and Central Maryland Director, Crisaly De Los Santos.

The new legislation is through the launch of the Brave of Us campaign, which is calling on leadership in the state to help protect immigrants against what they call an authoritarian regime.

""DHS will not be deterred""

While Baltimore County has not opted into the collaboration program, it did recently sign a memorandum of understanding with ICE.

In a statement to WJZ in response to the legislation, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, called out state democrats:

Legal experts say that the BBC could show that Trump was not harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.
If Trump sues in Florida, he would need to establish that the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.","Donald Trump has followed through on his threat to sue the BBC over an edited speech despite the corporation's apology.

Although the BBC apologised and retracted the episode, it refused to compensate Trump, who claims the edited version of a 2021 speech broadcast by Panorama caused him major financial and reputational harm. He intends to seek $1–5 billion in damages.

The prospect of a multi-billion-pound lawsuit is a daunting one for the BBC and the British government, but the president faces legal hurdles on both sides of the Atlantic.

Why is Donald Trump suing?

The dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC’s flagship current affairs series Panorama, titled Trump: A Second Chance? broadcast days before the 2024 US presidential election.

The third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell"".

Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.

Trump’s demand that he be compensated for “overwhelming financial and reputational harm"".

What do the BBC say?

According to BBC News, the broadcaster set out five main arguments in its letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim.

It said the BBC did not distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels and was restricted on iPlayer to viewers in the UK; that the documentary did not cause Mr Trump harm as he was later re-elected; that the edit was not done with malice and was designed to shorten a long speech; that it was not meant to be considered in isolation but as part of an hour-long programme; and that an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.

Chairman Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation have written to the president’s legal team, strongly disagreeing that there was a basis for a defamation claim.

The broadcaster said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday.

Where could a case be heard?

Trump also said the lawsuit would “probably” be filed “someplace in the US”, but commented that litigation in the UK “moves a little bit quickly”.

However, deadlines to bring the case in English courts, where defamation damages rarely exceed £100,000, expired more than a year ago.

While Florida law has a two-year limit, bringing a defamation case in America will mean Trump faces a tougher legal standard.

What would Trump need to prove?

Trump would need to prove three major components - that the content published was factually false in a defamatory way; that he suffered harm due to the false and defamatory coverage; and that the media organisation knew it was false and acted with ""actual malice"".

Legal experts say that the BBC could show that Trump was not harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.

If Trump sues in Florida, he would need to establish that the BBC Panorama documentary was available there.

Because the documentary was not shown in the US, it would be hard to show that Americans thought less of the president because of a programme they could not watch.

Mark Stephens, a solicitor at Howard Kennedy, said he thinks it is ""virtually impossible for Donald Trump to win against the BBC"".

It is ""virtually impossible"" for Trump to win against BBC, solicitor Mark Stephens tells ITV News

""Of course he can start a court case, but you've then got to have legal merit, you've got to have cogent evidence, and the programme just wasn't broadcast in America,"" he told ITV News.

""And for a libel claim to succeed even in America, harm must occur where the case is brought. So it's hard to argue reputational damage in a jurisdiction where the content wasn't aired.""

Mr Stephens added that even if a court in the US were to award a million dollars, British courts will only enforce compensatory damage for reputational loss.

He continued: ""And in this case, that's going to be no more than £100,000. So even if he gets a billion dollar judgement, it's not going to be enforced in the UK, and indeed it's not going to be economic to have brought the case.""

Trump's previous media wins

Although experts doubt the strength of his case, Trump has previously secured multimillion-dollar settlements from major US media companies, including Paramount and ABC News, over claims of misleading or inaccurate broadcasts.

He even told GB News he has had “a lot of success” litigating against news organisations.

In July, Paramount, which owns CBS, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump alleged that the interview was edited to enhance how Harris, the Democratic nominee for president in 2024, sounded.

Trump told GB News in an interview on Friday night: “I think that was worse than the Kamala (Harris) thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.”

That settlement came as the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission launched an investigation that threatened to complicate Paramount’s need for administration approval to merge with Skydance Media.

Last year, ABC News said it would pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos ’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. A jury found that he was liable for sexually abusing her.",https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/3w5WSaXT0LdQDvYkZ3QzxO/21e7edf9fdaf95c5fa1c863eadaff2db/trumpbbc.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80,N,,2025-11-16 09:56:27.765781

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said. ""I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.""

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

""I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,"" he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

Finally, he was allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Ali Faqirzada, 31, tapped out a message that he had passed a crucial screening, putting him on track to become a U.S. citizen.

An asylum official, he told them, had determined that he would be in danger if he returned to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where he had worked for U.S.-backed organizations and a group that supported women’s education.

But then came another text moments later: “They are detaining me.”

The circumstances of Mr. Faqirzada’s detainment by immigration officials have become increasingly common as President Trump uses more aggressive tactics to expel immigrants, including those like Mr. Faqirzada who have followed legal procedures to gain citizenship. While some immigration cases have been thrust into the limelight, tens of thousands of migrants have wound up in federal facilities and been quietly deported without their stories spilling into public view.

But Mr. Faqirzada’s detainment has led to a flurry of activity to free him, set in motion by two powerful New York institutions: Bard College and the Episcopal Diocese of New York.

Those involved see his case as particularly compelling. In their view, the country owes him for his work in Afghanistan. In the course of helping him, they say a kind of blueprint is emerging for trying to free detainees caught in the Trump administration’s crackdown: make the case visible, work every connection, don’t engage in partisan tactics.

While McLaughlin did not elaborate further on DHS's operation, the ""surge"" into Charlotte comes after federal agents have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland.","Department of Homeland Security agents are ""surging"" to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Saturday, Nov. 15, to ""ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" according to department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,"" said McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, in a statement emailed to USA TODAY on Nov. 15.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,"" McLaughlin said. ""There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won’t.”

The arrival of federal agents comes as President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown expands to more Democratic-run cities, including Charlotte, led by Democratic Mayor Vi Lyles.

In response to DHS's efforts, the city of Charlotte's government shared a statement on Nov. 15: ""The expected U.S. Customs and Border Protection's operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.""

Additionally, the city's government said in its statement that anyone who needs ""the police, don't hesitate to call 911. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department does not participate in Immigration and Customs Enforcement or U.S. Customs and Border Protection operations and is not involved in the planning or execution of any federal immigration enforcement activities.""

The city also asked community members who want to make their voices heard, ""do so peacefully,"" as local officials ""do not want to see violence like many witnessed in other cities.""

What is DHS doing in Charlotte?

Before the announced deployment, Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry L. McFadden said on Nov. 13 that federal officials had not disclosed any specific details about DHS's operation, including how many agents would be sent to the city or what their mission would entail. The sheriff added that his agency would not be ""involved with any measures regarding enforcement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP.""

Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, is a Democratic stronghold in a state that Trump won during last year's presidential election. In Mecklenburg County, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris received 66% of the vote while Trump won the state by four percentage points.

Lyles, in a Nov. 13 X post, said local officials didn't know what immigration authorities were planning to do in Charlotte, but she asked residents to remain calm.

""I understand this news will create uncertainty and anxiety for many people in our community,"" Lyles said on X. ""Everyone in our community deserves to feel secure and I am committed to doing all that I can to inform our community, help make sure everyone feels safe, and understands their rights.""

According to the Charlotte Observer, ""masked federal agents"" made their presence known Saturday, Nov. 15, including at a church in east Charlotte.

“Right now, everybody is scared. Everybody,” the church's pastor, who did not want to identify himself to the outlet, said. “One of these guys with immigration, he say he was going to arrest one of the other guys in the church. He pushed him.”

Which other cities have federal agents been deployed to?

While McLaughlin did not elaborate further on DHS's operation, the ""surge"" into Charlotte comes after federal agents have been deployed to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Memphis, Chicago and Portland. The deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops have been challenged in court and have drawn criticism over officers' use of force and what's been seen as increasingly aggressive tactics by the Trump administration.

Late last month, Trump threatened to send “more than the National Guard” to ""troubled"" U.S. cities. At the time, he didn't identify which cities he intended to send troops to.

“We’re sending in our National Guard and if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard because we’re going to have safe cities,” Trump said Oct. 28 at a U.S. naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, during his weeklong Asia trip. “We’re not going to have people killed in our cities. Whether people like that or not, that’s what we’re doing.""

While Lyles and other city officials are in opposition to the DHS's operation, Congressman Tim Moore, a Republican who represents a district outside Charlotte, said he has ""full confidence in our federal law enforcement partners and appreciates their ongoing work to uphold the rule of law and protect the people of North Carolina.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/15/USAT/87296915007-20251017-t-234555-z-1343128707-rc-2-d-4-haghq-9-s-rtrmadp-3-usaicechicago.JPG?crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&width=2975&height=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-16 00:56:32.593659

The statement from BCSO comes after Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer released a statement saying that Asheville 'may be a targeted city'.

Manheimer's statement on ICE and Border Patrol referenced Governor Josh Stein's statement talking about the possibility of ICE and Border Patrol agents coming to North Carolina, saying in part, ""As this situation develops, I will continue to stay in touch with local and state officials to keep people safe, respect the rule of law, and support our people.""

""A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,'” Falk explained to Al-Jazeera in a Saturday interview from Ottawa in the wake of the incident that happened at the international airport in Toronto ahead of the scheduled event.
He told media outlets that he and his wife, also an American, were held for over four hours after their arrival in Toronto.
Clearly, the international repression of the Palestinian cause knows no bounds.""
Canadian Senator Yuen Pau Woo, a supporter of the Palestine Tribunal, told Al-Jazeera he was “appalled” by the interrogation.","Ninety-five-year-old Richard Falk—world renowned scholar of international law and former UN special rapporteur focused on Palestinian rights—was detained and interrogated for several hours along with his wife, legal scholar Hilal Elver, as the pair entered Canada for a conference focused on that nation's complicity with Israel's genocide in Gaza.

""A security person came and said, ‘We’ve detained you both because we’re concerned that you pose a national security threat to Canada,'” Falk explained to Al-Jazeera in a Saturday interview from Ottawa in the wake of the incident that happened at the international airport in Toronto ahead of the scheduled event.

“It was my first experience of this sort–ever–in my life,” said Falk, professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, author or editor of more than 20 books, and formerly the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories.

Falk, who is American, has been an outspoken critic of the foreign policy of Canada, the United States, and other Western nations on the subject of Israel-Palestine as well as other issues. He told media outlets that he and his wife, also an American, were held for over four hours after their arrival in Toronto. They were in the country to speak and participate at the Palestine Tribunal on Canadian Responsibility, an event scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Ottawa, the nation's capital.

The event, according to the program notes on the website, was designed to ""document the multiple ways that Canadian entities – including government bodies, corporations, universities, charities, media, and other cultural institutions–have enabled and continue to enable the settler colonization and genocide of Palestinians, and to articulate what justice and reparations would require.""

In his comments to Al-Jazeera, Falk said he believes the interrogation by the Canadian authorities—which he described as ""nothing particularly aggressive"" but ""random"" and ""disorganized"" in its execution—is part of a global effort by powerful nations complicit with human rights abuses and violations of international law to “punish those who endeavour to tell the truth about what is happening” in the world, including in Gaza.

Martin Shaw, a British sociologist and author of The New Age of Genocide, said the treatment of Falk and Elver should be seen as an ""extraordinary development"" for Canada, and not in a good way. For a nation that likes to think of itself as a ""supporter of international justice,"" said Shaw, ""to arrest the veteran scholar and former UN rapporteur Richard Falk while he is attending a Gaza tribunal. Clearly, the international repression of the Palestinian cause knows no bounds.""

It remains unclear how DHS' departure from Naval Station Great Lakes will impact the ongoing immigration crackdown.

In recent days, there have been signs the federal immigration surge may be slowing down in Chicago.

Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino left the city, and on Saturday, federal officials confirmed immigration enforcement had begun in Charlotte, North Carolina.

In an interview on Fox News on Thursday, the Border Patrol commander said he was in West Virginia.

Two days ahead of Bovino's departure from Chicago, a spokesperson challenged reporting from multiple outlets that he and numerous federal agents were preparing to leave the city.

Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for Homeland Security, disputed reports that operations would be wound down in Chicago in a social media post.

“We aren’t leaving Chicago,” she said, not referring to Bovino by name. She made similar remarks on Fox News Tuesday.

McLaughlin cited statistics showing crime had decreased in the city during the ramped-up federal intervention, but it was unclear how those statistics were calculated.

She reported the following since the start of Operation Midway Blitz:

Homicides down 16%

Shootings down 35%

Robberies down 41%

Carjackings down 48%

Transit crime down 20%

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office blasted the statistics cited by McLaughlin in her social media post, calling the assertion that DHS has helped lower crime rates “a slap in the face” to Chicago police.

According to data provided by Chicago police, homicides were down 29% year-over-year in the city. Robberies were down 35% year-over-year, motor vehicle thefts dropped by 23%, and shootings decreased by 36%.

Thousands of arrests were reported during the federal operation in Chicago, which has sparked multiple court challenges.

What are they (Border Patrol) here for?”","Following the arrival of the U.S. Border Patrol in Charlotte Saturday morning, hundreds of protesters gathered at First Ward Park in the afternoon and marched through uptown, delivering a clear message to federal agents: “Get out.”

Rosa Ramirez attended the emergency protest with her mother, Martha Ramirez, who held a sign saying, “Stop kidnapping our neighbors.” There have been many reports around the Charlotte region of federal police — their identities shielded with masks and license plates covered — detaining people.

“They’ve been doing terrible things in Chicago, and we’re not happy that they’re bringing it here to North Carolina,” Martha Ramirez said.

As the daughter of a father from the Dominican Republic, Rosa Ramirez said she feels that the immigrant community is being racially profiled, especially after hearing about a U.S. citizen in Charlotte who was pulled out of his truck after agents broke the window.

“None of us have any real feeling of safety,” Rosa Ramirez said. “I’m here to use my voice and to use the rights that I hopefully still have to defend those who don’t have their papers and documents at this moment.”

The U.S. Border Patrol has not disclosed how many agents were sent from Chicago to the city, nor how long they intend to remain. Their activities began in the morning, but it’s unclear which federal other agencies are involved in this operation.

In recent developments, at least 200 U.S. Border Patrol agents were stationed in Chicago, assisting the Trump Administration’s efforts to address illegal immigration.

Since September, the agency reports arresting 1,500 individuals, according to CBS News. Federal agents have made arrests across Chicago and surrounding suburbs, questioning residents and, at times, using tear gas on both civilians and local law enforcement.

“Immigrants are an integral part of our community and our workforce,” Martha Ramirez said, noting labor needs and contributions such as helping western North Carolina rebuild after Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters. She said she believes migration is a human right.

“We should be welcoming those folks here, and those folks aren’t asking for anything but the privilege to work and to contribute to our economy in the same way that any other American citizen does,” she said.

Community organizations led protesters with loud chants against Border Patrol agents being in Charlotte. Some of the participating organizations included Seeking Justice, Poor People’s Campaign, Housing Justice Coalition, Blakk Liberation, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation.

Kass Ottley of Seeking Justice said she liked seeing the large crowd but encouraged more people in the region to get involved and push racial differences aside.

“We have to come together,” she said. “That’s the only way we’re going to win.”

Joel Simpson of the Poor People’s Campaign spoke against the Trump Administration’s budget boosts for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said that money could go towards other needs, such as healthcare or food programs to help people.

“We know that this is an attack on people’s dignity and humanity,” Simpson said. “It’s an attack on our constitutional rights, and we won’t be silent about it.”

Alison Yanez and her sister, Danna Yanez, said they’re not going to be quiet either. Their family came to America from Honduras for a better life.

“I feel bad for the families that fear coming out to the streets and speaking for themselves,” Alison Yanez said. “I’m here today to speak for those who can’t.”

“They’re just grabbing people out of their cars ... they’re just harassing them,” Danna Yanez said about the treatment. “But we’re all humans, and we’re all on stolen land.

Federal agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection are expected to arrive in the Charlotte area within days, local officials confirmed this week amid growing friction between Washington’s immigration enforcement priorities and Democratic-run cities.

The Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday that it had been notified of the impending federal presence but emphasized that it has not been asked to assist or participate in any operations. A department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday that the sheriff’s office had ""zero involvement or participation in any CBP immigration enforcements or operations.""

The impending immigration enforcement in North Carolina comes as Sheriff Garry L. McFadden, a Democrat, has sought to maintain open communication with federal agencies while distancing his department from federal immigration enforcement.

GOP URGES DEMOCRAT GOVERNOR TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD TO CHARLOTTE AS CRIME SURGES

Charlotte’s anticipated CBP deployment is the latest in a series of similar moves by the federal government to extend border-security operations to other parts of the country.

In recent months, CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have sent personnel to major metropolitan areas including Chicago and Washington, D.C.

Those operations have sparked protests from anti-immigration activists. In Portland, Oregon, protests have flared since June. Anti-ICE graffiti has been scrawled outside of detention centers, and demonstrations have become violent at times between protesters and federal agents.

WATCH: Federal immigration agents dodge bullets, speeding cars in CA

Federal officials have described the deployments as part of an expanded effort to disrupt smuggling networks and track illegal aliens.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations.""

Local pressures mount

The timing of the announcement comes as Charlotte faces intensifying scrutiny over violent crime.

Homicides and aggravated assaults have risen sharply this year, prompting Republican lawmakers to urge Democratic Gov. Josh Stein to deploy the National Guard. For now, the governor has resisted that call from Republican lawmakers, and local officials have argued that public safety remains a local responsibility.

""Recently, the city faced eight homicides in seven days. The murder rate in uptown Charlotte is now 200% higher than it was a year ago,"" a letter from a trio of Republican lawmakers said. ""According to the Fraternal Order of Police, aggravated assaults involving knives or guns have risen from 86 in 2024 to 111 in 2025, and personal strong-arm robberies have increased from 26 to 31 in the same period.""

MAJOR CITY POLICE UNIONS SUPPORT FEDERAL TROOP DEPLOYMENTS, BUT LOCAL LEADERS ARE PUSHING BACK

According to the Charlotte Police Department's quarterly statistics report, violent crimes, commercial burglaries and larcenies from automobiles have all gone up in Charlotte since last year. But other crimes like homicides, rapes, property crimes and arson have come down modestly from levels in 2024. In many categories, Charlotte’s current crime levels are meaningfully lower than rates in 2022 and 2023, with some exceptions.

On Aug. 22, the stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska garnered attention after her killing was captured on surveillance video while she was commuting home from her pizzeria job. The footage captured the 23-year-old cowering as her alleged killer leered over her with a folding knife seconds before the attack.

Police revealed that her accused killer was identified as Decarlos Brown Jr., a repeat offender with a lengthy rap sheet.

'Committed to transparency'

In his earlier statement Wednesday, McFadden sought to reassure residents that his office ""remains committed to transparency"" and that any coordination with federal agencies will be limited to information-sharing, not enforcement.

""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.""

""We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,"" the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw ""a lot of Latinos running,"" chased by ""a lot of Border Patrol agents.""

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,'"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the ""significant border patrol activity"" was seen Saturday.

""Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them 'fishing,'"" Asciutto said.

Encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton's front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

""This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we've got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They've broken no laws, and that's what concerns me,"" said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

""It's an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,"" the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

""Half an hour later, he's in our yard, he's working and Border Patrol rolls up,"" she said. ""They're here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there's just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.""

Some businesses close

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

""This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?"" he said. ""This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.""

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and ""We're brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don't know how long this is going to last.""

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials ""have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order"" and are ""demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.""

""Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. ""Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.""

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any ""inappropriate behavior"" and notify local law enforcement.

Home secretary Shabana Mahmood will indicate a move away from EU law as she announces plans to scrap the UK’s statutory duty to provide support to asylum seekers – with migrants also facing stricter requirements to receive and retain benefits.

It is part of a major overhaul of the immigration system, inspired by the Danish model, and comes as Labour battles to restore public trust in the asylum system to see off the threat of a Reform UK government. But Ms Mahmood may face objections from some Labour backbenchers, with immigration reform seen as a divisive issue within the party.

Ahead of a speech by the home secretary laying out the reforms on Monday, the Home Office said that support will “no longer be a given” for asylum seekers, vowing that automatic handouts for those seeking refuge “will end”.

The announcement is being billed by the government as the largest overhaul of asylum policy in modern times and a move to “restore order” to the rules.

Ministers hope it will reduce the incentive for small boat migrants to claim refuge in the UK, with Home Office officials insisting Britain will no longer be a “magnet for illegal migrants” seeking to benefit.

Outlining her changes, Ms Mahmood said the “pace and scale of migration” is putting “immense pressure” on communities.

She said: “This country has a proud tradition of welcoming those fleeing danger, but our generosity is drawing illegal migrants across the channel.

“The pace and scale of migration is placing immense pressure on communities.

“This week I will set out the most sweeping changes to our asylum system in a generation. We will restore order and control to our borders.”

The legal duty to provide asylum-seeking support was introduced in the UK in 2005 under EU law.

Currently, support includes the right to somewhere to live, as well as a weekly payment of £49.18 per person in each household to cover costs of items such as food, clothing and toiletries. If the accommodation provides meals, each person gets £9.95 per week instead. There are small increases for pregnant women and young children.

Under Ms Mahmood’s plans, those who can work, have assets, fail to comply with removal directions, engage in criminality, disrupt accommodation settings or work illegally could have their support removed, the Home Office said.

The changes are set to apply to people who are already in the asylum support system, as well as anybody who arrives and applies in the future – meaning those already in the UK could have their support taken away.

Meanwhile, officials have also said that taxpayer-funded benefits will be prioritised for people who are “making a contribution to the economy and communities”.

Among the changes expected to be unveiled on Monday is a move requiring judges to prioritise public safety over a migrant’s right to a family life, as well as a push to scrap permanent asylum in Britain.

Under current rules, those granted refugee status can apply for indefinite leave to remain and have refugee status for five years. But, under the expected proposals, refugees will be removed as soon as their home country is deemed safe.

It comes after officials in the Home Office visited Copenhagen as part of their attempts to learn about Denmark’s asylum policy, where a strict asylum approach has been taken by a government with similar political alignment to the Labour Party.

The country is also a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been criticised in the past for blocking or slowing efforts to deport illegal migrants.

The Scandinavian country has reduced the number of asylum applications to their lowest level in 40 years, and removed 95 per cent of rejected asylum seekers, according to the Home Office.

The Tories have said that some of the new measures are “welcome” but they “stop well short of what is really required and some are just yet more gimmicks – like the previous ‘smash the gangs’ gimmick”.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: “The truth is this Labour government is incapable of getting any real change past their left-wing backbenchers, especially after the weak example they set with the debacle of their botched welfare reforms.”

Labour is coming under pressure on immigration as Reform’s poll numbers continue to surge.

Nigel Farage’s party is sitting at 26 per cent in the latest YouGov Westminster voting intention figures from this week, with Labour lagging behind on 19 per cent, just ahead of the Tories on 18 per cent.

This is the latest in a series of crackdowns, including the immigration white paper earlier this year, designed to slash legal migration.

Under those plans announced in May, legal migrants will have to spend 10 years in the UK before applying for citizenship, and language requirements will be upped for all routed into the UK.

The number of asylum applications in the UK is at a record high, as the latest Home Office figures show 111,084 people applied for asylum in the year to June 2025.

This is the highest number for any 12 months since records began in 2001.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/15/17/PA-82143799.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-11-15 19:56:49.428217

The risks to America’s global pre-eminence get less attention than Trump’s White House ballroom, the government shutdown and his ugly statements about his opponents.","What’s the secret formula that has made the United States the dominant superpower in the world today?

I’d point to three fundamental ingredients, each of which is now being weakened. When I think of the historical legacies of our generation and of President Trump, I wonder if they will be less about the political battles in the headlines and more about the slow shriveling of America’s global standing.

Patriotism is less about waving flags and more about defending these three forces that over two centuries have made America pre-eminent:

A commitment to education at every level, resulting in global leadership in science and technology.

I believe the answer to almost every question is education — the highest-return long-term investments are often in human capital. Yet throughout the ages there have always been those eager to execute Socrates, to subject Galileo to the Inquisition, to ban books.

America became the world’s leading nation largely because of its emphasis beginning in the 19th century on mass education when other countries educated only a sliver of elites, Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz argued in their landmark 2008 book, “The Race Between Education and Technology.”

The United States helped pioneer public elementary schools and widespread high school and college attendance; later, American research universities became global leaders and nurtured technology hubs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Thus the United States boasts the Magnificent Seven technology companies, while there isn’t anything comparable in Europe. America’s scientific and technological excellence arises in part because of a symbiotic partnership between universities, the federal agencies that fund research and the private companies that commercialize that knowledge.

America’s educational supremacy arguably began slipping decades ago, as some East Asian countries eclipsed us in high school graduation rates and in science and math skills among young people. But Trump is adding to the pressure by gutting the Department of Education, including research and data collection that show how we can improve outcomes. Even worse, he is waging war on America’s most eminent universities.

American excellence in science drives economic competitiveness and well-being. Yet Trump is winding down mRNA vaccine programs that are full of promise in tackling cancer and has slashed investments in medical research.

Any president should be proud of universities like Harvard and Columbia, not attempt to crush them. We stand up to China with not only aircraft carriers but, even more, by educating our own young people and leading in research in artificial intelligence, synthetic biology and materials science. Yet by some reckonings, China has already surpassed the United States in emerging technologies.

So we should be doing what we did after Sputnik in 1957, recommitting this country to science and education. Instead, the Trump administration’s hostility to great universities seems to reflect a larger scorn for science in fields from vaccines to climate change. It is the latest flowering of an anti-intellectualism that goes back to China’s first Qin emperor burying scholars alive and, in this country, to the Scopes trial, the Joseph McCarthy hysteria and the 2017 tax on university endowments.

An inclination toward free markets and free trade, supported by the rule of law.

This is the pillar that Trump is most respectful of. He mostly believes in capitalism and free markets — probably more than many Democrats — but has led a rapid retreat from free trade. His tariffs are the highest since the 1930s. Trump has also systematically chipped away at some of the underpinnings of a market economy. Markets thrive with prudent fiscal and monetary management, yet his tax cuts lead to soaring debt even as he tries to crush the independence of the Federal Reserve. Corruption is a bane of capitalism, yet his family has seemed to use the presidency as an A.T.M.

And the rule of law? England was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution partly because of a legal system that offered protection and predictability. In contrast, Trump has periodically defied lower courts and used the Department of Justice to punish his political opponents. Mark L. Wolf, a federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan, announced this month that he was resigning to be able to speak openly about the Trump administration’s “assault on the rule of law” and the way that it poses an “existential threat to democracy.”

Immigration and the absorption of some of the brightest minds from around the world.

My dad, an Armenian refugee from Eastern Europe, arrived in the United States in 1952. Soon after, his landlady returned his rent, saying, “I can’t take money from a refugee.”

Such a welcoming spirit, while far from consistently applied, has enormously enriched the United States. Four of the Magnificent Seven tech companies are led by immigrants, and 46 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, according to the American Immigration Council.

These three factors are not a complete recipe for America’s greatness. The sheer physical size of our domestic market helped, along with democracy and the ease of interstate commerce. And even on those three, we’ve repeatedly fallen short.

Yet I see these three factors as central to America’s rise as the world’s leading power today. And these strengths are now being systematically undermined, especially universities, trade, the rule of law and recruitment of the world’s best minds.

The risks to America’s global pre-eminence get less attention than Trump’s White House ballroom, the government shutdown and his ugly statements about his opponents. But I’d argue that his most important legacy may be the damage he is doing to the underpinnings of our economic engines.

The Nobel in economic science went this year to three scholars who illuminated how innovation drives economic growth. They emphasized that this arises from immigration, from great universities, from openness to the world and to ideas — and consequently warned of “dark clouds” ahead.

Throughout history, we’ve repeatedly seen how great nations sometimes lost their energy and drive, slipping because of what Jawaharlal Nehru described in the context of India as a “gradual oozing out of hope and vitality.” In the year 1000, the greatest city in the world was Kaifeng in China, then the most important country in the world — but China and Kaifeng then lost ground for most of the next millennium before reviving in recent decades.

The United States may or may not experience such decrepitude, but decline seems to me more likely if America chokes trade and immigration while stifling universities.

(AP/WNCN) — Federal officials confirmed that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city had begun as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations Saturday.

“We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Local officials, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

“We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” said the statement, which was also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Stephanie Sneed of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg education board.

The federal government hadn’t previously announced the push. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden confirmed earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino — a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte — said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in Border Patrol and ICE agents pulling people over since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. “I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and border patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.”

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

“I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,” he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ’I’m an American citizen,” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

Finally he was allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Local organizations responded by having trainings, trying to inform immigrants of their rights, and considering peaceful protests. President Donald Trump’s administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

But Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the “vast majority” of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.”

He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” they see and notify local law enforcement about it.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasized ahead of time that it isn’t involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Mayor of Charlotte Vi Lyles, Board of County Commissioners Chair Mark Jerrell, and Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education Chair Stephanie Sneed issued a combined statement amid reports the border patrol was focusing on Charlotte, according to WJZY.

Our organizations believe that our diversity makes us stronger. And with that belief we are unwavering in our commitment to a safe and welcoming community where everyone can grow and thrive. It is critical for all residents to feel secure in our community and know they can live their lives without being fearful while walking down the street, going to school, work or the grocery store.

The expected U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s (commonly called “Border Patrol”) operations are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty in our community as recent operations in other cities have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.

We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives, contributing to our larger community. Each of our organizations have made commitments to the people we serve to protect their rights and dignity. We are committed to following the law and to protecting the rights of all people who call Charlotte and Mecklenburg County home.

It is important for people to understand their rights. There are a number of organizations standing ready to assist individuals seeking legal guidance on immigration matters and if anyone has questions about their immigration status or rights, please reach out to those organizations.

If you need the police, don’t hesitate to call 911. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) does not participate in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operations and is not involved in the planning or execution of any federal immigration enforcement activities. We know many of you want to speak out and make your voices heard — and that’s your right.

We ask that, as a community, we do so peacefully. We do not want to see violence like many witnessed in other cities. We can stand up for what we believe in without resorting to violence. Our region has thrived and grown because our strength lies in our diversity and our collective commitment to each other and to this community. Let us all — no matter our political allegiance – stand together for all hard working and law-abiding families.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/11/AP25319730858059.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-15 19:57:03.187920

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Federal officials confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina’s largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”

Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement that they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

“We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics.

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials.

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.

“I told them, ‘I’m an American citizen,’” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn’t believe I was an American citizen.”

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

“Basically what we’re seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said.

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday.

“Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,’” Asciutto said.

An encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton’s front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

“This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we’ve got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They’ve broken no laws, and that’s what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

“It’s an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

“Half an hour later, he’s in our yard, he’s working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They’re here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there’s just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”

Some businesses close

JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

“This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.”

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We’re brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don’t know how long this is going to last.”

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”

“Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,"" Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park.

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

Participants said at least seven of those arrested were faith leaders from Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Unitarian Universalist and Jewish traditions.
Sinks said faith leaders began Nov. 14 with a multifaith service outside the Broadview facility to ""bear witness to the suffering inside the facility.""
Several faith leaders at the demonstration expressed shock at the intensity of the police response.
Faith leaders were brutalized today for wanting to offer spiritual care to their stolen neighbors.","In video recorded on Nov. 14 outside the embattled U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, the Rev. Michael Woolf stands alongside fellow protesters, fiddling awkwardly with his backpack as faith leaders and other protesters chant slogans at a line of police officers. A moment later, one officer can be seen walking forward, grabbing Woolf by the wrist and yanking.

Demonstrators attempted to hold on to Woolf, who was wearing a clerical collar, but four officers wrenched him from the crowd and tossed him to the ground. After turning him onto his stomach, officers proceeded to arrest Woolf, and removed him to the Cook County Sheriff's Office in Maywood, Illinois.

""I've got bruises all over my body,"" Woolf, an American Baptist minister who is pastor of Lake Street Church of Evanston, Illinois, told Religion News Service. He was speaking in his first interview since being released Nov. 14 afternoon after about seven hours in custody.

Woolf said when he asked the arresting officers to loosen the plastic handcuffs that were causing his hands to go numb, an officer replied: ""Nobody wants to talk to you — shut the f–k up.""

""It's part of the dehumanizing nature of it, and it gives me a lot of clarity around what's happening here,"" said Woolf, who has been active in protests against ICE. ""It's really a spiritual emergency.""

Footage and images of Woolf's arrest were shared widely on the Internet, drawing attention to the demonstration at the ICE facility, where protests have become commonplace in recent weeks. Organizers said at least 100 faith leaders of various faiths and denominations came to the Broadview facility, highlighting religious pushback to ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" a mass deportation effort that has rounded up hundreds of undocumented immigrants and other Chicago residents since it was launched in September.

Cook County Police said 21 people were arrested at the demonstration, all but one of whom were charged with ""Obstruction/Disorderly Conduct/Pedestrian Walking on Highways."" Participants said at least seven of those arrested were faith leaders from Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist, Unitarian Universalist and Jewish traditions.

The Department of Homeland Security did not reply immediately to a request for comment, but on Nov. 14 a post on the department’s X feed seemed to mock the protest participants, saying, ""Womp womp, cry all you want. These criminal illegal aliens aren't getting released,"" the post read.

The post called the demonstrators ""violent rioters"" and ""imbecilic morons"" who need to ""get a job.""

Asked about the DHS statement, Woolf said he and other protesters were ""demanding constitutional and due process rights"" for detainees, adding, ""I believe that justice will come in this life or the next.""

""I know which side I choose. I choose the Gospel,"" he added.

""This is our job,"" said the Rev. Kristina Sinks, a United Methodist pastor who helped organize a worship service, in reply to the DHS post. Sinks also rejected the suggestion that demonstrators were violent. She later explained via text message that she believes it is the job of clergy to ""advocate for the oppressed, the vulnerable, and those dehumanized by any forces of evil and oppression.""

Sinks added: ""Why does DHS feel threatened by clergy praying? What are they hiding?""

Organizers called the protest one of the largest in a series of demonstrations at the Broadview site, many of which have been led by religious leaders, who say that federal authorities are mistreating the detainees at the facility. The treatment of the detainees is the subject of an ongoing class-action lawsuit.

Sinks said faith leaders began Nov. 14 with a multifaith service outside the Broadview facility to ""bear witness to the suffering inside the facility."" The participants held daily hygiene products, bread and clean water to ""symbolize needs not met"" by the government agents who run the facility.

Faith leaders from various traditions — Christian, Jewish, Hindu and others — then presented police with a letter from clergy offering spiritual care to the detainees. Organizers, Sinks said, sent DHS an identical letter a week earlier.

Offers of pastoral care and Communion for detainees at the facility have been offered multiple times, only to be rebuffed. Religious leaders have raised the issue as a religious freedom concern. U.S. Catholic bishops on Nov. 12 approved a ""special pastoral message on immigration"" that expresses their collective solidarity with immigrants amid the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement tactics. On Nov. 4 Pope Leo XIV criticized immigration authorities who refused to let clergy administer Communion to migrants at the detention facility near Chicago.

After clergy were denied access again Nov. 14, video footage from the protest posted on social media showed Woolf and other faith leaders attempting to approach the facility, marching arm-in-arm. The demonstrators were quickly mobbed by police, who began pushing them back. A short time later, police began arresting demonstrators.

Several faith leaders at the demonstration expressed shock at the intensity of the police response. The Rev. Quincy Worthington, a Presbyterian Church (USA) minister who has been active in protests against ICE and was in the crowd Nov. 14, said he tried to help up people who had fallen or pushed down who were ""being crushed or beaten.""

Similarly, the Rev. Hannah Kardon, a United Methodist minister who had been thrown to the ground and arrested at a previous demonstration in Broadview, said in a text message that she saw ""overwhelming and unnecessary violence"" from ""multiple police forces"" at the facility.

""I saw knees on necks,"" she wrote. ""I saw people pulled and dragged. I saw people slammed to the ground. Faith leaders were brutalized today for wanting to offer spiritual care to their stolen neighbors. It was horrific.""

Clergy have been vocal critics of ""Operation Midway Blitz"" since it began and said they have repeatedly been met with force by federal, state and local police forces. At least five local clergy, including Woolf, Kardon and Worthington, say DHS forces have shot them with pepper balls. Footage of agents shooting the Rev. David Black, a Presbyterian minister from Chicago, in the head with pepper balls was widely shared on social media.

As state and local police have become the main force guarding the facility in recent weeks, activists have accused Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a critic of Trump and his mass deportation policies, of protecting ICE agents.

The treatment of faith-based protesters is part of the class-action lawsuit as well as a separate case that includes Black as a plaintiff. The latter case resulted in a temporary restraining order limiting federal agents' ability to use violence against protesters, including “religious practitioners.”

Woolf said that after he was arrested, he and other participants continued to pray and worship during the hours they were detained together. They sang songs such as ""We Shall Overcome,"" and some recited poetry.

The pastor added he has been reflecting on ""the dehumanizing nature"" of his experience, but that ""the cruelty that goes on [at] that facility … must be 100 times worse.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/11.15.25%20Rev%20Woolf%20arrested.png?h=a7f9be62&itok=37TSyw0-,N,,2025-11-15 20:57:50.016197

Great Lakes Naval Station was providing support for DHS operations in the Chicago area for the last two months or so, during which time federal immigration agents were engaged in Operation Midway Blitz.

DHS claimed on Friday that more than 4,000 undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the Chicago area during the operation.

City of North Chicago officials were informed of the closure late Friday afternoon, according to Gregory Jackson, the chief of staff to the city’s mayor.

A spokesperson for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the reported closure.

The backstory:

This comes as DHS has denied reports in recent days of it winding down Operation Midway Blitz and sending agents to other cities.

In response to a Chicago Tribune report that Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and his team were being reassigned, a DHS spokesperson said, ""We aren’t leaving Chicago.""

It’s unclear exactly what the command center’s closure means for immigration operations in the Chicago area more broadly.

Still, on Friday, The Associated Press reported that officials in Charlotte, North Carolina, were preparing for the arrival of Border Patrol agents and immigration sweeps.

In response to a North Carolina congresswoman's statement on her concern over Border Patrol coming to Charlotte, Bovino responded on X referring to operations in Chicago in the past tense.

Kupor said most of those additions have gone to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), noting that the agency’s rapid expansion has been one of the clearest indicators of the administration’s enforcement-driven approach.

The hiring surge is unfolding alongside the president’s broader effort to reshape the federal workforce, even as his administration moves to trim positions in other departments. “It’s about reshaping the workforce to focus on the priorities that we think are most important,” Kupor said.

Officials have carried out the buildup even as a hiring freeze and job cuts hit other corners of the federal bureaucracy, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.

Kupor noted that the workforce overhaul is far from over, saying in August that the administration anticipates trimming roughly 300,000 federal positions by the end of the year.

Earlier this year, Trump tapped billionaire Elon Musk to spearhead a sweeping downsizing initiative aimed at the 2.4-million-person civilian workforce. With the president’s support, Musk has argued that federal agencies have grown bloated and sluggish, and need a dramatic overhaul to function efficiently.

In practice, that restructuring has meant cuts across agencies responsible for civil rights enforcement, tax collection, and federal clean-energy initiatives, as the administration redirects resources toward its own priorities.

As the cuts accelerated, roughly 154,000 federal workers opted to take buyouts offered by the administration. Those departures stretched across agencies that handle everything from weather forecasting and food safety to public health programs and space operations, according to former officials and union representatives who spoke with Reuters earlier this year.

Overall, the combination of targeted hiring in security agencies and deep cuts across civilian departments has set the stage for a sweeping remake of the federal workforce. The administration maintains that shifting personnel toward border enforcement and defence will bolster national strength, but the breadth of reductions in everyday public functions has raised concerns among former officials and labor groups about lasting disruptions.

With tens of thousands taking buyouts and far more departures expected by year’s end, the government is undergoing an unusually rapid overhaul, supporters champion as long-needed reform and critics argue could hollow out essential operations. Whether agencies can adapt to these sharp changes, and whether the administration’s promised efficiencies materialize, will determine how well the federal government can meet the country’s needs in the years ahead.",https://americanbazaaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/US-ICE.png,N,,2025-11-15 17:57:07.251538

“Will the ICE agents be at school today?” her daughter, whose father is Indian, recently asked.","When Chris arrived at his childrens’ day-care center on November 5, he immediately sensed that something was wrong. There were more cars in the parking lot than usual, and when he walked into the Spanish immersion school, a visibly shocked parent told him that “ICE agents just came in and took Miss Diana.” Around 7 a.m. on Chicago’s North Side, Diana Santillana Galeano had been dragged out of Rayito de Sol and handcuffed in front of parents and their children. By the time Chris arrived 15 minutes later, many of the day-care workers were either crying or hiding, some in the classrooms and others in the back of a pickup truck, terrified that ICE officers might come back. Chris’s 3-year-old son held his hand and looked up at his father with a quivering lip. “Seeing your teachers cry is confusing,” he says. “His little sad face broke my heart.”

When Chris (who asked to use a pseudonym because of his job) called his wife, Erin, to tell her the news, she was shocked. Santillana Galeano is the kind of teacher who celebrates each child’s milestones, she says, and had been so excited when their 1-year-old son recently started to walk. Then came the detention. “In that moment, she went from being this person who is kind and nurturing,” she says, “to someone being handcuffed in front of her co-workers and treated like a threat.”

Local journalists showed up on the scene, and a few hours later, a video of the arrest shot by a parent was circulating on social media. In it, Santillana Galeano screams and says “I have papers” in Spanish as the ICE officers pin her against a car. Even though school officials showed the agents her employment documents, according to the Washington Post, Santillana Galeano was taken away to a detention center.

Santillana Galeano fled Colombia in 2023 owing to safety threats, according to legal filings. She filed for asylum and was granted employment authorization until November 2029. But the Department of Homeland Security argued that the Biden administration exploited a “loophole” to approve her work status and claimed she paid a smuggler to bring her teenagers across the border into Texas last year. Homeland Security also maintained that officers tried to pull her over at a traffic stop before she went into the day care. Under Biden, ICE agents weren’t allowed to enter schools in most scenarios, a policy that Trump reversed as part of his larger immigration crackdown. This summer, the government launched “Operation Midway Blitz” in the Chicago area, which has led to more than 3,000 arrests and a string of horrific stories, including ICE agents killing a man, pepper-spraying a 1-year-old girl, and throwing flash-bang grenades during a raid on an apartment building.

On the day of Santillana Galeano’s arrest, local lawmakers held a press conference to condemn ICE’s actions, and parents in the day care’s neighborhood, some of whom are lawyers, began to mobilize. “We dropped everything,” says Aimee Karstens, whose 16-month-old son goes to Rayito de Sol. “Everyone used whatever resources they had.” While the day care shut down for the rest of the week, a group of almost 30 mothers on a text thread called “Mami’s de Rayito” found Santillana Galeano legal support, set up a GoFundMe that has since raised close to $160,000, called local politicians, and coordinated a meal train for the other day-care workers who were frightened by their colleague’s arrest. (A few days later, a different group of moms from Chicago’s suburbs got arrested while protesting outside the detention facility where Santillana Galeano was being held.) The Rayito parents also scrambled for child care; one mother, who has an in-person job, said her husband took meetings while looking after their 4-month-old baby and letting their 4-year-old watch TV.

In between making T-shirts that say “No Hate, No Fear, Everyone Is Welcome Here” and organizing rallies, parents were figuring out how to talk with their children about what had happened. Over the weekend, after passing a tree decorated with lights, Erin’s 4-year-old son asked, “What if Miss Diana isn’t back in time for Christmas?” “He knows that ICE took Miss Diana, but his brain is still so tiny,” she says. “There’s no playbook for this.” She and the other moms are struggling to explain the incident to their kids. “There was a gun in my child’s school,” says Karstens. “It just unravels this feeling of security and safety and trust that you have.” She is now worried that her Spanish au pair could be arrested at day-care pickup or while playing in the park with her two sons. Another Rayito mom’s 4-year-old is already afraid of ICE agents and clutches her arm while walking around the neighborhood. “Will the ICE agents be at school today?” her daughter, whose father is Indian, recently asked. “Why are they arresting Latinos?” The mother tells her, “‘Your teacher will keep you safe. Mommy and Daddy will keep you safe.’ But I don’t even feel like I can promise that.”

Monday, the first day Rayito Del Sol opened its doors after the arrest, was an emotional one. Erin spoke with Santillana Galeano’s closest co-worker, who put on a smile for all of the children in spite of her red eyes. “I just instantly started crying because this is where it happened,” says Erin. “The teachers were brave enough to show up for our children.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdc/582/2cb94b5c6a0fb3c83ca8ac6aa1592e2c36-rayito-de-sol-2.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 18:56:46.644049

These factors are emboldening ICE agents and “things are escalating seemingly every day with many different people impacted,” he said.

I’m very proud of how community members, community organizers, and of course, my organizations have stood up in defense of our people.”","When the Supreme Court overturned a temporary restraining order in September that kept U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials from questioning and detaining people based on their language, skin color, or occupation — effectively clearing the way for racial profiling — Guadalupe Cardona was not surprised.

Cardona is a member of Unión del Barrio, a national organization that has led resistance efforts against ICE and police violence since its inception in 1981.

Since the Trump administration took office — but especially in recent months — she has witnessed daily scenes of ICE snatching primarily Latino people off the streets and detaining them without identifying themselves or giving due process. When the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to expand ICE’s use of racial profiling, Cardona knew it would empower ICE agents to ramp up their raids and kidnappings of community members even further.

“The communities that are being attacked are people who are keeping the world going, producing goods and foods, building things and providing services and doing all the things that are necessary in order for this nation to flourish and continue,” Cardona said.

To Reyna Montoya, founder and CEO of Aliento, an organization that works in Arizona to support immigrant families and Dreamers who came to the U.S. at a young age, the Supreme Court’s order greenlighting ICE’s racial profiling echoed a reality that people in her state had already lived through: the legalization of racial profiling by law enforcement in order to detain individuals they believed to be immigrants under SB 1070. During this time, from its implementation in 2010 to a settlement stripping several provisions in 2016, Black and Brown communities lived in fear, she said.

When it was passed in 2010, SB 1070 was one of the harshest anti-immigrant laws in the country. Among other measures, it deputized law enforcement to carry out immigration enforcement by determining the immigration status of anyone they deemed suspicious — even U.S. citizens. Montoya says the law also emboldened people who already had racist ideas. She recalled getting “dirty looks” while speaking Spanish at a supermarket with her mother.

In another instance, Montoya told Truthout, an intern who worked with Aliento at the time said that her father was pulled over, even though he was an authorized resident, because he was Brown. She also heard that people in Latino communities were not reporting crimes — from domestic violence to shoplifting — because they did not trust law enforcement.

“These were stories that I grew up listening to at that time,” 34-year-old Montoya said.

The impacts of legalized racial profiling rippled out to the mental health of Arizona’s young people. Cesar Escalante, a researcher at the University of Georgia, found that during the period SB 1070 was in place, youth in Arizona faced isolation, depression, anxiety, and eating disorders due to the stress of either being undocumented or being assumed to be undocumented.

“Young [Latino] people who went to school, especially middle school and high school … were subjected to a lot of ostracism, labeling, and bullying,” Escalante said.

However, communities mobilized against the law, holding protests and boycotts across Arizona. Two years after the measure passed, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to make it a crime if people failed to carry documentation to prove their immigration status and to outlaw police from arresting someone for believing them to be deportable. Further provisions to the law were stripped in 2016 when Arizona’s then attorney general banned law enforcement from prolonging a stop based on immigration status, although the rule about allowing law enforcement to inquire about immigration status still lingers.

Montoya is worried that history is repeating itself — only now it will be across the country, not just in Arizona.

“It is heartbreaking,” Montoya said. “Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be increased discrimination among the Latino community, among other communities that may appear to look Latino.”

“A Recipe for Disaster”

The Supreme Court’s decision to greenlight ICE’s racial profiling in September came in response to a lower court decision in California, Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, that attempted to ban the use of racial profiling and roving patrols of ICE agents to detain people. In response to an “emergency request” from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court issued a quick order that overturned the ban, allowing ICE agents to arrest anyone they might deem to be an immigrant based on their language or skin color, without identifying themselves. In legal circles, these are now dubbed “Kavanaugh stops” after the Supreme Court justice claimed that legal residents are only briefly stopped and not arrested, despite lawsuits proving otherwise.

As the American Immigration Council noted at that time: “Crucially, this order is not a final ruling, but it strongly signals the Supreme Court will not uphold strict constitutional limits on the authority of immigration agents to stop and question people they suspect to be immigrants.”

Jorge Loweree, managing director of programs and strategy at the American Immigration Council, said the Supreme Court’s recent decision is enormously consequential and could result in even more aggressive immigration raids across the country. Although he anticipates more litigation on this issue, the court’s decision could still take years to overturn — during which a lot of damage could be done, he said.

Since Donald Trump began his second term in office, more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by ICE, reporting from ProPublica has found; the government does not track the number of citizens held by immigration agents, so the count could well exceed that number. Loweree is concerned that the ruling could worsen this threat.

“If we live in an environment where ICE can target people based on the way that they look, including U.S. citizens, that’s a situation where no one in this country is safe from this sort of action,” Loweree said.

Loweree also noted that ICE is cutting corners during background checks of onboarding officers. These factors are emboldening ICE agents and “things are escalating seemingly every day with many different people impacted,” he said.

“All of this is a recipe for disaster, for some very ugly, negative outcomes impacting many people across the country, and it’s all something that was facilitated by the Supreme Court.”

“You’re Not Gonna Get Rid of Us”

Still, community members have been vigilant. Mario Nodal, creator of Unidos Podemos, a bilingual Instagram page, has spent the last months documenting ICE kidnappings and raids across the country by sharing crowd-sourced videos.

He said the ICE raids and Supreme Court ruling are very concerning. While Unidos Podemos originally started as a page to uplift Mexican American culture, it quickly turned into a platform to raise awareness about ICE activity after the Trump administration took office.

“People are just doing their job,” Nodal said. “They’re just out there doing what they need to do to survive, and ICE just pulls up on them, simply because of how they look and how they sound, and just takes them away. They don’t identify themselves. They don’t show their faces.”

Nodal said it is important to document the raids and their intensity. People have messaged him about families being separated, neighbors being profiled, and people being afraid to go to work or even leave their homes.

“It’s impossible to ignore what is happening,” Nodal said. “There are thousands of videos just showing abuse, discrimination, and just racial profiling.”

Nodal shares fundraiser campaigns of people who are impacted by ICE raids. He also said it is important to continue celebrating Latino culture and honoring the sacrifices that have been made to make a life in the U.S.

“In the midst of all of this, we’re still trying to push that culture, like Día de los Muertos, still trying to push it in front of people that don’t like us, people that hate us, like ‘We don’t care, you’re gonna see our culture, you’re gonna see who we are,’” Nodal said. “We’re still here. This is who we are, you’re not just gonna get rid of us.”

Cardona said her organization has also been proactive in fighting back against ICE activity. She said Unión del Barrio has been doing “know your rights” workshops and training people on how to spot ICE and report to the community when they do see them. Like Nodal, Cardona also said it is important to document ICE raids and kidnappings to help people understand what they have been seeing and the way ICE goes about these operations.

Advocates have also been organizing patrols and responding to reported ICE activity. Cardona said there have been many instances where community members in Los Angeles have been able to chase ICE agents away and prevent people from being detained.

“We know that less happens to people when there’s large numbers of community members, when the agents are outnumbered in large quantities,” Cardona said.

Unión del Barrio also encourages people not to walk on the street by themselves, to stay in large crowds, and to use their right to stay silent, so that it’s impossible to distinguish if there’s anyone in the group who’s undocumented.

“In this moment, there is a beautiful hope that exists in this solidarity and that people are standing up for what is right,” Cardona said. “There are people out there that care and that are organizing to defend rights, and that’s what they are — their rights. These are human rights and civil rights that are being infringed upon. I’m very proud of how community members, community organizers, and of course, my organizations have stood up in defense of our people.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2230414417-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 16:56:42.526724

Nada Radovan Tomanic, 53, of West Virginia, formerly of Hartford, served with the Zulfikar Special Unit of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s, during the armed conflict in the region, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Connecticut. Officials allege that Tomanic participated in the physical and psychological abuse of Bosnian Serb civilian prisoners.

“The defendant obtained the privileges of U.S. citizenship through lies and deceit, concealing the violent crimes she committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “The Department is fully committed to holding accountable those who exploit our immigration system and pose a threat to public safety.”

“Covering up past human rights abuses to attain U.S. citizenship is an egregious offense, and I thank our law enforcement partners both here in the U.S. and in Bosnia and Herzegovina for investigating this matter to ensure that justice is done,” said U.S. Attorney David Sullivan for the District of Connecticut.

When applying for U.S. naturalization in 2012, officials say Tomanic falsely denied having served in a detention facility or in any other situation involving the detention of others, officials said.

“Individuals who lie on their naturalization documents undermine the process for all who justly apply to be a part of our great nation,” said FBI special agent in charge P.J. O’Brien of the FBI.

“Tomanic’s admissions of fraud are detestable because of her history of targeting people based on their ethnicity and religion.

Tomanic pleaded guilty to procuring citizenship contrary to law.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in October in favor of the Trump administration's move to revoke the protection, ruling that left roughly 350,000 Venezuelans immediately at risk of deportation, while protections for an additional 250,000 expired November 7.
In a statement, the coalition said that Venezuelans ""did not emigrate by choice"" but because ""it was the only way to safeguard the lives, well-being, and futures of their families.""

The group said Venezuelans abroad should not be criminalized, adding: ""Being Venezuelan is not a crime.","Venezuela's main opposition coalition, Plataforma Unitaria Democrática (PUD), warned Sunday that the recent termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the United States leaves an estimated 600,000 Venezuelans vulnerable to detention and deportation and urged the Trump administration to offer a different protection channel for them.

TPS protected Venezuelans who fled the country's prolonged crisis and had been residing in the U.S. since 2021. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in October in favor of the Trump administration's move to revoke the protection, ruling that left roughly 350,000 Venezuelans immediately at risk of deportation, while protections for an additional 250,000 expired November 7.

In a statement, the coalition said that Venezuelans ""did not emigrate by choice"" but because ""it was the only way to safeguard the lives, well-being, and futures of their families."" It described TPS not as a privilege, but as a measure that allowed families to ""live with stability, work legally, and rebuild their lives while Venezuela fights to recover its democracy.""

The group urged U.S. authorities to review the decision and develop a mechanism guaranteeing lawful presence, particularly for those who ""have demonstrated themselves to be exemplary residents in the communities where they live."" Ending the program without an alternative ""generates unjust and unnecessary uncertainty,"" it said.

Opposition figures Edmundo González Urrutia and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado had previously shared a similar position on Friday, saying they had appealed directly to both the Trump administration and Congress. ""We work day and night to achieve from U.S. authorities a review of the case and the issuance of a status that protects them,"" they said in a joint statement.

""Being Venezuelan must never again be synonymous with being a refugee,"" their statement continued. They argued that the long-term solution is political change inside Venezuela, asserting that ""the greatest protection is to recover freedom, restore the value of the passport, and have a democratic government that defends its people.""

Most of the others were deported, and their criminal histories were not presented in Friday's disclosure.
The consent decree at issue, known as the Castañon-Nava settlement agreement, restricts the ability of ICE agents or others working with them to make warrantless arrests in Illinois.
“It seems highly likely to me that at least some of those individuals are among the 615 detainees who are not subject to mandatory detention,” Cummings said.
On Friday, 21 people were arrested outside the immigration detention center in Broadview following a morning demonstration outside the facility.","President Donald Trump and his administration have claimed repeatedly that the immigration raids that have terrorized communities nationwide this year are focused on getting the ""worst of the worst"" off the streets and out of the country, but new detention data filed by the Department of Justice on Friday shows that only a tiny fraction of the more than 600 people who remain in detention in the Chicago area from raids over recent months have any criminal record, bolstering anecdotal evidence that many of those targeted for by ICE and federal border agents are hard-working, law-abiding members of society.

According to the Chicago Tribune:

The Trump administration on Friday released the names of 614 people whose Chicago-area immigration arrests may have violated a 2022 consent decree, and only 16 of them have criminal histories that present a “high public safety risk.”

The list was produced as part of an ongoing lawsuit alleging immigration agents have repeatedly violated the terms of the in-court settlement, mostly during “Operation Midway Blitz,” that puts a high bar on making so-called warrantless arrests without a prior warrant or probable cause.

The newspaper reports that of the 16 people arrested with criminal histories—representing just 2.6% of the total listed in the filing— ""five involved domestic battery, two were related to drunken driving, and one allegedly had an unidentified criminal history in another country."" None had criminal backgrounds that included worst-of-the-worst offenses like rape or murder.

Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the government to provide more information about the more than 600 people being held in detention and suggested he would order their release if compelling public-safety reasons were not presented. While ordering the immediate release of 13 people he deemed were arrested unlawfully, Cummings gave the government until Friday to release the additional information on those being held.

The Chicago Sun-Times reports that the list of 614 detainees comes from a longer list of roughly 1,800 individuals arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Chicago area between June 11 and October 7, of which ""only about 750 of them remain in the country."" Most of the others were deported, and their criminal histories were not presented in Friday's disclosure.

The consent decree at issue, known as the Castañon-Nava settlement agreement, restricts the ability of ICE agents or others working with them to make warrantless arrests in Illinois.

“Communities throughout the Chicago area have been traumatized by ICE and other federal agents’ chaotic and violent actions in our neighborhoods in recent months, and potentially hundreds of families already have been permanently separated as a result of unlawful arrests and rapid deportations without due process,"" said Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation for the National Immigration Justice Center (NIJC), who is backing the legal case against the unlawful arrests and detentions in Chicago, after the order issued by Cummings on Wednesday.

""NIJC and our partners will continue to demand justice for our communities and accountability for the lawless administration we all are facing.”

During Wednesday's hearing, the judge suggested many of those who remain in detention likely have no history of criminal conduct and were targeted by federal agents simply for fitting a specific profile. As the Sun-Times reports:

Cummings said that 54 of those people were arrested at work, including 20 landscapers and four ride-share or taxi drivers. Twenty were arrested commuting to or from work, he added, and nine were arrested at a Home Depot or Menards, “presumably either seeking work or to pick up supplies.”

Seven were also arrested at an “immigration-related hearing,” Cummings said, while 11 were arrested in public places like a park, gas station or even a Dunkin’ Donuts drive-thru.

“It seems highly likely to me that at least some of those individuals are among the 615 detainees who are not subject to mandatory detention,” Cummings said. He also found them unlikely to be members of gangs, “assorted other ne’er-do-wells” or the “worst of the worst.”

Community members living in Chicago and its outlying suburbs, including Broadview, have expressed anger at Trump's ICE operations in the region, which have seen school teachers, childcare providers, day laborers, and other neighbors targeted and arrested.

""Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,"" Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.""

Local officials, including Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, a Democrat, criticized such actions, saying in a statement they ""are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.""

""We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,"" said the statement, also signed by County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Enforcement begins after rumors

The federal government hadn't previously announced the push. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said earlier this week that two federal officials had told him that Customs agents would be arriving soon.

Charlotte has seen a spate of high-profile crimes this year, including the shocking murder of Ukranian refugee Iryna Zarutska, 23, who was stabbed to death on a Charlotte light rail train in August by a repeat offender with an extensive history of violence.

Paola Garcia, a spokesperson with Camino - a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte - said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pulling people over since Friday.

""Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,"" Garcia said. ""I even saw a few people being pulled over on the way to work yesterday, and then just from community members seeing an increase in ICE and Border Patrol agents in the city of Charlotte.""

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work when he saw Border Patrol agents chasing people.

""I saw a lot of Latinos running. I wondered why they were running. The thing is, there were a lot of Border Patrol agents chasing them,"" he said.

Aceituno, a 46-year-old Charlotte resident, said he himself was stopped - twice - by Border Patrol agents. On the second encounter, they forced him out of his vehicle after breaking the car window and threw him to the ground.

""I told them, 'I'm an American citizen,"" he told The Associated Press. ""They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.""

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said he was finally allowed to go free after showing documents that proved his citizenship. Aceituno said he had to walk back some distance to his car. He later filed a police report over the broken glass.

An encounter in a front yard

In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton's front yard on Saturday morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One agent tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They didn't respond, and the agents left in a gray minivan without making arrests.

""This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we've got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They've broken no laws, and that's what concerns me,"" Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone, told The Associated Press.

""It's an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,"" the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports that Charlotte could be the next city facing an immigration crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed, but the contractor decided to go ahead.

""Half an hour later he's in our yard, he's working and Border Patrol rolls up,"" she said. ""They're here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there's just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.""

Some businesses close

Local organizations sought to prepare for the push, trying to inform immigrants of their rights and considering peaceful protests. JD Mazuera Arias, who won election to the Charlotte City Council in September, was one of about a dozen people standing watch Saturday outside a Latin American bakery in his district in east Charlotte.

A nearby bakery was closed amid word of the possible immigration crackdown, he said. The government action was hurting both people's livelihoods and the city's economy, he said.

""This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?"" he asked. ""This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants, but for U.S. citizens.""

President Donald Trump's administration has defended federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws.

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat with a Republican-majority legislature, said Friday that the vast majority of those detained in these operations have no criminal convictions, and some are American citizens.

He urged people to record any ""inappropriate behavior"" they see and notify local law enforcement about it.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department had emphasized ahead of time that it isn't involved in federal immigration enforcement.

According to friends and family, Jeremy Dottin-Reina, a French citizen living in the U.S. with an expired visa, was followed by unmarked SUVs from the home he shares with his husband, Rick Reina, in Liverpool to their shop, Syracuse Soapworks, on Hawley Avenue.

They say multiple vehicles trailed them through the drive into the city. When they pulled in behind the building, Jeremy got out of the car and headed for the back door of the shop.

He made it inside and locked the door just seconds before agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reached the entrance.

“Rick had called me early in the morning that they were being tailed by ICE and Jeremy just had made it into the house and they were right on his tail and he was feet away from being taken,” said Michael DeSalvo, owner of Hairanoia

DeSalvo is more than just a friend. He owns Hairanoia, the hair salon directly across the street from Syracuse Soapworks, and has a long history of community activism — from supporting immigrants to providing end-of-life care for people with AIDS.

He says as soon as he got the call, he threw on clothes and started reaching out to every activist and rapid-response group he knew.

DeSalvo’s first move was to warn the neighborhood. Right as the attempted raid was unfolding, he posted an urgent message on Facebook:

“PEOPLE PLEASE GET HERE TO HAIRANOIA IMMEDIATELY. ICE IS TRYING TO TAKE SOMEONE ACROSS FROM HAIRANOIA.”

Within minutes, he says, dozens of community members showed up outside the shop to stand watch and support the couple.

“The conditions and the way that people are being treated is absolutely disgusting and inhumane and I hope that someday there will be accountability for the treatment,” DeSalvo said.

DeSalvo says a small group of friends, advocates and legal contacts spent the entire day quietly strategizing — careful not to reveal details that could tip off ICE. They won’t share their full plan publicly, but say they were able to help Jeremy leave the city and, eventually, leave the United States without being taken into immigration custody.

Jeremy is now back in his home country of France.

While Jeremy is home overseas, Rick and their community are still processing what happened, and what it means for their future in Syracuse.

“When we last saw each other, the emotions and the seriousness of the day we have not had a chance to even really process it,” DeSalvo said, describing seeing Rick again days later.

“Rick has not had a chance to process any of it. He’s left holding the bag of their life together alone. Emotionally, think about how sad that is.”

DeSalvo says it feels, in some ways, like a death, even though Jeremy is alive and safe.

The couple has spent more than two decades building a life and a business in Syracuse. Syracuse Soapworks has become a familiar name in the city, and DeSalvo says the loss of Jeremy isn’t just personal — it’s a blow to the neighborhood.

For now, Syracuse Soapworks remains open, but Rick told supporters the shop will eventually have to close without Jeremy there to help run it. Friends say they expect to organize fundraising efforts, including a GoFundMe, to help Rick transition and eventually reunite with his husband in France.

DeSalvo says one lesson stands out from the chaos of that day: neighbors looking out for neighbors.

He hopes what happened on Hawley Avenue will push more people to get to know the families and business owners around them, especially those who may feel vulnerable.

“Know your neighbors,” he said. “And look out for them.”",https://cnycentral.com/resources/media/e894e73f-79f2-4216-a0eb-b8f895ea9e70-Screenshot20251114183741.png,N,,2025-11-15 16:56:52.551473

“I have a friend group – most of them are on skilled worker visas,” she said.","As Reform UK soars in the polls, Britain’s migrant communities are facing an uncertain future.

The party has announced a swathe of hardline immigration policies, including its plans to abolish indefinite leave to remain – the right to settle permanently in the UK after five years of residence.

Nigel Farage has said non-UK citizens would have to continue to apply for visas, with new higher salary thresholds. Although Reform has not specified what those thresholds would be, it is reported they could be set at about £60,000 a year – far in excess of the £41,700 currently required for most skilled worker visas.

Skilled worker visas come with restrictions and can be cancelled if a person leaves their employer, or if their salary changes.

In addition, the Labour government’s plans to extend the indefinite leave to remain qualifying period to 10 years have been perceived as an attempt to claw back the support of voters who are considering backing Reform.

Here, some people who have chosen to make the UK their home tell the Guardian how the lives they have built are now in jeopardy.

Jinnie Shin, 44, an emergency medicine doctor living in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire

Shin, originally from the US, came to the UK as a medical student in 2015. She had barely left medical school when the NHS was paralysed by Covid. As a newly qualified doctor at Croydon university hospital, south London, she found herself battling to save the lives of those floored by the virus – and comforting the dying as they said goodbye to their loved ones on video calls.

Five years on, Shin, from Boston, is now an emergency medicine registrar at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Harlow, Essex. Despite the sacrifices she has made for the NHS – she didn’t see her family for 18 months while working 12-hour shifts treating patients on ventilators – she wonders if she has a future in Britain.

Shin, 44, is now eligible for indefinite leave to remain. However, she has been left questioning whether it is worth paying the “enormous” costs – application fees start at about £3,000 – only for Reform to rescind settled status if they win the next general election.

She also worries that setting the salary thresholds for skilled worked visas at about £60,000 a year would devastate the NHS. A registrar beginning specialist training earns £52,656. The starting salary for a resident doctor – formerly known as a junior doctor – is £38,831.

“You are basically talking about culling [doctors] who will eventually become our registrars and consultants,” Shin said. “This sort of move would eliminate the foot soldiers of the NHS.”

Shin maintains that she was “fortunate” to be able to help the health service navigate the worst crisis in its history in her first year as a doctor, but feels the toll it took on her and other immigrants – about a fifth of the NHS workforce is from outside the UK – may be forgotten.

“It was terrifying,” she said. “I saw more death in the first two weeks than I have in my entire career thus far. As traumatised as many healthcare workers are, we do appreciate that we did a great service for people.

“Every day was the worst day of someone else’s life and that was our day, day in, day out. It was truly devastating. I was on my own without any family support.

“Some of us actually sacrificed our lives. Some of us have come out of it like we’ve been to war – because we really were at war with this virus. People are talking about us as if we’re a drain on resources.

“I have good friends who I see regularly. I have a partner, who is European, but has been settled in the UK for 20 years. We have a fantastic life here, in terms of what we have built for ourselves, but when we talk about our future here, we’re just not sure.”

Shin said she has also observed an uptick in “microaggressions” directed at some doctors of colour. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, recently said he was shocked at the “ugly” racism experienced by some NHS workers.

She added: “As someone who, every day, goes in and takes care of the people of the UK – some of these people, what if inside they’re thinking: I’d rather have a white, English, male doctor? It’s an uncomfortable situation to be in.

“I hate to think staying in the UK would be a bad decision, but it’s looking less and less like a good one. I would love to stay, because I’ve built my life here, but I don’t really feel that welcome any more.”

Shyamsundar was elated when he was offered his “dream job” as a human factors engineer, working to help enhance Britain’s defence capabilities amid increasing global instability. In 2021, he came to the UK from Pune, western India, on a skilled worker visa.

He and his wife, a graphic designer, adore the life they have built in Bury, Greater Manchester, and want to buy their own home there. But with the future of Britain’s immigration system shrouded in uncertainty, they have put their plans on hold.

“2025 has been the hardest year I’ve had to face,” he said. “The reminders that your life may be temporary are a constant drain on your mental health. The big news announcements from all the parties take their toll. It’s always there in your mind that your way of life can be taken away from you. I haven’t slept very well in the last six months. It’s been difficult. It’s been an exercise in resilience. We’re socially, financially and even emotionally invested in the UK. We’ve almost had the rug pulled from under us.”

Shyamsundar should be eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain next April, but is plagued by questions about whether this will guarantee a long-term future in the UK. He also lives with the threat of having his visa revoked should the rules change. He said he would not qualify for a skilled worker visa if Reform raised the salary threshold to about £60,000 a year.

“It doesn’t take away from what my job is – the people I want to keep safe, the pilots, ground crew, everybody,” he said. “But there is a lot of rhetoric around immigration. It can be demoralising when you focus on it, but as collective, we as defence workers, immigrants in defence and aerospace, make a difference.

“One of the biggest messages I try to deliver is that migrants are a net contributors. We have had a lot of chat that immigration is a drain on the economy. When you look at the hard data, there is a very different story.”

Shyamsundar said questions over his future in the UK often hit him at unexpected moments.

“It’s like a death by a thousand cuts – walking along in the autumn, seeing the leaves fall, and thinking, I might not be here next autumn,” he said. “That’s what really breaks your heart. It takes a toll on people.”

Douna Haj Ahmed, 34, a Syrian refugeeworking for a multiple sclerosis charity and living in Wembley, London

Haj Ahmed arrived in the UK on a scholarship in 2017, after living through years of war in Syria. Eight years later, Haj Ahmed – who works for a leading multiple sclerosis charity and says she has never claimed benefits – can’t imagine living anywhere but London.

“My integration is rooted in real human connection,” she said. “London now feels like home in every sense of the word. Each time I travel outside of the city, I feel the pull to return. When I return to London I’m pleased – I’m home.”

Haj Ahmed devotes her spare time to charity work. She has worked as a volunteer interpreter for refugees, given free tuition to A-level and GCSE students and provided companionship for dementia patients.

She and her husband, Abdullah al-Nofal, 37, have bought a house in Wembley, north-west London, and are in the process of applying for indefinite leave to remain, although they say their application has been complicated by recent regime change in Syria. Nofal says he was detained in Syria’s notorious al-Khatib prison – known as “hell on earth” because thousands were tortured there.

“Throughout these years, my husband and I have contributed to the economy and society without ever relying on the state,” Haj Ahmed, 34, said. “We have integrated fully into British society and British life. The relationships I have formed have become the foundation of my sense of belonging. I have embraced UK traditions, history and social norms.”

Haj Ahmed, who added that she has severe depression because of uncertainty over her immigration status, said Reform’s plans to scrap indefinite leave to remain would “destroy” her life.

“This policy undermines a sense of stability for us, which is essential to integration.” she said. “When people work, study and contribute for years, they deserve a clear and reliable pathway to permanence, not shifting rules which make belonging feel really conditional.

“I wanted to have children this year. We worked very hard to have a home here, so now we have a mortgage. We are reaching for stability but we don’t know where we’re going. The broader question is, what kind of country does the UK want to be? My story shows what refugees and immigrants can contribute when given the opportunity.”

Haj Ahmed said being deported to Syria would be unthinkable. Although the Assad regime fell late last year, concerns about violence and human rights violations persist. The country has also been targeted by Israeli drone strikes.

“I don’t have any other place to go,” she said. “I’m being treated as a number, a figure. It’s not my fault, what happened in my country. I ran away from death and the Assad regime.

“Many Syrians who visited Syria recently say they feel like strangers in a place they were born because the country has changed and so have we. Belonging is not just about geography, it’s about where your life is, where your friends are, where you feel safe, where you have a home.”

Sayali Wandhekar, 30, a designer living in Camden, London

Sayali Wandhekar moved to London to study for a master’s degree in 2020. She loved it so much that, in 2022, she took a job as a designer in the corporate sector. However, the “shifting goalposts” on immigration rules mean she is now struggling to plan for the future.

Wandhekar, 30, hopes to apply for indefinite leave to remain when her skilled worker visa expires in 2027, unless the eligibility criteria changes before then.

“I don’t know what the system is going to look like,” she said. “How many years am I going to have to be on a skilled worker visa? I’ve come so close to getting ILR (indefinite leave to remain). In terms of mental health, it does create a lot of uncertainty.

“I want to be here long term. I’ve made a life here. I have a strong friend group. I have a proper life. But am I going to buy a house, settle here, have children here? It’s something I can’t plan for.”

Wandhekar says a “significant” number of her colleagues are “distressed” by the idea the salary threshold for a skilled worker visa could increase to about £60,000 a year. She added that a Reform victory in the next general election could force her to rethink her future in the country – and perhaps prompt her to return to her native Pune, in western India.

“[It] would definitely turn me towards considering other places I can move to, plus potentially moving back to India,” she said. “The last thing I want is to be on a skilled worker visa forever. It restricts my freedom.”

Wandhekar added that she feared the UK could suffer a brain drain if skilled workers were unable to settle in the country permanently.

“I have a friend group – most of them are on skilled worker visas,” she said. “If they were to scrap indefinite leave to remain, most, if not all of them will look for options outside of the country.

“I have friends who are engineers, in finance and consulting – highly skilled jobs. If they were to move back to other countries, then we are going to see fewer people in those workplaces. From a diversity perspective, you are going to miss out on international talent. How do you upscale people in the UK to take on those jobs?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d0987e72b5dd4c045230b37f367146cb5417b1e/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf64a430075ff9866f17163d97b9fd99",N,,2025-11-15 13:56:51.169773

The move seems to be in part due to a “political grudge match” between Jeffries and Lawler, Politico noted.
However, the collective bargaining rights of over 1 million federal workers — whose lives were just thrown into limbo amid the longest-ever government shutdown — are at stake.
Trump’s sweeping executive orders have stripped the right of collective bargaining for workers across over a dozen federal agencies.","On Wednesday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) blocked an effort broadly supported by his own caucus to force a vote on restoring crucial labor protections for federal workers that were revoked by President Donald Trump earlier this year.

A Democrat-led petition on the “Protect America’s Workforce Act” is just two signatures short of the 218-member threshold it needs to bypass GOP leadership and force a vote on the legislation. The bill would reverse a Trump executive order that removed collective bargaining rights from hundreds of thousands of federal employees — a major blow to labor rights in the heavily unionized sector.

Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Arizona), coming off of her confirmation long delayed by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana), tried to sign the petition on Wednesday. The petition for the legislation has been signed by the entire Democratic caucus other than Grijalva, as well as three Republicans. If Grijalva signed it, then Rep. Mike Lawler (R-New York) was poised to be the 218th signature, Politico reports.

But members of Jeffries’s staff stopped Grijalva as she went to add her signature on the House floor on Wednesday, Politico reported. A Jeffries spokesperson, Christie Stephenson, criticized Lawler when contacted about the move.

“If Congressman Lawler was as concerned about these working people as he apparently is about his own reelection, he would have signed the discharge petition last night, or any time in the over 160 days since it launched,” Stephenson told the outlet. She said that Democrats would force a vote on it soon.

“We also look forward to him signing on as a co-sponsor of the historically bipartisan Protecting the Right to Organize Act given his sincere concern for collective bargaining rights in this country,” Stephenson said.

The move seems to be in part due to a “political grudge match” between Jeffries and Lawler, Politico noted. Last month, the two got into a shouting match in relation to the government shutdown, with Lawler at one point questioning why Jeffries hadn’t yet endorsed Democratic nominee for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani.

Democrats have also raised concerns that Lawler has said that he’s waiting to be the 218th lawmaker to sign on so he could tout it in his reelection campaign.

However, the collective bargaining rights of over 1 million federal workers — whose lives were just thrown into limbo amid the longest-ever government shutdown — are at stake.

""Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to.
""And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop — this time for the rest of this lawsuit.""
She also ordered the government to ""provide private rooms for closed-door discussions between detainees and current and prospective attorneys, legal representatives, and legal assistants.""
At a hearing last month, government attorney Jonathan Ross argued that “evidence shows detainees at B-18 are meeting with attorneys, they have access to counsel.""","A federal judge on Friday ruled that the government is ""partially blocking access to lawyers"" for immigrant detainees held in a downtown Los Angeles processing center and ordered it to stop.

The preliminary injunction essentially extends a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued in July, requiring federal immigration agencies to allow legal visitation at the B-18 detention facility in downtown L.A. seven days a week.

In her ruling this week, Frimpong said that lawyer visiting hours at B-18, which is in the basement of a federal building, have been closed down repeatedly without letting lawyers know, despite her ordering the government to notify them.

""Officers insist on keeping the door open when lawyers are trying to have private conversations with their clients — even though this means the conversations are no longer private,"" Frimpong said. ""Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to. Individuals in B-18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have. And sometimes, individuals are moved from B-18 to another location which does not allow lawyer visits at all.""

""And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop — this time for the rest of this lawsuit.""

Mark Rosenbaum, of Public Counsel, which helped bring the lawsuit, said that the court has ""affirmed that the Constitution does not stop at the doors of a detention center.""

""This is a terribly important ruling, not just because it enjoins the denial of access to lawyers, but because it takes apart a key part of ICE's strategy in Los Angeles and that has been to dehumanize Latinos and to do everything they can to assure that Latinos that are subject to these raids are not able to avail themselves of their basic rights, not be able to disclose to lawyers the racial profiling that is going forward and not be able to establish their dignity and their basic rights to due process,"" Rosenbaum said.

Frimpong ordered that legal visitation be permitted seven days per week, for a minimum of eight hours per day on business days and a minimum of four hours per day on weekends and holidays. She also ordered the government to ""provide private rooms for closed-door discussions between detainees and current and prospective attorneys, legal representatives, and legal assistants.""

Detainees will be provided with access to confidential telephone calls with legal team members and those calls ""shall not be screened, recorded, or otherwise monitored,"" Frimpong wrote.

""No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ""All detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members. Every single detainee receives due process.""

At a hearing last month, government attorney Jonathan Ross argued that “evidence shows detainees at B-18 are meeting with attorneys, they have access to counsel."" He also said that exigent circumstances — protests that sprang up against immigration raids — shifted conditions at the facility, thus impacting clients’ access to attorneys.

“That circumstance has now changed and conditions at B-18 have now normalized,” he said, adding that “the government is going to do the right thing” regardless of any order.

“The court should not be ordering the government to do what it already is,” Ross said, adding that detainees “are receiving what the 5th Amendment requires.""

The government had requested a stay of the injunction pending appeal, which Frimpong denied.

The American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

Along with access issues, plaintiffs also argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn’t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful warrantless arrests.

Frimpong previously issued a ruling in the same case temporarily blocking federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. The Supreme Court granted an emergency appeal and lifted that order.

Last month, Frimpong approved expedited discovery on the claim that the aggressive raids violate a person’s 4th Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. The government will have to produce documents and witnesses for deposition relating to around 15 raids, in addition to general operational information.

""I think there is some sense out there that with the Supreme Court's granting of the stay that this put this case to bed,"" Rosenbaum said. ""This case is alive and kicking and the racial profiling and other illegal attacks on the Latino community and the community at large, we're going to put them to an end.""

Jose Barco-Chirino, 39, came to the U.S. when he was four years old, later joining the military where he served two tours in Iraq and was injured in combat, and applied for citizenship while deployed in 2006. His representatives say that, unfortunately, Barco-Chirino’s paperwork was lost.

Advocate Anna Stout told FOX31 that his family had fled Cuba and gone to Venezuela after his father was exiled, then came to the U.S. as political refugees. Stout said that Barco has no ties in Venezuela or Cuba, and asserted this puts him at an elevated risk if he were to be removed to either country.

On Friday, Stout said that Barco-Chirino’s family received a call from a detainee at the Aurora GEO facility, which is contracted by ICE, saying that Barco-Chirino had been removed from the detention facility. On Wednesday, Nov. 12, the family was told Barco-Chirino was at a staging area in Arizona, and on Friday, at about 8:15 a.m. ET, the family reportedly received a text saying their family member had been removed from the U.S.

ICE said that Barco-Chirino was deported to Nogales, Mexico, after receiving a final order of removal on Feb. 12, 2025.

“Jose Barco-Chirino was arrested by ERO Denver officers Jan. 21, 2025, at the Colorado State Penitentiary in Canon City, Colorado,” an ICE spokesperson told FOX31 on Friday. “Barco was released after serving time for a conviction of attempted murder, extreme indifference, and felony menacing with a real or simulated weapon. He was served with a notice to appear and will remain in ICE custody pending the resolution of his immigration proceedings.”

Stout and Barco-Chirino’s attorney told FOX31 in August that Barco-Chirino served 15 years in prison for attempted murder after he left the military, where he had been stationed out of Colorado Springs. He was arrested by ICE immediately after he was paroled.

Attorneys had argued for Barco-Chirino to be sent to Mexico, over Venezuela or Cuba, where he could still receive treatment for his PTSD and past suicidal ideations. The family said they feared he would be tortured if he was sent to Venezuela or Cuba due to his military service.

California requires driver's licenses and work permits to have the same expiration dates, officials said. Notices were sent out on Nov. 6 to affected drivers warning their licenses would expire in 60 days.

The move comes amid an ongoing clash between the Trump administration and Gov. Gavin Newsom over California's non-domiciled commercial driver's licensing program. It also follows a nationwide audit of such programs after officials said a truck driver living in the U.S. illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.

“This is just the tip of the iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a written statement.

State officials, however, said the drivers were not ""illegal immigrants"" and that they were authorized to work in the country by the federal government.

“Once again, Sean ‘Road Rules’ Duffy fails to share the truth — spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,” said Brandon Richards, a Newsom spokesman.

California is one of 19 states, in addition to Washington, D.C., that issues driving licenses to immigrants without legal status. Doing so allows people to work and travel safely, immigrant rights advocates argue.

But California — along with six other states, including Texas — came under scrutiny after an audit conducted by the Department of Transportation's Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency responsible for preventing commercial motor vehicle-related deaths and injuries.

Read more: Transportation Dept. tightens noncitizen truck driver rules after fatal crash in Florida

That audit found irregularities in the issuance of non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses.

Duffy said the audit found 25% of the licenses issued in California violated federal rules, including by extending well beyond an individual's work permit end date.

In October, following the audit, Duffy withheld more than $40 million in transportation grants and claimed California was not only continuing to issue commercial driver's licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally, but was also not enforcing new English language requirements for truckers.

Officials have refuted Duffy's claims and said the state has complied with federal laws and regulations. California's Department of Motor Vehicles said on its website that it was not issuing or renewing non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses as of Sept. 29.

Proposed new federal rules that would include mandatory federal immigration status checks, limiting the duration of the license and limiting eligibility to certain immigration visas, were temporarily put on hold by a federal appeals court this week.

The ruling provided relief for thousands of immigrants who were at risk of losing their licenses.

Those arrested—including Woolf, Rev.
Luke Harris-Ferree, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church of Evanston; and Eric Haar, a member of Grace, were taken to nearby jails.","At least three Evanston residents were among 21 people arrested Friday at the Immigration & Customs (ICE) Enforcement facility in west suburban Broadview. They were part of a clergy-led protest against ICE. Many of the leaders had worked for weeks to prepare for their civil disobedience action. Some felt that previous Broadview clergy-run events that were based solely on prayer and ritual were not bold enough to make people take notice of the conditions there. They wanted to take to the street — and were surprised by the quick violence that they met.

Rev. Michael Woolf, senior pastor of Lake Street Church, was one of dozens of demonstrators who walked onto Beach Street about one block north of the ICE facility. The short street is hemmed by barricades. Demonstrators are supposed to stay off the street in what is called a “free speech zone.”

When Woolf and the others got to the street, they were confronted by Illinois State Police troopers, Cook County Sheriff’s police and Broadview police. The first wave of police responders wore regular uniforms. Police in later waves were in tactical gear: helmets, face shields, and were armed with batons and other weapons.

The Cook County Sheriff’s office released a statement that said: “Four officers sustained injuries trying to redirect them back to the jersey barriers.” About 50 protesters walked onto Beach Street, police said. Those arrested—including Woolf, Rev. Luke Harris-Ferree, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church of Evanston; and Eric Haar, a member of Grace, were taken to nearby jails. They face charges of obstruction, disorderly conduct and walking onto a highway, according to the sheriff’s office.

Prior to the demonstration, two Evanston clergy members—Rev. Eileen Wiviott, senior minister of the Unitarian Church of Evanston, and Rabbi Brant Rosen—took part in a prayer vigil in the freedom-of-speech area.

“Our siblings are locked inside these walls just a few feet away, without basic necessities, without universal human rights, without hope,” said Wiviott. “[U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory] Bovino and his CBP agents may have left this area, but our siblings are not free. They are not liberated. They are not able to leave that building, and the abuses against them continue wherever we build walls and dividing lines, wherever we cage human beings.”

Rosen was more specific. “Our neighbors, locked inside these walls, have been denied toilet paper, a basic need that we all need and take for granted. According to the Torah, we learn that every human being is created with ‘B’tselem Elohim,’ in the divine image. That means each and every one of us is of infinite worth and deserving of human dignity. When those in power denies basic human needs to others, we diminish God’s presence in the world. . . . God stands with the oppressed. God demands freedom.”

Eric Haar said the protest was worthwhile because it gathered attention. “We can’t turn a blind eye on this anymore,” he said after his release Friday afternoon in suburban Maywood. “The more of us that show up the more pressure we are going to put on the government to stop these terroristic abductions of our neighbors.”

Haar returned to the Broadview scene after his release to look for his glasses that went missing. It was the first time he joined a civil disobedience protest.

“This is our duty as Americans to stand up and criticize and fight back against injustice when our government is being unjust to us as citizens,” he said.

Back home Friday evening, Luke Harris-Ferree said: “I’m doing okay. My body is sore. I’m tired, but I’m just processing what happened.”

Harris-Ferree, who also had never before been arrested at a protest, said he was immediately surrounded by police on the street. “I was standing there with my hands up telling the officers we just want to pray with the people inside. We’re here nonviolently,” he said.”There was a cop with his wooden baton pushing it into my ribs, telling me to get back. There was really nowhere to go.”

The scene got violent quickly, he said, because officers did not expect the number of people at the protest or the street action. “I could see it in their eyes. They were scared.”

Harris-Ferree suffered a slight injury when pushed to the ground. “What they did to me was very small in comparison to what they are doing to other people in our country right now,” he said.

The detained people must be granted bond by the end of next week, the judge ruled, but big questions remain about how the process will play out – including locating those arrested, some of whom have been moved across the country, plaintiffs say.

Here’s what we know – and what we don’t know – about what happens next.

What did the judge decide?

US District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who was nominated by former US President Joe Biden in 2023, sided with attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center and the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit alleging federal agents violated a 2022 settlement agreement over warrantless arrests in the Chicago area.

Last month, Cummings ruled agents violated the previously agreed upon consent decree.

Under the decree, if ICE seeks to make a warrantless arrest, it must meet conditions like establishing probable cause that someone is in the country illegally, assessing their community ties and whether they could be a flight risk.

The plaintiffs alleged more than 3,000 people were arrested between June and October in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the federal government’s immigration crackdown in Chicago and surrounding areas.

The settlement remains in effect until February 2, 2026, and says if someone is arrested in a way “that violates the settlement in the Chicago Area of Responsibility — which includes in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri — they may be able to seek individual remedies —including immediate release from detention.”

Who will be released and when?

Of the 3,000 people arrested between June and October, 615 – one-fifth – are not subject to mandatory detention and don’t have final orders of removal, the ruling says. Those who remain detained out of that group, as long as they don’t pose a high public safety risk, must be granted bond by noon on November 21, according to the ruling.

Out of a list of the more than 600 detainees the Justice Department shared with the court, only 16 had explanations for why they were given an “ICE Further Designation of High Public Safety Risk.” The document indicates they were arrested for a range of charges, including for aggravated assault, DUI, domestic battery, and criminal conspiracy to traffic narcotics.

The document also lists around 40 people as having a “high” risk to public safety designation – though officials do not provide the reasons why. CNN has reached out to Department of Homeland Security and DOJ attorneys for clarity.

Two challenges will remain: locating people and figuring out who and how their bond will get paid.

“What’s challenging is at this point, they’ve moved these people all over the country,” Fleming told CNN on Thursday. “Let’s say we were able to post bond for a lot of these people and we were working on it with families, with other organizations … I’m not certain that the government is going to bring them back to Chicago and so they will drop them in the middle of nowhere where they’ve detained them.”

The organization believes at least 1,100 of the 3,000 arrested individuals have voluntarily left the country, saying they “gave up” fighting their cases, Fleming said during a news conference Wednesday.

“They are people who disproportionately had no interaction with the immigration or criminal justice system,” Fleming told CNN. “Who’ve lived in the community for years, have families, have businesses, you name it, who were stopped in the community, whether driving to work, picking up kids at school.”

The list of detainees CNN reviewed showed that 75 people have already been “removed” and multiple others are listed as having been “paroled” or “bonded out.”

What happens to immigration operations in Chicago?

Government attorneys have requested a stay of Cummings’ order until next Friday, according to Fleming; the legal pause could prevent the government from deporting or detaining someone until the court decides next steps.

But immigration officials seem undeterred in their mission.

“If (Pritzker is) pleased that he thinks operations are being ratcheted down, well, just the opposite is going to occur,” Gregory Bovino, the top Border Patrol official leading Operation Midway Blitz, told Fox News on Thursday.

“We’re ratcheting operations up in Chicago,” he said.

In response to the ruling, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the decision is putting the lives of Americans at risk.

“At every turn, activist judges, sanctuary politicians, and violent rioters have actively tried to prevent our law enforcement officers from arresting and removing the worst of the worst,” McLaughlin said in a statement to CNN Wednesday. “Now an ACTIVIST JUDGE is putting the lives of Americans directly at risk by ordering 615 illegal aliens be released into the community.”

The Trump administration filed a notice Thursday saying it will appeal the ruling and asked Cummings to put his order on hold while the appeal is heard. Cummings did not immediately rule on the request, instead asking the plaintiffs to respond by midday Monday.

Meanwhile, Bovino left Chicago Thursday morning with his CBP agents and will head next to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to a source familiar with the planning.

DHS declined to comment on his exact whereabouts, with McLaughlin saying Bovino “has multiple bounties on his head from Latin Kings and other cartels.” Bovino told Fox News later that day he was in West Virginia.

Bovino and other federal agents have faced scrutiny, including from a federal judge, for alleged heavy-handed tactics and violent use of force against people getting arrested and protesters.

“All of this, all of the tactics of Bovino, all of the tactics of (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) have been unlawful in the vast, vast majority of arrests,” Fleming said Wednesday.

ICE will continue to carry out immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, McLaughlin previously told CNN, while other immigration legal challenges move through the courts.

State advocates have alleged “inhumane” conditions at a federal immigration facility in a Chicago suburb, where protesters have been demonstrating for weeks, with some leading to arrests. Those protesters and news outlets are at the center of another legal battle as they claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.

The state of Illinois and Chicago have also sued the Trump administration over its move to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago amid protests against the federal government’s immigration enforcement campaign.

“Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to.
Individuals in B-18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have.
“All detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members.
Frimpong previously issued a ruling in the same case temporarily blocking federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests.","A federal judge on Friday ruled that the government is “partially blocking access to lawyers” for immigrant detainees held in a downtown Los Angeles processing center and ordered it to stop.

The preliminary injunction essentially extends a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued in July, requiring federal immigration agencies to allow legal visitation at the B-18 detention facility in downtown L.A. seven days a week.

In her ruling this week, Frimpong said that lawyer visiting hours at B-18, which is in the basement of a federal building, have been closed down repeatedly without letting lawyers know, despite her ordering the government to notify them.

“Officers insist on keeping the door open when lawyers are trying to have private conversations with their clients — even though this means the conversations are no longer private,” Frimpong said. “Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers — even though they are not supposed to. Individuals in B-18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have. And sometimes, individuals are moved from B-18 to another location which does not allow lawyer visits at all.”

“And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop — this time for the rest of this lawsuit.”

Mark Rosenbaum, of Public Counsel, which helped bring the lawsuit, said that the court has “affirmed that the Constitution does not stop at the doors of a detention center.”

“This is a terribly important ruling, not just because it enjoins the denial of access to lawyers, but because it takes apart a key part of ICE’s strategy in Los Angeles and that has been to dehumanize Latinos and to do everything they can to assure that Latinos that are subject to these raids are not able to avail themselves of their basic rights, not be able to disclose to lawyers the racial profiling that is going forward and not be able to establish their dignity and their basic rights to due process,” Rosenbaum said.

Frimpong ordered that legal visitation be permitted seven days per week, for a minimum of eight hours per day on business days and a minimum of four hours per day on weekends and holidays. She also ordered the government to “provide private rooms for closed-door discussions between detainees and current and prospective attorneys, legal representatives, and legal assistants.”

Detainees will be provided with access to confidential telephone calls with legal team members and those calls “shall not be screened, recorded, or otherwise monitored,” Frimpong wrote.

“No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States,” Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “All detainees are provided ample opportunity to communicate with their attorneys and family members. Every single detainee receives due process.”

At a hearing last month, government attorney Jonathan Ross argued that “evidence shows detainees at B-18 are meeting with attorneys, they have access to counsel.” He also said that exigent circumstances — protests that sprang up against immigration raids — shifted conditions at the facility, thus impacting clients’ access to attorneys.

“That circumstance has now changed and conditions at B-18 have now normalized,” he said, adding that “the government is going to do the right thing” regardless of any order.

“The court should not be ordering the government to do what it already is,” Ross said, adding that detainees “are receiving what the 5th Amendment requires.”

The government had requested a stay of the injunction pending appeal, which Frimpong denied.

The American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys filed the lawsuit on behalf of several immigrant rights groups, three immigrants picked up at a bus stop and two U.S. citizens, one of whom was held despite showing agents his identification.

Along with access issues, plaintiffs also argued in their complaint that immigration agents cornered brown-skinned people in Home Depot parking lots, at carwashes and at bus stops across Southern California in a show of force without establishing reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration laws. They allege agents didn’t identify themselves, as required under federal law, and made unlawful warrantless arrests.

Frimpong previously issued a ruling in the same case temporarily blocking federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate immigration arrests. The Supreme Court granted an emergency appeal and lifted that order.

Last month, Frimpong approved expedited discovery on the claim that the aggressive raids violate a person’s 4th Amendment right against unreasonable search and seizure. The government will have to produce documents and witnesses for deposition relating to around 15 raids, in addition to general operational information.

“I think there is some sense out there that with the Supreme Court’s granting of the stay that this put this case to bed,” Rosenbaum said. “This case is alive and kicking and the racial profiling and other illegal attacks on the Latino community and the community at large, we’re going to put them to an end.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54a1018/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe9%2F38%2F44f591dd42e6be9e0fc74cbf7179%2F1518685-me-worker-arrested-outside-newsom-event-ces-00102.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 12:57:48.689158

In December 2015, Congress enacted CISA 2015 to enable the sharing of cybersecurity information among private, federal, state, local, territorial, and tribal entities. In doing so, Congress took several steps, including:

Exempting entities engaging in such sharing from antitrust liability for disclosing cybersecurity information among private entities; liability for monitoring internal systems for cybersecurity purposes; liability for disclosing personal information related to a cybersecurity threat; and disclosure under federal, state, tribal, or local freedom of information laws, open government laws, open meetings laws, open records laws, or sunshine laws related to shared information;

Preventing entities from waiving privilege and trade secret protection for shared information; and

Limiting federal agencies’ use of shared information to cybersecurity purposes.

The extension of CISA 2015 restores certainty that entities sharing cyber threat information will be protected and that their designations of disclosed information as commercial, financial, and proprietary will be honored. But that extension may be short-lived; the renewal is part of legislation that reopened the U.S. federal government, and that renewal extends CISA 2015 only until January 30 of next year.

AC/DC blasted from the speakers. Red, white and blue flags flapped in the wind. Crowds whooped and cheered as the man of the hour lamented the surge of migrants across the border.

“This country isn’t falling apart,” he bellowed. “It is being shot to pieces, by bullets.”

You’d be forgiven for assuming this was a rally for U.S. President Donald Trump. After all, the U.S. president's name adorned plenty of campaign merch.

But this eruption of visceral rage at immigrants and incumbents took place in Santiago, Chile, at the final campaign event for Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian candidate gaining traction before Sunday's presidential election in Chile, where rising fears of uncontrolled migration have pushed everyone in this race — even the governing coalition's Communist candidate, Jeannette Jara — to the right.

Kaiser is “the only one with a firm hand, the only one who can pull us out of the United Nations, close the borders to all the Venezuelan criminals and throw them in prison in El Salvador,” said Claudia Belmonte, 50, peering out from beneath the brim of a red baseball cap emblazoned with Kaiser’s promise to “Make Chile Great Again.”

Such demands for a “mano dura,"" a “firm hand,” against crime and disorder have reshaped Chilean politics as transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua surged across porous borders from crisis-stricken Venezuela and elsewhere in recent years, importing kidnappings, contract killings and other violent crimes previously unseen in one of Latin America's safest nations.

“People in Chile never had problems with foreigners. But you hear about a gang burying someone alive in your neighborhood and it changes you,” said Carlos Jadué, 49, a lemon vendor in central Santiago. “I'm not racist. I see new people coming in. And I see new crimes.”

The anti-migrant backlash has transformed a nation that just four years ago elected the bright young hope of the Latin American left, President Gabriel Boric, a millennial former protest leader who handily defeated the ultraconservative lawyer José Antonio Kast in 2021 with vows to “bury neoliberalism"" in response to demands of the nation's 2019 social upheaval.

This time around, experts say Chile's nativist fears over illegal immigration give Kast a better shot, even if he's unlikely to clinch the 50% of votes needed to win outright in Sunday’s first round. Polls show Kast facing off against Jara in a runoff on Dec. 14.

In Santiago, there are few vestiges left of the 2019 mass protests against endemic social inequities — known here as “el estallido” or “the explosion"" — in which as many as a million Chileans marched to vent a generation’s worth of economic and political grievances.

One is the stone plinth in the city's Plaza Italia, the central square where protesters battled nightly with police, torching buildings and braving bird shot. The bronze statue of 19th-century Chilean war hero Gen. Manuel Baquedano was defaced, then taken down for what authorities promised would be a quick restoration.

Four years later, the stone plinth, scarred by anti-government graffiti, remains empty and freighted with symbolism. For protesters, it's a reminder of all that's unaddressed. Neoliberalism is alive and well. Chile retains the 1980 constitution adopted by military dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet after Boric twice failed to change it.

For critics, it's a reminder of the lawlessness that struck Chile, a stable prosperous nation that long distinguished itself from its more volatile neighbors. Many Chileans trace their feelings of insecurity back to those days of civil strife, when everything they knew about their country burst.

“I was left-wing until the ‘estadillo,' when I watched chaos taking over our streets,” said Sebastian Jaramillo, a 36-year-old graphic designer at Kaiser’s rally on Wednesday. “I started watching YouTube videos about the decline of our country, I got politicized.”

In the riled-up rallies of Kaiser and Kast, some recognize a familiar revulsion at the centrist consensus that has held sway since the dictatorship.

“The anger from the ‘estallido’ didn’t disappear. It stayed, it festered,” said Juan Medina, 40, who works at a theater in downtown Santiago. “Instead of turning our anger on inequality, the economic system, the political class, we’ve redirected it toward migrants.”

Throughout the campaign, Chile’s presidential contenders have seemed most intent on trying to outdo each other with ruthless anti-immigrant proposals inspired by Trump and El Salvador’s iron-fisted president, Nayib Bukele.

It's not only on the right.

Jara of the Communist Party — the only left-wing front-runner, as Boric can't run for a consecutive term — has also leaned heavily into a law-and-order message, promising to build new prisons and deploy more force to Chile’s borders.

Jara advocates raising the minimum wage, but, in stark contrast to Boric, proposes no changes to Chile's market-led economic model. The former labor minister and union leader dropped plans to nationalize lithium and copper mining. Her platform calls insecurity her “top priority.”

“Observers say this is an election between two extremes — a communist candidate, two far-right candidates,” said Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile. “But actually, there’s quite a lot of consensus on things like immigration.”

Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, even in cases of rape, has kept quiet about his conservative values this time around.

His German-born father’s Nazi party membership has hardly come up. After two failed presidential bids, Kast has found his tough-on-migration platform holds more appeal than his culture war battles. Yet for all his vows to deport tens of thousands of people and build a giant border wall, Kast looks moderate next to Kaiser.

Kast and Kaiser “are going to clean Chile up, so it can be a first-world country,” said Alatina Velázquez, 20, a fashion design student who said she lost two close friends in the last two years to gang violence.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/6a9ea54d-38a8-4049-b528-30c13851d432/wirestory_96226f5e4b94779e97e6d079813c46f3_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-15 12:57:52.165258

The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.","NEW YORK -- When he first came to the United States after escaping civil war in Sierra Leone and spending almost a decade in a refugee camp, Dauda Sesay had no idea he could become a citizen. But he was told that if he followed the rules and stayed out of trouble, after some years he could apply. As a U.S. citizen, he would have protection.

It’s what made him decide to apply: the premise — and the promise — that when he became a naturalized American citizen, it would create a bond between him and his new home. He would have rights as well as responsibilities, like voting, that, as he was making a commitment to the country, the country was making one to him.

“When I raised my hand and took the oath of allegiance, I did believe that moment the promise that I belonged,” said Sesay, 44, who first arrived in Louisiana more than 15 years ago and now works as an advocate for refugees and their integration into American society.

But in recent months, as President Donald Trump reshapes immigration and the country's relationship with immigrants, that belief has been shaken for Sesay and other naturalized citizens. There's now fear that the push to drastically increase deportations and shift who can claim America as home, through things like trying to end birthright citizenship, is having a ripple effect.

What they thought was the bedrock protection of naturalization now feels more like quicksand.

Some are worried that if they leave the country, they will have difficulties when trying to return, fearful because of accounts of naturalized citizens being questioned or detained by U.S. border agents. They wonder: Do they need to lock down their phones to protect their privacy? Others are hesitant about moving around within the country, after stories like that of a U.S. citizen accused of being here illegally and detained even after his mother produced his birth certificate.

Sesay said he doesn't travel domestically anymore without his passport, despite having a REAL ID with its federally mandated, stringent identity requirements.

Immigration enforcement roundups, often conducted by masked, unidentifiable federal agents in places including Chicago and New York City, have at times included American citizens in their dragnets. One U.S. citizen who says he was detained by immigration agents twice has filed a federal lawsuit.

Adding to the worries, the Justice Department issued a memo this summer saying it would ramp up efforts to denaturalize immigrants who’ve committed crimes or are deemed to present a national security risk. At one point during the summer, Trump threatened the citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, who naturalized as a young adult.

The atmosphere makes some worried to speak about it publicly, for fear of drawing negative attention to themselves. Requests for comment through several community organizations and other connections found no takers willing to go on the record other than Sesay.

In New Mexico, state Sen. Cindy Nava says she's familiar with the fear, having grown up undocumented before getting DACA — Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected people brought to the U.S. as children from being deported — and gaining citizenship through her marriage. But she hadn't expected to see so much fear among naturalized citizens.

“I had never seen those folks be afraid ... now the folks that I know that were not afraid before, now they are uncertain of what their status holds in terms of a safety net for them,"" Nava said.

What citizenship has meant, and who was included, has expanded and contracted over the course of American history, said Stephen Kantrowitz, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said while the word “citizen” is in the original Constitution, it is not defined.

“When the Constitution is written, nobody knows what citizenship means,” he said. “It’s a term of art, it comes out of the French revolutionary tradition. It sort of suggests an equality of the members of a political community, and it has some implications for the right to be a member of that political community. But it is ... so undefined.”

The first naturalization law passed in 1790 by the new country’s Congress said citizenship was for any “free white person” of good character. Those of African descent or nativity were added as a specific category to federal immigration law after the ravages of the Civil War in the 19th century, which was also when the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution to establish birthright citizenship.

In the last years of the 19th century and into the 20th century, laws were put on the books limiting immigration and, by extension, naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1924 effectively barred people from Asia because they were ineligible for naturalization, being neither white nor Black. That didn't change until 1952, when an immigration law removed racial restrictions on who could be naturalized. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.

American history also includes times when those who had citizenship had it taken away, like after the 1923 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. vs. Bhagat Singh Thind. That ruling said that Indians couldn't be naturalized because they did not qualify as white and led to several dozen denaturalizations. At other times, it was ignored, as in World War II, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps.

“Political power will sometimes simply decide that a group of people, or a person or a family isn’t entitled to citizenship,” Kantrowitz said.

In this moment, Sesay says, it feels like betrayal.

“The United States of America — that’s what I took that oath of allegiance, that’s what I make commitment to,” Sesay said. “Now, inside my home country, and I’m seeing a shift. ... Honestly, that is not the America I believe in when I put my hand over my heart.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7b531e55-49fa-4d4b-bd1e-1aa9e7c5faf6/wirestory_116b8bb3dd4444abf4bdcbc266bed48c_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-15 10:59:42.087031

Two of those New Jersey Democrats also announced that they’ll soon be leaving D.C., for very different reasons.

Here’s some of what New Jersey’s members of Congress did in Washington this week.

Reopen your mind

For nearly two months, Democrats insisted that in order for them to vote to reopen the government, Republicans had to work with them to extend ACA subsidies set to expire at the end of this year. For those same two months, Republicans insisted that in order for any negotiations to happen, Democrats needed to reopen the government.

It was a Catch-22 that was at last resolved on Sunday evening, when eight Senate Democrats relented on their filibuster and gave their blessing to a bill that funds the government through January 2026. (The bill also includes three full-year FY2026 appropriations bills.) In exchange, Senate Republican leaders have promised a vote on ACA subsidies, though no similar promise was made in the House.

The bill passed the Senate on Monday and the House on Wednesday – and earned zero votes from New Jersey Democrats in either chamber. Senator Andy Kim called it a “disgrace,” Senator Cory Booker said the Democratic Party needs “new leaders” – perhaps a shot at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who voted against the bill but has still borne a lot of intraparty criticism – and even Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-Tenafly), a Problem Solver who spent the House’s hiatus working to find a funding compromise, voted no.

“They didn’t give the American people more affordable health care, so they don’t get my vote,” Gottheimer said. “When they work with us on a bipartisan solution, then I’m in.”

But stuck in the minority, their objections ultimately were moot; the bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Wednesday night, officially bringing the 43-day shutdown – the longest in U.S. history – to an end.

“Now, it’s time to move forward and focus on what matters: lowering costs, strengthening our economy, and securing America’s future,” Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) said. “That is the work the American people sent us here to do, and that is exactly what I will continue to fight for.”

Pinky swear?

Gottheimer and a bipartisan crew of fellow House members are now working on the next step: getting the House to pass some form of ACA subsidy fix. Gottheimer joined 31 other representatives, among them Reps. Kean and Jeff Van Drew (R-Dennis), on a letter to Senate leaders today asking for House members to be included when the Senate hashes out the ACA proposal it will vote on next month.

“We kindly request that you include both House Democrats and Republicans in the legislative process leading to the promised health care reform vote in December,” the letter states. “If we work together, our hope is that the bill will not only achieve a sixty-vote majority in the Senate, but will also then move to the House for immediate consideration and passage.”

Kean and Van Drew have both been at the forefront of a charge within their caucus to get an extension passed; Van Drew has said that if Republicans don’t figure something out, there will be electoral hell to pay from voters in 2026. On the night the funding bill passed, he said his task now will be to secure a vote on an extension and get it signed into law.

“I wish that we had done more, as far as locking in something,” he said. “But we didn’t, and we’ve got to open government up. As soon as we open up, we’ve got to press hard to get something done.”

But Democrats – who unanimously support extending the Covid-era subsidies – are skeptical of any GOP promises. “Republicans don’t give a damn. I think that’s what the reality is,” Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark) said. “I wouldn’t take a pinky-swear promise from them.”

12…

12th district Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing) made some unexpected news this week: this term in Congress will be her last.

The 80-year-old congresswoman was first elected in 2014, succeeding Rep. Rush Holt (D-Hopewell) and becoming the first woman of color to represent New Jersey in Congress. Her time in Washington has included holding Congress’s purse-strings on the powerful Appropriations Committee, wailing on Donald Trump and his Republican allies, and championing myriad progressive causes – even those that aren’t immediately popular within her own party.

So why is she heading for the exit? In her retirement announcement, the congresswoman said it’s time to “to pass the torch to the next leader” who will fight for the same fights she’s taken on in Washington. (She was also unable to vote this week due to a herniated disc that kept her in New Jersey, but her office said she’s set to return to D.C. next week.)

“I made this decision with tremendous thought and reflection, and through many personal conversations with my husband Bill and my family,” Watson Coleman said. “I am confident it is the right choice for me and my family who have graciously sacrificed by my side when I placed serving our community above all else and I can truly say, I am at peace with my decision. “

The announcement has created a rapidly developing Democratic primary for her safely blue, incredibly diverse district – two candidates have already launched campaigns and dozens more are considering it – but that’s outside the purview of this dispatch.

11…

11th district Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-Montclair), meanwhile, is about to trade in that title for a new one: governor.

Sherrill doesn’t have to leave Congress until January 20, when her term as governor begins, but she announced on Wednesday that she’ll move that timeline far forward, submitting her letter of resignation next week. (The exact timing of her departure is still in flux.) That will allow a much quicker special election schedule to replace her, with her successor – nearly a dozen Democrats and one Republican have announced campaigns for her seat – likely taking office sometime in April.

In her final speech on the House floor, Sherrill warned her constituents and her soon-to-be-former colleagues not to “give up the ship,” in Navy parlance, and to continue fighting against the policies of the Republican majority.

“To my colleagues: do not let this body become a ceremonial red stamp for an administration that takes food away from children and rips healthcare away from people,” Sherrill said.

Sherrill did stick around long enough, however, to cast a vote against the government funding bill, calling it “malpractice”; her signature will also still count towards the 218 needed for a discharge petition on the Jeffrey Epstein files.

10…

10th district Rep. McIver’s fight against assault charges got handed a major setback this week, after a federal judge rejected her bid to dismiss the charges.

McIver’s attorneys had argued that the charges, which stem from a brief melee at Newark’s Delaney Hall immigrant detention center in May, should be dismissed for two reasons. For one, they said, the indictment is inextricably tied to McIver’s official oversight duties as a member of Congress, which are protected by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause; for another, the Trump administration was selectively and vindictively choosing to prosecute McIver in retaliation for her political views.

But U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper rejected both arguments, writing that there was not sufficient evidence of Trump targeting McIver specifically and that her actions did not count as protected legislative business. “No genuine legislative purpose was advanced by Defendant’s alleged conduct,” Semper wrote.

McIver said in a statement that she was “disappointed” by the ruling, and her lawyer, Paul Fishman, indicated that more legal action may be coming, perhaps including an appeal.

“Although it is apparent that the court gave the motions thoughtful consideration, we believe the decisions are wrong,” Fishman said. “It is clear this administration is treating Congresswoman McIver’s actions differently than the actions of those who are on their side. It is also clear that this prosecution is designed to chill the Congresswoman’s lawful authority to conduct oversight and hold the administration to account. We are currently evaluating next steps.”

Andy Kim objects to Illinois politicians acting like New Jersey politicians

In the midst of the government funding drama on the House floor on Wednesday, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Washington) picked an unexpected fight with Rep. Chuy García (D-Illinois), filing a motion of disapproval against her fellow Democrat. Gluesenkamp Perez’s issue: García had initially filed to run for re-election, but ended his campaign at the last minute right as his chief of staff submitted petitions to run for his seat, guaranteeing that she would be the only Democrat to make the ballot.

That sure sounds like something that might happen in New Jersey, though the preferred method in the Garden State is typically to win the primary and then drop out, allowing the local party to choose your replacement. Senator Kim, who has his own history of fighting against backroom political deals, said on social media that García’s scheme was “undemocratic and should not be allowed.”

“Standing against corruption means standing up no matter which political party violates,” Kim wrote. “The House should condemn and steps need to be taken to restore the people’s right to choose.”

Not everyone in New Jersey politics agrees, though; Politico quoted Rep. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City) as being critical of Perez’s tactics, saying that “there are other ways to handle it, and I don’t think this is the best moment if it’s something you feel compelled to do.”

The Masked Agent

In response to reports around the country of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers making arrests without identifying who they are, Rep. Menendez led a letter with 53 of his colleagues to top Department of Homeland Security officials demanding that enforce federal law regarding officer identification.

“We’re deeply troubled by incidents across the country in which ICE and other federal immigration enforcement officers reportedly failed to identify themselves appropriately during arrests,” the letter states. “Even more concerning, these arrests often occur while officers are concealed behind masks without any visible identifier such as a name tag or badge number, compounding confusion and reducing transparency.”

“Such routine violations of legal protections demonstrate the Trump Administration’s disregard for immigrant rights and intentional use of intimidation tactics that undermine public trust and stoke fear in our communities,” it continues.

Also signing onto the letter were New Jersey Reps. Donald Norcross (D-Camden), Frank Pallone (D-Long Branch), and Nellie Pou (D-North Haledon).",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sherrill-Pallone-hug-1024x744.png,N,,2025-11-15 15:57:10.774893

England and Wales are facing a prison capacity crisis. This issue gained public attention recently when the Government implemented a swathe of early releases to ease pressure last summer.[1] But our male prisons have been operating with only a 5% vacancy margin for several years and are no better now. As of October this year, prisons in England and Wales were operating at 98% capacity.[2]

One in every eight inmates housed on the prison estate in England and Wales is a foreign national offender (FNO), which equates to around 10,800 offenders.[3] With the FNO population in English and Welsh prisons taking up 12% of capacity, their removal presents an opportunity to alleviate prison capacity problems significantly. Currently, these offenders can be removed from this country through various means, including the early removal scheme, the facilitated return scheme and prisoner transfer agreements.

But there are complexities that surround these processes that mean progress in deporting FNOs is slower than it could be. The interpretation of articles in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) through domestic human rights law has been a significant barrier to removal: between April 2008 and June 2021 6,042 FNOs had their removal appeal allowed at the First Tier Tribunal with nearly 40% of these doing so on human rights grounds.[4]

Increasing the deportation of FNOs represents a significant opportunity not only to relieve prison capacity problems, but to deliver a significant saving to the taxpayer. Onward analysis reveals that the average annual cost of FNOs in our prison population is much higher than previous estimates: on average £537 million a year since 2019.[5] The process of removing FNOs needs urgent acceleration, and this paper sets out practical measures to achieve this.

Prison capacity in England and Wales

The English and Welsh prison system is at a dangerous tipping point. Prisons housing adult males, the vast majority of the prison population, have been operating at close to 95% capacity for several years. And in June 2024 the prison population rose to almost 88,000, putting adult male prison capacity under severe pressure as it reached 97-99.7%.[6] As of October this year, prisons in England and Wales were again operating at 98% capacity.[7]

How did our prisons get to this point?

There has been significant pressure on the courts with a backlog in cases increasing before 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic intensified this. In particular, the most serious cases being heard in the Crown Court had already increased by 23% from 33,290 cases in March 2019 to 41,045 in March 2020 as the pandemic began.[8]

Figure 1: Number of open cases in the Crown Court 2016-2025[9]

As shown in Figure 1, the impact of pandemic restrictions can be seen with the backlog of cases increasing a further 46% to 59,928 in September 2021. And this has only worsened since. When restrictions were lifted, there was a sharp increase in the prison population as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Prison population and capacity in England and Wales 2015-2025[10]

The most recent figures show that by the end of March 2025, the Crown Court backlog reached 76,957 – an 11% increase on March 2024. The Magistrates’ court backlog also increased by 13% relative to the previous year, reaching 310,304 in March 2025. This means that there is now a larger population being held in custody on remand awaiting trial.[11]

Tougher and therefore longer sentences have also been rising since 2023. In 2012, the average prison sentence was a year and six weeks, which increased to a year and nine months by 2023.[12] And prison capacity has not increased over the same period. In 2024, excluding offenders recalled to jail after early release, prisoners with sentences of four or more years made up 72% of the prison population. This is compared to just 54% in 2009.[13]

Figure 3: Types of crimes 2020-2024[14]

There has been a sharp increase in offenders serving sentences for violent crimes which attract longer sentences since 2022, as shown in Figure 3 – the number of violent offences has increased by nearly a third since 2019. This has resulted in one in three prisoners being guilty of a violent offence. What’s more, the number of sexual offenders has increased by over 3,000 since March 2021.[15] Taken together, violent and sexual offenders make up more than half of all prisoners. Looking at the share of cautions and convictions among FNOs, the most represented crimes are drug offences, sexual offences, criminal damage and arson, and then fraud.[16]

In the last decade there has been a significant increase in the number of people recalled to prison after breaking the terms of their parole. Ministry of Justice data shows that between January and March 2025, there were 13,296 prisoner releases and 10,101 recalls – this means that for every four people released in the first quarter of 2025, a staggering three were recalled.[17]

Prison building and early release

The previous Government committed to delivering 20,000 new prison places by the mid-2020s. As of September 2024, only 6,518 new prison places have been added.[18]

The National Audit Office (NAO) identified several reasons for this delay: an over-ambitious timeline, weakness of governance and risk management, a lack of prioritisation from the Treasury, and a challenging economic and delivery environment. In particular, the NAO highlighted that given the time it takes to obtain planning permission to build new prisons, 20,000 new prison places in around five years was highly unrealistic. Rising costs and inflation also had a significant impact. Between January 2020 and February 2024, there was a 40% overall price rise which led to a near doubling of the cost per prison place for HMPP. This pushed total spending to £2.2 billion by March 2024.[19]

During the summer of 2024, the prison system came close to overflowing, prompting the current Labour Government to implement emergency early releases, reducing some offenders’ sentences to 40% of their original term.[20] Between September 2024 and June 2025, over 38,000 prisoners were freed early by the Government.[21]

Figure 4: Opinion on early release and prisons capacity[22]

Early release of prisoners is not a sustainable long-term solution to prison capacity issues – and it is highly unpopular with the public. Figure 4 shows a map of More in Common polling of public opinion of early release alongside prisons across the country and how close to capacity they are. This demonstrates a worrying picture.

Removing London, over 50% of the country disapproves of early releases. Some areas like the South West, North East and East Anglia register nearly 70% disapproval. And with prisons across the country between 95% and 100% capacity, early releases will become more and more frequent. Future scenes similar to August 2024 of released prisoners celebrating in the local area near the prison could create significant tension in communities.

Figure 5: Prison population and capacity projection in England and Wales by 2027[23]

Numerous projections, illustrated in Figure 5, indicate that by November 2027 at the latest, the prison population will exceed capacity, with estimated occupancy rates ranging from 101% to 113%. This underscores the pressing need for decisive action to prevent further early releases or the system reaching breaking point again.[24]

The number of erroneous early releases has increased at a staggering rate since 2024, as shown in Figure 6. While mistaken prison releases have been a long-standing issue as evidenced above, the spike since the current Government came to power is stark. The danger of this increased volume of mistaken early releases should not be underestimated and has been underscored in the last month with the release of two high-profile foreign national sex offenders. The former Chief Inspector of Prisons has said that the Government’s early release programme could be linked to a recent spike in cases.[25]

Figure 6 – Number of releases in error[26]

Foreign National Offenders

There is another route that the Government could take to free up space in prisons – improving the removal of FNOs. FNOs are individuals that are not British citizens and have been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK.

There are currently around 10,800 FNOs in prisons in England and Wales, which represents around 12% of the prison population.[27] As shown in Figure 7, the number of FNOs in our prisons is sharply increasing. There has been a 17% increase in the number of FNOs since 2019 and an almost 10% increase since the current Government came to power.[28]

Figure 7: Number of Foreign National Offenders in prison 2019-2024[29]

While many FNOs are housed across the general prison estate, there are also specific prisons that are exclusively used for FNOs. They are dedicated to offenders that are of interest to the Home Office who have between three and 36 months left to serve. Taken together, HMP Huntercombe, HMP Maidstone and HMP Morton Hall house nearly 1,400 FNOs – nearly a tenth of the total FNO population.[30]

If the current population of FNOs were to be removed from the prisons altogether, prisons in England and Wales would be operating at 86% capacity, compared to the 98% capacity they currently are.[31] While it is not feasible for the whole FNO population to be removed, this demonstrates the significance of the FNO population and the pressure it is putting on our prison capacity.

Figure 8 below shows the makeup of FNOs. The plurality of FNOs are Albanian citizens and this has been the case for several years. Polish, Romanian and Irish offenders follow closely.

Figure 8: Breakdown of Foreign National Offenders in prison 2019-2023[32]

With the FNO population in prisons in England and Wales taking up a significant proportion of capacity, their removal presents an opportunity to alleviate prison capacity significantly, preventing prisons being dangerously full.

It could also allow for significant savings on the amount the Government spends on foreign offenders, far beyond just the period the offender is in prison. Previous estimates have only looked at the cost of housing a prisoner for a year. For example, the TaxPayer’s Alliance calculated FNOs have cost around £600 million in the last year. It is worth noting that this figure is unusually high because the number of FNOs is beyond that of the Government’s official figures because offenders whose nationality was not recorded were assumed to be foreign born.[33] Other calculations that use the official FNO population statistics have estimated the cost to be around £530 million.[34]

Taking into consideration the cost of the prosecution process, prison time, court time and process, we have estimated the total cost of FNOs to the taxpayer at £3.2 billion since 2019/2020. And the cost has increased over the years, in particular since 2021/2022 as shown in Figure 9 below. Under the current Government, the cost of FNOs to the taxpayer is at an all-time high at almost £650 million per year – this is a 50% increase, over £200 million more, compared to 2019.[35]

Figure 9: Cost of Foreign National Offenders 2019-2025[36]

The Government finds itself in a precarious fiscal position with a £40 billion black hole and borrowing costs at a 27-year high.[37] There is little room for spending increases without tax rises. Onward analysis estimates that the cost of FNOs under this Government is equivalent to paying the salaries of over 20,000 new nurses or over 20,000 new teachers.[38] Likewise, it equates to the salaries of over 15,000 new police officers.[39] On the average starting salary, it is the same as the salaries of over 19,000 new prison officers.[40]

How can FNOs be removed?

Legal background

The legal backdrop to the removal of FNOs comes from two major pieces of legislation: the Immigration Act 1971 and the UK Borders Act 2007. The former originally intended for deportation to be discretionary in so far as, “a person would be liable to deportation if the Home Office decided it was conducive to the public good or a judge recommended it at the point of sentencing”. The latter places a statutory duty on the Home Secretary to make a deportation order on an FNO which has largely overtaken discretionary deportation decisions of the Immigration Act.[41]

Under the Borders Act, an FNO is defined as a “person who was not a British citizen or an Irish citizen who had been convicted of an offence in the UK and sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least 12 months”. This means that the discretionary power of deportation as outlined in the Immigration Act was converted into a duty in relevant cases.[42] Irish citizens are excluded in the legislative definition of an FNO owing to the longstanding Common Travel Area arrangements that mean the UK does not routinely deport Irish citizens. They are nevertheless counted as foreign nationals in statistics on the nationality of prisoners in English and Welsh prisons.

Deportation of FNOs is not automatic. Exemptions, outlined in section 33 of the Act, include whether the offender was under 18 at the time of the crime or if it would breach the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the UN Refugee Convention or the Council of Europe Convention Against Trafficking in Human Beings.

There are two articles of the ECHR in particular that are frequently cited: Article 3 and Article 8. The former prohibits deportation if “there is a real risk that the person would be tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment”.[43] Article 8 protects the right to “respect for private and family life”. The articles are written into UK law under the Human Rights Act 1998. It has since been established that Article 8 can be used to challenge immigration decisions.[44]

These articles have different legislative footings. Article 3 is an absolute right, meaning it cannot be interfered with under any circumstances. Article 8 is a qualified right which means its application can be restricted if it is necessary for a legitimate aim, such as protecting public safety or other people’s rights. Maintaining effective immigration controls has been classified as a legitimate reason for interfering in Article 8. Butit is the decision of a judge to decide whether deportation is a proportionate interference with the rights awarded under Article 8. The judge must weigh up the rights of the individual against the interests of the respective country.

The precedent for how Article 8 is applied in the case of an FNO in the UK comes from two landmark cases: the 2004 R (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department and the 2007 case Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department.[45] These cases saw the shift from deferring to the judgement of the Home Office on whether a deportation or removal breached a person’s rights under the Human Rights Act to an independent assessment by immigration tribunal judges on the facts and proportionality of each case.

There were several key principles that were established in these cases. In Razgar, there were five stages of analysis that were established and then later endorsed in Huang. These were:

Is there interference with private or family life?

Is it in accordance with the law?

Is there a legitimate aim?

Is there interference necessary in a democratic society?

Is it proportionate to that aim?

In Huang, it was held that the immigration appeal tribunal must decide whether removal is proportionate under Article 8. Secondly, the court in this case established that tribunals should weigh the public interest in immigration control against the individual’s rights under Article 8. And finally, Huang confirmed that the immigration tribunal is the primary forum for deciding Article 8 proportionality.

Following the UK’s exit from the EU, FNOs from the EU are subject to different legal routes depending on the circumstances of their crime. EU citizens and family members with residence rights under the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 are exempt from automatic removal if their offence was undertaken before 31 December 2020.

Removal is instead decided under a framework derived from EU free movement law, which offers stronger protections against deportation. No particular length of prison sentence triggers deportation. With the exception of Irish citizens, if an EU citizen has committed a crime after 31 December 2020, they are liable to automatic deportation.

Prisons refer all cases involving FNOs to the Home Office’s Foreign National Offenders Returns Command (FNORC). An FNO who is not eligible for automatic deportation under the Borders Act can be considered on the grounds of their deportation being conducive to the public good. Deportation can be pursued on the ground of criminality if the person:

“has received a custodial sentence of 12 months or more for a single conviction for a single offence in the UK or overseas

has received combined sentences totalling 12 months or more in the UK or overseas

has been convicted in the UK or overseas of an offence which has caused serious harm

is a persistent offender”.[46]

Removal can also be pursued for the following reasons:

The offender is a threat to national security,

Court recommended deportation,

The person’s involvement in gun or serious drug crime regardless of the length of sentence received,

Regardless of if the person has not yet been convicted of a criminal offence, if there is evidence that the FNO’s conduct or presence in the UK has or will cause serious harm,

Involvement in a sham marriage.

Routes to removal

Currently, offenders can be removed from this country through various means including deportation; the early removal scheme; the facilitated return scheme; prisoner transfer agreements; and the tariff-expired removal scheme.

The early removal scheme is available to FNOs eligible for removal that are serving a fixed-term prison sentence and allows for the removal of FNOs at an “earlier point than would otherwise be possible for the sole purpose of removal or deportation from the UK”.[47] Once deported they cannot legally return to the UK, and are no longer subject to imprisonment and are free once back in their home country. The Home Office considers all cases, but in most cases prison governors are responsible for authorisation. Any prisoner can now be considered so long as their offence is not terror related. Similarly, the Tariff-Expired Removal Scheme applies to FNOs serving indeterminate sentences.[48]

FNOs under this scheme can be released up to four years before their earliest release date. This was originally 12 months, but it was increased in 2022 and has most recently been increased to 48 months this year under the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.[49] So, the minimum pre-removal custodial period is now 30% compared to the previous 50%. The Government has recently stated their intention to remove the minimum requirement of sentence completion, meaning that FNOs could face immediate removal in the Sentencing Bill, which is likely to pass early next year.[50]

The facilitated return scheme is a voluntary programme run by the Home Office which offers money to help FNOs to resettle in their home country on the condition that they withdraw any appeals or applications to remain in the UK. This scheme is available to all FNOs liable for removal. A participant in the scheme can receive £1,500 if they are serving a custodial sentence or £750 if they have completed their sentence. The scheme is designed to “encourage FNOs to leave the UK at the earliest possible opportunity, thereby reducing the resources and costs associated with time spent in prison and immigration detention”.[51]

Prisoner transfer agreements allow for FNOs serving custodial sentences to be transferred to see out the rest of their sentence in their home country. This can be carried out if there is a reciprocal prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and the respective country. The UK has 110 such prisoner transfer agreements – they differ between countries with some requiring the consent of the prisoner, and some not.[52] Countries include Albania, France, Romania, Pakistan, Poland and the United States. Consent is generally required for these transfer agreements, but not always.

Figure 10: FNO deportations since 2010[53]

Removal history

The number of FNOs removed from the UK averaged around 5,500 per year during the period from 2010 to 2019. FNO returns reached a peak in 2016 at 6,437, subsequently falling to below 3,000 per year during the pandemic in 2020 to 2021. Since then, returns of FNOs have been gradually increasing, although in the latest year they were still 18% below the 2016 peak.[54]

The early removal scheme is responsible for around two fifths of FNO deportations from the UK. Between January 2010 and June 2022, around 12,800 people were removed under the facilitated return scheme, meaning it featured in approximately one in every five removals during that period.[55]

In total, the UK has removed 945 people to 50 countries and territories under prisoner transfer agreements from 2010 to 2023.[56] The net effect on prison spaces will be smaller, as some prisoners come to the UK from other countries under the same agreements.

In the year ending June 2025, there were 5,265 FNO returns, representing a 16% increase on the previous year – 48% were EU nationals and 52% were non-EU nationals. And in the period between 5 July 2024 and 31 January 2025, the early release scheme was responsible for over half of deportations.[57]

Figure 11: Breakdown of FNO returns by nationality 2021-2025[58]

As shown in Figure 11, FNO returns have been increasing in recent years. Removals of Albanian offenders have been the largest group of returns. They were steadily increasing until 2024 and took a slight downturn in the most recent year ending June 2025.

Building on the 2021 prisoner transfer agreement, the previous Conservative government signed a deal to send 200 Albanian prisoners to serve the balance of their sentences in Albania. In return, the UK helps Albania modernise its prisons. The deal outlined that the total cost for the Ministry of Justice to modernise Albanian prisons was around £8 million over two years.[59] This equated to £32 per prisoner per day – a significant saving compared to £109 per Albanian prisoner per day in prisons in England and Wales.[60]

As shown in Figure 12, between April 2008 and June 2021, just over a tenth of appeals against removal succeeded on human rights grounds. Home Office management data records 21,521 appeals in that period, of which 6,042 succeeded. Of the successful appeals, nearly 2,400 were successful on human rights grounds only.

Most of these are thought to be Article 8 cases as indicated by a subsequent review. Between 2016 and 2021, of 1,011 appeals against deportation by FNOs that were allowed on a human rights basis, nearly three-quarters were allowed solely on Article 8 grounds.[61]

Figure 12: FNO appeals against deportation 2008-2021[62]

Removals and the ECHR

While the UK’s future as a signatory of the ECHR continues to be debated, there are steps that can be taken to apply its protections more proportionately to domestic cases. The courts must also ensure that its application to protect the rights of FNOs is not infringing on the rights of UK citizens. In other words, if an FNO appealed deportation due to an infringement on their Convention rights under the Human Rights Act, would this jeopardise the safety of the public?

The Conservative party recently announced its intention to withdraw from the ECHR when in government and repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. This presents the opportunity for an entirely new legal framework free from having to align with Articles 3 or 8 that could radically increase deportations. However, the Labour Government has stated that it will not take the UK out of the ECHR. With over three and a half years until the next General Election must come and the prisons capacity crisis showing no signs of abating in the meantime, it is crucial to consider what other legislative changes could go some way towards increasing successful deportations of FNOs while the UK remains a signatory to ECHR.

As outlined above, Article 8 is a qualified right that was incorporated into the Human Rights Act from the ECHR. So, while the application of Article 3 cannot be changed as long as the UK remains in the ECHR, the Government can restrict the application of Article 8. And given that nearly three-quarters of appeals against removal that were granted to FNOs between 2008-2021 were on the grounds of Article 8, changing its application could radically increase FNO removals.

The Human Rights Act states that,

“There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”[63]

Looking at FNOs, there is a strong argument that interference with Article 8 would be in the interest of public safety, the prevention of disorder and crime, and for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

The Government has done this before in 2014 and the current Government is in the process of building on this. The Cameron Government’s Immigration Act 2014 changed how Article 8 applications are handled, instructing courts and tribunals to prioritise the public interest in maintaining immigration control over an individual’s right to private and family life. This legislation also made it harder for FNOs to successfully challenge deportation with sentences of four or more years requiring “very compelling circumstances” and for shorter sentences, the claim needs to outweigh the public interest.[64]

Exceptions to deportation were also established in this legislation, including long-term lawful residence and integration for private life and where deportation would be ‘unduly harsh’ for a partner or child of the offender in question. It is important to note that ‘unduly harsh’ does not mean uncomfortable, inconvenient, undesirable or difficult.[65]

Recommendations and conclusion

Recommendations

Recommendation 1 – The Government should introduce tougher legislation to tighten the application of Article 8 regardless of ECHR membership

Legislative action on the interpretation of Article 8 has been taken in the past, and the Government has signalled its intention to build on this. But it needs to go further. The rate at which Article 8 applications are successful clearly shows this is not working how it was intended. A recent example exemplifies this: an Albanian FNO’s deportation was halted partly because his son had an aversion to foreign chicken nuggets. An immigration tribunal cited it would be ‘unduly harsh’ for the FNO’s son to return to Albania due to his food sensitivities – the only example of which listed in court documents was “the type of chicken nuggets that are available abroad”.[66]

The de jure application of Article 8 under the Human Rights Act alone needs to be further restricted and de facto practice needs to be tightened to ensure it is being applied properly. The Government should therefore tighten the code published in 2014, making the following changes under Part 5A of the Immigration Act 2014:

1. Clarify that family life formed after conviction carries little weight – making Immigration Rule 398(c) statutory

Looking at whether deportation is proportionate under section 117C(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, considerations to family or private life should not be given any material weight after the commission of the offence unless exceptional circumstances exist.

In the Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60, it was stated that “The Rules are relevant to, but not determinative of, the proportionality assessment required by Article 8”.Putting this on a statutory footing would therefore give it equal weight to the Human Rights Act Article 8 clauses so it is binding rather than guiding.

It is worth noting that while Parliament can pass legislation instructing courts how to weight Article 8 rights relative to public safety, if it instructs to give no weight at all to relationships formed post-conviction (for example), it is likely the courts would make a declaration of incompatibility. And the UK government could get taken to Strasbourg itself for breach of Article 8 in a direct court action.

2. Replace “unduly harsh” with a higher threshold – align with ECtHR thresholds in Üner v Netherlands (2006), Jeunesse v Netherlands (2014) and Unuane v UK (2020)

As established above, if deportation would be ‘unduly harsh’ for a partner or child of the offender in question, this is a legitimate reason for appeal from the UK. But this precedent has been used in a disproportionate manner.

Üner v Netherlands (2006), Jeunesse v Netherlands (2014) and Unuane v UK (2020) cases looked at the proportionality of deporting FNOs in light of their private and family rights under Article 8 and the best interests of their children. They established that national authorities must conduct a proper proportionality assessment under Article 8.

In particular, Üner established the ‘Üner criteria’ which is a set of factors for courts to balance the public interest against private and family life rights – notably that removal can be allowed despite Article 8 rights if the public interstate is strong enough. And Unuane v UK ruled that the UK had breached Article 8 because it did not provide a proportionality assessment that “adequately considered the best interests of the children”. The case established that sufficient weight must be given to the negative impact on family life and that ‘unduly harsh’ requires a proper balancing exercise.

So, for the purpose of section 117C(5), the effect of deportation on a qualifying child or partner should be regarded as unduly harsh only if it would result in exceptional and irreversible harm to that person. The threshold should be raised so that it mirrors the exceptional and irreversible harm thresholds usually used in Strasbourg cases above.

3. Make very compelling circumstances apply to all offenders, not just those with 4 or more years sentences

A court or tribunal may not find that deportation is disproportionate under Article 8 unless satisfied that the case presents very exceptional circumstances compelling in nature, assessed against the strong public interest in removal.

Recommendation 2 – Introduce a Diversion Scheme

The Government should introduce a Diversion Scheme for lower-level crime committed by FNOs, in which these perpetrators are deported before they are convicted, as a substitute for incarceration. This should be applied to crimes that carry a sentence of up to two years.

There are some international examples of similar schemes. For example, the United States operates a pre-trial diversion policy under Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In this, the Attorney General may “permit any alien applicant for admission to withdraw his or her application for admission in lieu of removal proceedings… or expedited removal”.[67]

If the Department of Homeland Security uses an expedited removal, an inadmissibility bar (usually of five years) is applied to the alien in question. This carries no criminal conviction.[68] On the southern border, Border Patrol agents run a Consequence Delivery System (CDS) through which they find on the first apprehension of an alien, either federal prosecution or expedited removal are the most effective courses of action.[69]

The Home Office would retain information on FNO removal under the diversion policy so that FNOs in question would not be allowed to re-enter the country. This would not only prevent the FNO population in prisons in England and Wales from increasing, but it would also lessen the cost of FNOs.

Recommendation 3 – Remove the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme

Under the previous Conservative government, the minimum requirement was for an offender to have served 50% of their sentence, this was subsequently reduced to 30% under the Labour Government and is currently in place. As outlined above, the Government has signalled its intention to take this further and remove the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme altogether.

There is international precedent for this policy. For example, in Italy a ‘judicial expulsion’ can be ordered as an alternative to a current term of imprisonment or as a substitute penalty to imprisonment. Both are applicable to sentences of two years or less but only to crimes of irregular entry or stay in Italy.[70] In Spain, an FNO who has been sentenced to a custodial sentence of more than a year can have their sentence substituted by “expulsion from Spanish territory”. A judge can also order for part of the sentence to be served and substitute the rest of their sentence with expulsion.[71]

The Government should press ahead with the removal of the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme at an accelerated pace. Introducing this means that offenders who have not qualified for the Diversion Scheme, perhaps as they have chosen to go through the court process in the hopes they would not be convicted, can be removed at the earliest opportunity post-conviction. This policy alongside the Diversion Scheme allows for a comprehensive set of deportation levers for new offenders.

Recommendation 4 – Expand the ‘deport now, appeal later’ policy

Legislation passed in 2014 introduced the system known as ‘deport first, appeal later’. This policy means that the Government can send FNOs back to their home nation before they can appeal against the decision. They can be removed from the UK and they can have their appeal heard through a video link.

The current Government has recently expanded this list from the original eight countries to 23.[72] The list of countries that qualify for this policy are:

Albania

Angola

Australia

Belize

Botswana

Brunei

Bulgaria

Canada

Estonia

Finland

Guyana

India

Indonesia

Kenya

Kosovo

Latvia

Lebanon

Malaysia

Mauritius

Nigeria

Tanzania

Uganda

Zambia

Apart from Albania and Nigeria, this list omits the countries that are responsible for the majority of FNOs in prisons in England and Wales as shown in Figure 8. So, for this policy to be truly effective in decreasing the number of FNOs in prisons, this list needs to contain more of the countries outlined in Figure 8.

The remaining countries that make up the top 10 FNO nations are:

Poland

Romania

Ireland

Lithuania

Jamacia

Pakistan

Somalia

Portugal

The Home Secretary has the power to review and amend the countries on the deport now, appeal later list. Allowing removal before an appeal applies on a case-by-case basis, but being from a designated safe country strengthens the Home Secretary’s case for deportation. And Section 80AA list of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 already contains a list of countries the Home Office deems as safe.

Two actions should be taken to address this. First, the Home Office should put in place scheduled reviews of potential countries that could be added to the list. These reviews should happen at least bi-annually and should look at countries of interest:

The review should consider how effective adding this country would be in reducing the number of FNOs in English and Welsh prisons.

The safety of the home nation should be considered for both the FNO and possible dependants. The Home Office must ensure that there is no real risk of serious or irreversible harm to the individual or dependants if they are removed.

The viability of the home nation to conduct a fair remote appeal should be considered. This would include access to legal representation, sufficient internet access, diplomatic cooperation and arrangements, legal fairness and procedural safeguarding, and the assurance of no political interference.

Second, the remaining countries that are in the EU should be added immediately. Given that all EU countries fall within the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act’s safe countries, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, and Portugal are all already deemed as safe by the Home Office. And looking more broadly, based on 2023 prison population figures and the cost of incarceration in 2023, these FNOs cost the taxpayer over £124 million in 2023 alone. Therefore, as there is no real risk of serious harm to these offenders if they were deported and there is significant cost incurred by housing them in our prisons, these countries should be added to the ‘deport now, appeal later’ list at an accelerated pace.

Finally, for countries on this list that do not cooperate with the deportation policy, the Home Office should signal their intention to stop issuing new visas to countries to work as a diplomatic tool to encourage an increase in the volume of removals to these countries. There would be unintended consequences for non-offenders trying to seek legal settlement in the UK, so the Government should only stop issuing new visas as a last resort.

Conclusion

The prison population in England and Wales has reached dangerous levels in recent years and we cannot continue like this. And with inmate capacity across the prison estate at 98% in October 2025, the demand on our prisons is not being alleviated. There are several reasons our prisons have reached this tipping point: an increased backlog on the crown court due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tougher and therefore longer sentences have been on the rise since 2023 due to an increase in sentences for violent crimes, an increase in the number of offenders being recalled to prison, and a lack of prisons being built.

There is a clear group of inmates that should not be in our prisons: foreign national offenders (FNOs). Britain is not open to business for crime. But with English and Welsh prisons housing 10,800 foreign national offenders, one could be forgiven for thinking it is. What’s more, FNOs have cost the taxpayer over £3.2 billion since 2019 alone.

It is crucial for the integrity of our justice system, immigration system and tax system to send a clear message: if you come to this country and commit crime, you cannot stay. But on average, only 5,500 FNOs a year were removed from the UK between 2010 and 2019 – only around half of the annual FNO population.

Britain expects migrants to abide by our laws and should not tolerate it when that does not happen. So, more needs to be done to ensure this, and fast. This paper has identified several areas of FNO removal that need to change and recommends a series of pragmatic reforms to accelerate deportations:

The Government should introduce tougher legislation to tighten the application of Article 8 regardless of ECHR membership,

A Diversion Scheme should be introduced,

The Government should remove the minimum requirement for the early removal scheme,

And the Government should expand the ‘deport now, appeal later’ policy and stop issuing new visas to countries that do not comply.

In taking these steps and increasing the level of FNO deportations, this paper offers options to not only address the urgent issue of prison capacity but also alleviate the court backlog and reduce the associated cost.

Costings Methodological note

We used MoJ data to calculate the cost of legal aid per crime higher case.[73]

We used CPS data to calculate the average cost to the CPS of convicting someone.[74]

We used government data on the average cost per prisoner for each year from 2019/20 – 2023/24. We used an inflation calculator to estimate the cost for 2024/25 since figures are not available. Note that this data is the average cost per prisoner for a year’s stay in prison.

Used data from a written question in parliament to calculate cost to HMCTS for 1.4 sitting days.[75]

Found the number of FNOs per year (from 2019/20 – 2024/25).

Given that around 7% of determinate sentences come from the magistrates courts and the FNOs in question are all in prison, we have assumed they went through the Crown Courts.[76]

Adding the court costs for each year assumes that every FNO in prison undergoes a full court process within a given year – implying a custodial sentence of 12 months and no carryover. But given the average custodial sentence is 22 months, we have adjusted the total court costs by 55%.

To calculate how many new nurses salaries the 2024/25 FNO cost is equivalent to, we found the starting salary (£31,048).[77] And for new teachers, we took the average of the starting salaries for England excluding London (£31,650).[78] And for police officer salaries, we found the police starting salary (£40,776). And according to the Met Police, the average cost to train a police constable over the three year course is £210,000 – this includes wages and operating costs.[79] For prison officer salaries, we used HMPPS’ starting salary of £33,746.[80] These comparisons do not include non-pay associated costs.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the removal of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who was arrested in April, despite a judge attempting to help him evade arrest.

On April 18, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), assisted by deputized FBI law enforcement officials, carried out a targeted operation to arrest Flores-Ruiz, a violent criminal illegal alien at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. His laundry list of violent criminal charges includes strangulation and suffocation, battery, and domestic abuse.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested for obstructing the arrest of Flores-Ruiz. Judge Dugan intentionally directed ICE agents away from this criminal illegal alien to obstruct the arrest and try to help him evade arrest. Thankfully, our law enforcement chased down this violent illegal alien and arrested him. ICE removed this criminal on November 13, 2025.

“Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a previously removed illegal alien has a laundry list of violent criminal charges, including strangulation and suffocation, battery, and domestic abuse. Judge Hannah Dugan's actions to obstruct this violent criminal’s arrest take 'activist judge' to a whole new meaning,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Thanks to the brave men and women of ICE law enforcement, this criminal is OUT of our country. If you are here illegally and break the law, we will hunt you down, arrest you, and remove you from our country. That's a promise.”

Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem.
Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules, not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.
The court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.
But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.","The Transportation Department's new restrictions that would severely limit which immigrants can get commercial driver's licenses to drive a semitrailer truck or bus have been put on hold by a federal appeals court.

The court in the District of Columbia ruled Thursday that the rules Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced in September a month after a truck driver not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people can't be enforced right now.

The court said the federal government didn't follow proper procedure in drafting the rule and failed to ""articulate a satisfactory explanation for how the rule would promote safety."" The court said the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's own data shows that immigrants who hold these licenses account for roughly 5% of all commercial driver's licenses but only about 0.2% of all fatal crashes, the court said.

Duffy has been pressing this issue in California because the driver in the Florida crash received a license in California, and an audit of that state's records showed that many immigrants received licenses in California that were valid long after their work permits expired. Earlier this week, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses because of that problem. Those licenses were invalidated under the older existing rules, not by the new proposed restrictions affected by this court order.

The court ruling focused on procedural issues such as whether the Transportation Department properly consulted with states before issuing the new rules.

The new restrictions on these licenses would only allow immigrants who hold three specific classes of visas to be eligible to get the licenses. States would also have to verify an applicant's immigration status in a federal database. The licenses would be valid for up to one year unless the applicant's visa expires sooner.

Under the new rules, only 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizens who have commercial licenses would qualify for them, which would only be available to drivers who have an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa. H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2b is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won't be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers would be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.

Catholic, Buddhist, Methodist, Lutheran and Unitarian faith leaders and members of their congregations gathered by candlelight to pray, sing hymns and share words of hope.

The service, hosted by Parish Family 45, coincided with the feast day of St. Frances Cabrini, the first U.S. citizen declared a saint and patron saint of immigrants.

Parish Family 45 combines three Catholic churches in Vancouver — Our Lady of Lourdes, St. James and St. Joseph. Carol Boyden, along with Dave Griffin and Charlene Stapleton, organized the event as a part of St. Joseph’s life, justice and peace organization.

Organizers chose the courthouse as the location for the prayer service to reinforce that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement isn’t acting legally, Boyden said.

“In my mind it is the ultimate irony for what we’re seeing in terms of (ICE) ignoring laws and everything else and dragging people away,” Boyden said.

“That’s what it means to me — people getting together and standing up for compassion, understanding and human rights,” Levy said.

Greg Stone, St. Joseph’s music director, played guitar and sang hymns on the courthouse steps.

“Just helping to lift hearts in a way that unites us through something, that is a real privilege for me,” Stone said.

In between hymns and prayers, Maribel Ramirez from St. Joseph spoke about how ICE activity is affecting the community.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the lawsuit in July accusing the administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people in Southern California during its ongoing immigration crackdown. Immigrant advocates accused immigration officials of detaining someone based on their race, carrying out warrantless arrests, and denying detainees access to legal counsel at a holding facility in downtown LA.

Judge Maame E. Frimpong in Los Angeles said the ruling builds on a temporary order in July that required the government to provide detainees with access to free confidential phone calls with their lawyers.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The judge said that the plaintiffs had provided evidence that the government had not fully abided by the July order.

It required the detention facility to be open for attorney visitation seven days per week, for a minimum of eight hours per day on weekdays and a minimum of four hours per day on weekends and holidays. While the government has complied with that, the court also required officials to notify the plaintiffs in the lawsuit within four hours if they needed to close the detention facility for any reason, and that the closure not stretch longer than “reasonably necessary.”

“The Court has examined all of the new evidence presented by both sides and decides once again that the federal government is partially blocking access to lawyers,” Frimpong wrote in her order.

Mark Rosenbaum, an attorney with Public Counsel, said in an Oct. 23 hearing that lawyers were still having trouble meeting with their clients.

Attorneys did not begin receiving notice of any facility closures until Sep. 10. They often had to meet with clients with the door open and guards present, preventing the lawyers from having private conversations with clients. There have been instances where the facility was closed due to a peaceful protest that happened miles away in another city, Rosenbaum said.

Detainees have also been moved around frequently and without warning, sometimes from downtown Los Angeles to other locations that don't allow lawyer visits at all.

""By granting this preliminary injunction, the judge made clear that the government cannot lock people up and cut them off from their lawyers,” Rosenbaum said in a statement after the ruling.",https://images.wral.com/8a225a35-8c66-51c1-b21a-3cf607607fc6?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-11-15 15:57:38.729204

The GEO Group Operates Prisons in Australia, South Africa The GEO Group operates three prisons abroad: two in Australia and one in South Africa.","One of the largest private prison companies in the world, the GEO Group, is tied up in a Supreme Court battle as the company gains attention for contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

That case started in Aurora, which has played a key role in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan in more ways than one.

The GEO Group operates the Aurora Immigrant Processing Center, where ICE sends detainees facing deportation. The Florida-based company operates more than fifty similar facilities in the United States and abroad, managing more than 60,000 prisoners worldwide. It has a market value of about $2.4 billion and, at times, has ranked as the largest private prison company in the world, jostling with fellow U.S. federal contractor CoreCivic over the years.

On November 10, U.S. Supreme Court justices heard arguments in the case Menocal v. the GEO Group, which involves what kind of legal immunity the GEO Group has under federal prison contracts.

In 2014, Alejandro Menocal, a Mexican immigrant who lived in Golden before his arrest, worked in a dollar-a-day work program at the Aurora ICE facility while awaiting his deportation. Menocal was able to resolve his immigration case and stay in the U.S., but he wasn’t happy about the work program, alleging that the GEO Group underpaid him according to the state’s minimum wage laws, and violated forced labor and trafficking laws by threatening him and other inmates with solitary confinement for not doing tasks for free. In October 2014, other detainees from the Aurora facility signed onto a class-action lawsuit brought by Menocal against the GEO Group in the U.S. District Court of Colorado.

The GEO Group has argued that it is immune from the lawsuit because the company contracts with the federal government, and was only following ICE’s detailed instructions for how to handle detainees.

In 2015, a district court judge ruled that the GEO Group was not immune from the lawsuit, but claims that Menocal and others were underpaid were dismissed. The GEO Group still had to defend against alleged trafficking and forced labor violations, however.

No final ruling on the case has been made during the decade it has been in court, largely because the GEO Group filed motions raising questions about what specific powers federal contractors have. In January, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Menocal v. the GEO Group, based on a petition filed by the GEO Group.

Justices are now weighing the question of whether federal contractors can file an immediate appeal to lawsuits. An immediate appeal challenges a court ruling before the case is concluded, as opposed to most appeals, which occur afterward. In this case, the GEO Group wants to appeal the district court’s decision to deny its immunity. The company has already lost huge sums in lawsuits in other states over the same dollar-a-day work program. (ADD LINK TO OTHER LAWSUITS)

As the case goes through the Supreme Court, here are seven things to know about the GEO Group:

Three years later, the WCC secured its first contract: a deal to design, build and manage an immigrant detention center for Immigration and Naturalization Services in the city of Aurora, Colorado, according to the GEO Group. The facility opened in May 1987.

In 2003, the WCC changed its name to the GEO Group as part of a deal by the Wackenhut Corporation to reacquire a large share of the company.

The GEO Group has been operating in Aurora for nearly fifty years, but the company has made more headlines since Trump returned to office in January. After Trump touted his mass deportation plan, which he dubbed “Operation Aurora” while on the campaign trail in Colorado in October 2024, the GEO Group has been busy investing $70 million to expand the Aurora facility in order to house upwards of 1,400 people at a time instead of the 300 it had usually held. According to Latino advocacy groups, ICE’s raids in Colorado have been the largest in the country.

ICE Relies on the GEO Group to Keep Immigrants Detained

ICE arrests immigrants and deports them, but the GEO Group handles the middle step of keeping them detained while ICE secures a removal order from a judge.

Despite the Aurora facility’s name, only about one or two ICE agents are inside the complex at a time, according to the federal agency. Although ICE denies entry to certain officials and outlines how the GEO Group should treat its detainees, most of the inside operations are handled by the GEO Group.

ICE has detained more than 60,000 people in the U.S. and hopes to increase its detention capacity to 100,000, according to reporting by the Washington Post. For Trump’s mass deportation to work, ICE needs places to put a city’s worth of detained immigrants behind bars while initiating removal proceedings in immigration court, a process that can be stalled at times.

According to reports, the Trump administration plans to open three new ICE detention facilities in the Colorado cities of Hudson, Walsenburg and Ignacio. Members of this state’s congressional delegation have confirmed that the GEO Group will likely reopen the private prison in Hudson, in northeastern Colorado, that held state prisoners from Alaska from 2009 to 2014.

From 1997 to 2010, rival CoreCivic operated the facility that ICE is expected to use in Walsenburg. The two facilities would be about the size of Aurora’s ICE detention center, with between 1,100 to 1,400 beds.

Ignacio is on the Southern Ute Reservation; the tribe released a statement in August that it had no agreement with ICE to allow a new detention facility.

The GEO Group Offers a “Turnkey” Suite of Detention Services

On the GEO Group’s website, the company says it offers “turnkey solutions” for incarceration. Ironically, “turnkey” is a seventeenth-century English term for jailer, but the GEO Group is using it to offer everything needed from the ground up. The company boasts that it doesn’t just provide the detention center guards: The company designs the facility, finances it, builds it, cleans it, transports the inmates, feeds them and sets up any classes or work programs required inside.

The GEO Group also offers services for people who are out of detention but still under supervision, like electronic tracking devices made by BI Incorporated, a Boulder-based company. The GEO Group also operates nonresidential and residential re-entry centers, sometimes called halfway houses, which are supervised housing or work programs for people leaving incarceration.

ICE Contracted with the GEO Group After Its Own Name Change

The GEO Group has been running the Aurora facility since 1987, but the contract moved from the INS to ICE in 2004, less than a year after Congress bumped ICE from being a post-9/11 bureau to a partial replacement for the INS.

The INS had been around since 1933, and references to it often pop up in older TV shows and films, like in 1993’s Coneheads, in which INS agents are the main villains. The INS was the country’s primary immigration enforcement arm for seventy years. Along with the Border Patrol, the INS led some of the largest deportation efforts in the U.S., like Operation Wetback. After 9/11, the U.S. created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and removed the INS, which was a part of the Justice Department, entirely.

The DHS was broadly put in charge of protecting U.S. soil and borders, with agencies like FEMA, the Secret Service and the Coast Guard stuffed into it. The INS’s responsibilities were split among three agencies: Border Patrol (which had been around longer than the INS), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE.

While the Border Patrol is charged with making sure that no one crosses borders illegally and CBP with making sure nothing dangerous gets through legal entryways, ICE handles the immigrants already in the country. ICE was largely seen as the successor to the INS, and the main source of the country’s immigration enforcement agents.

ICE now has a $45 billion annual budget after it was allocated more money in Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which includes funds to build more detention facilities.

The GEO Group Is No Stranger to Lawsuits

For the past few decades, the GEO Group has been a consistent target of lawsuits and has spent millions on settlements.

The federal government sued the company in 2010 over claims that male managers sexually harassed female employees at a prison in Arizona, resulting in a $140,000 settlement by the GEO Group in 2013, and then another $60,000 payment three years later to settle another claim in the same case. Then, the GEO Group paid $550,000 to comply with a consent decree that resulted from more claims involving the same sexual harassment suit, known as EEOC and ACRD v. the GEO Group.

In 2015, the GEO Group paid $50,000 to settle a First Amendment case brought by Prison Legal News, which claimed the company censored its coverage of the New Castle Correctional Facility in Indiana.

In 2017, Iranian immigrant Kamyar Samimi died in the Aurora ICE facility after being cut off from methadone. The ACLU of Colorado sued the GEO Group for wrongful death, resulting in a confidential settlement between the GEO Group and Samimi’s family in 2020.

In 2021, a federal jury ordered the GEO Group to pay $17 million in back wages to detainees at a Tacoma ICE facility for the same dollar-a-day program involved in the Aurora case. An appellate court upheld that ruling in January and increased the payout to $23 million.

In 2022, Nicaraguan immigrant Melvin Ariel Calero Mendoza died in the Aurora ICE facility from a pulmonary embolism. Two years later, his family filed a wrongful death suit, which is still ongoing.

In July, Congressman Jason Crow sued the Trump administration and DHS after being denied entry to the Aurora ICE facility. That lawsuit is ongoing, but the GEO Group isn’t liable in that case.

The GEO Group Operates Prisons in Australia, South Africa

The GEO Group operates three prisons abroad: two in Australia and one in South Africa.

The Fulham and Ravenhall correctional centers in Australia, both in the southeastern state of Victoria, are medium-security male prisons. Ravenhall, located next to Melbourne, can hold about 1,300 people, making it one of the largest correctional centers in that country. Fulham holds about 900 people and is further east, in a more rural area.

In South Africa, the GEO Group co-runs the Kutama Sinthumule Correctional Center, a 3,000-bed maximum-security male prison. In this public-private partnership, the GEO Group helped build and manage the facility, which is publicly owned and located in a rural northeastern part of the country. A riot broke out there in 2023, and a major fire led to a partial shutdown.

The Geo Group’s three international detention facilities handle criminal offenders incarcerated in their own countries. Stateside, most of the detention facilities that the GEO Group manages are for immigrants facing deportation, who haven’t been criminally charged by the U.S. These immigrants might face charges in their own country, but they’re held in facilities like the Aurora detention center for civil immigration violations. Unlike the detention centers in the U.S., none of the international facilities hold women.

Just a few days before Vizguerra’s arrest in mid-March, ICE arrested Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil in New York and then transferred him to a GEO Group detention center in Louisiana. Khalil’s arrest drew international attention because he was a leader in pro-Palestine protests the previous year. Khalil was released by a federal judge’s ruling in June.

Activist Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino was arrested in June; his supporters say he was arrested because he’s a prominent farmworker organizer. Sent to a facility run by the GEO Group, he chose to return to Mexico soon after.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Justice Department has ordered federal prosecutors to provide examples of ""unusual judicial system obstacles"" they have faced during criminal or civil proceedings tied to immigration, assaults on law enforcement or ""antifa,"" according to a government email reviewed by Reuters.

The highly unusual request to collect examples of what the department sees as judicial pushback was sent on Thursday evening by a senior official in Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office to U.S. Attorneys.

It suggests an escalation in a series of confrontations between federal district courts and the Trump administration.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly called judges who have ruled against his administration ""crooked,"" ""conflicted"" and ""rogue."" Many of the judges have been subjected to threats or harassment after issuing rulings against the Trump administration.

A Justice Department spokesperson, when asked on Friday to comment on the email, reiterated criticism of certain judges' actions.

""Across the country, judicial activists - liberals in robes - continue to obstruct lawful efforts to protect the American people, even in cases where the Supreme Court has already made the law unmistakably clear,"" the spokesperson said.

""The department is committed to strengthening our litigation posture at every level so we can better defend public safety initiatives and prevent activist judges from undermining the rule of law.""

In the email, Blanche's office instructed each U.S. attorney's office to provide two to three examples of judges posing challenges to Justice Department efforts to obtain search warrants or signatures on criminal complaints, get approval on jury instructions, or obtain pre-trial detention.

It asked prosecutors to focus on cases related to assaults against federal agents, particularly if they involved immigration enforcement or investigations into anti-fascist movement groups known as ""antifa,"" which the Trump administration has designated as a terrorist organization.

The email did not indicate what the Justice Department intends to do with the information, which prosecutors were asked to submit by midday on Friday.

The email comes shortly after Blanche appeared at an event hosted by the conservative Federalist Society, where he made fiery remarks about federal district court judges.

""They have a robe on but they are more political or certainly as political as the most liberal governor or D.A.,"" Blanche said.

""There's a group of judges that are repeat players, and that's obviously not by happenstance, that's intentional, and it's a war, man.""

A group of 50 retired judges criticized his comments, saying his rhetoric ""poses a grave threat to the rule of law and the judiciary.""

Federal judges across the country have increasingly raised concerns over the legality of Trump administration policies on matters ranging from immigration to the targeting of medical practitioners who provide gender-affirming care to transgender youth.

Chief U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg earlier this year concluded the Trump administration appeared to have acted in bad faith when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights on March 15 at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess the legality of the action.

Boasberg found probable cause to hold the government in criminal contempt and launched an investigation to determine who was responsible, but a federal appeals court later tossed out his ruling in a 2-1 decision.

The case will now proceed, with the tribunal retaining authority to manage how any national security issues are addressed.","Pitasanna Shanmugathas is a third-year student at the University of Windsor Faculty of Law. He has been actively following developments in this discrimination case before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.

A Canadian Human Rights Tribunal member ruled last week that the government cannot invoke national security laws to indefinitely delay discrimination complaints. The Tribunal decision comes as a victory for a former refugee who says Canada’s Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) exploited and discriminated against him for more than two decades.

Kagusthan Ariaratnam—a Tamil former refugee from Sri Lanka who was forced to join a militant group as a child soldier—alleges that CSIS coerced him to work for nine years as an unpaid informant. He also contends that the agency shared his private mental health records with prospective employers, sabotaging his efforts to secure work elsewhere.

Ariaratnam says CSIS refused to hire him despite his qualifications and experience, even as the agency continued to benefit from intelligence tips he provided about Tamil militant organizations. He also asserts that the agency discriminated against him based on his race, ethnicity, religious identity as a Muslim, and mental health conditions—including depression, and what he describes as false diagnoses of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, which he argues resulted from CSIS inaccurately telling police and doctors that he was delusional when he was, in fact, following their instructions.

After filing a complaint in January 2018, Ariaratnam says it took more than six years for the complaint to reach the tribunal, and he was unable to submit detailed allegations until February 2025. At that time, CSIS asked the Canadian government to invoke the national security doctrine, which would transfer the case to a different oversight body: the National Security and Intelligence Review Agency (NSIRA).

Both CSIS and the Canadian Human Rights Commission argued that this move would pause the tribunal proceedings indefinitely, allowing NSIRA to complete its review, after which the commission would decide whether to return the case to the tribunal—a process with no clear timeline.

Tribunal Member Ashley Bressette-Martinez rejected the argument advanced by CSIS and the Human Rights Commission, finding the law is silent on whether tribunal proceedings should be paused when agencies invoke national security laws. Reasoning that such power conflicts with the tribunal’s independence from the commission, she determined that once a case reaches the tribunal, it belongs to the complainant—not the government agencies involved.

“The power to withdraw a complaint before the Tribunal belongs to a complainant and no other party has that power,” Bressette-Martinez wrote.

Ariaratnam’s lawyer, Nicholas Pope, told JURIST in an exclusive interview that Bressette-Martinez’s decision blocks a delay tactic commonly used by agencies. “It’s quite common for federal agencies to invoke national security in human rights cases involving CSIS or immigration matters with individuals from areas of the world that the government stereotypes as being affiliated with terrorism,” Pope explained. “This decision limits the use of NSIRA as a tool to delay human rights proceedings.”

Ariaratnam told JURIST his seven-year legal battle has devastated him financially and emotionally. “I have spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees. There were moments I felt completely alone and defeated, especially when the process dragged on for years without progress,” he said. “But I kept going because I knew what happened to me was wrong.”

The allegations at issue date back to events that began in 2000. At that time, Ariaratnam says a CSIS agent threatened to report him to immigration authorities if he refused to become an informant. The agent allegedly promised to hire him once he became a permanent resident in 2002. Despite this promise, CSIS never hired him, even after he repeatedly applied for about 22 years, according to his complaint.

In 2016, Ariaratnam had applied for a security guard position on Parliament Hill. He explained that CSIS shared his confidential mental health information with House of Commons officials, who then cancelled his security clearance application. A 2020 NSIRA report confirms that CSIS representatives met with House officials and shared with them Ariaratnam’s mental health records.

“My medical history had nothing to do with my ability to perform the job,” Ariaratnam stated. “It was shared without my consent and used to deny me a security clearance—effectively branding me as ‘unfit’ because of my mental health status.”

In his complaint, Ariaratnam seeks $3.8 million in damages. Pope says the complaint’s central claim is straightforward: “His CSIS handler promised him that he would be hired once he obtained his permanent residency, and she said he had the suitable skills. Then he was not hired despite applying multiple times.”

The tribunal noted that pausing the proceedings could be illogical if it ultimately resolved the pending dispute over which allegations should be included in the case—an outcome that could eliminate the national security concerns entirely.

The case will now proceed, with the tribunal retaining authority to manage how any national security issues are addressed.

The federal government has not publicly announced the move. But Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden said he was informed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection could start an enforcement operation Saturday or soon after the weekend.

It would be another step in the Trump administration's strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of some of America's largest cities run by Democrats. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who don't have legal status in the U.S., and sparked a number of lawsuits challenging the tactics.

Here’s what to know:

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina's two U.S. senators are Republican and President Donald Trump won the state all three times that he's run for office.

Crime was down this year, through August, compared to the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has used the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutskaha on a Charlotte light-rail train as evidence that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with murder.

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

Critics have described the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They’re also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We’ve seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully"" and ""reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in operations by Customs and Border Protection.

There is no sign that the National Guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina's congressional delegation have urged Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to make that request.

The governor's office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe.

The Trump administration has deployed the Guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. A judge so far has stopped the Guard from working in the Chicago area.

Between 40% and 42% of Americans say ICE often uses unnecessary physical force against citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants.","The Trump administration has significantly increased funding and hiring for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). On its website, the agency has touted ""record-breaking immigration enforcement in the US interior"" since the start of the Trump administration. However, this increase in activity has coincided with many of ICE's actions being deemed unlawful by judges. Most notably, ICE deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador — a country he had fled due to gang violence — as a result of an ""administrative error."" YouGov polling in April found that a majority of Americans thought Abrego Garcia should be returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. ICE's tactics have met with resistance, sparking protests across the country. What do Americans think about ICE's actions across the country?

Last month, YouGov polling found that a majority of Americans disapprove of how ICE is handling its job. About half of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful and are concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. One half or more of Americans think that ICE wrongfully arrests, deports, and uses unnecessary force against both U.S. citizens and immigrants. Americans are more likely to approve than to disapprove of protests against ICE.

A majority of Americans disapprove of ICE

A majority (53%) of Americans somewhat or strongly disapprove of how ICE is handling its job. Only 39% approve. Both Democrats and Independents are much more likely to disapprove than to approve of ICE (85% vs. 12% among Democrats and 62% vs. 25% among Independents). In contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly approve of the agency's job handling: 79% approve and 13% disapprove.

The high rate of disapproval of ICE may stem in part from concerns about the agency's tactics. Half (52%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. Only 26% say that its tactics are about right and 11% say that they are not forceful enough.

Majorities of both Democrats (86%) and Independents (60%) say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. But only 12% of Republicans think ICE is too forceful; 52% say ICE's tactics are about right. Those who think ICE's tactics are not forceful enough are in the minority in all three groups: 1% of Democrats, 8% of Independents, and 24% of Republicans.

Americans are not simply concerned about ICE's tactics in the abstract: Nearly half (46%) of Americans are somewhat or very concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. That's roughly the same as the share who are not very or not at all concerned (47%).

Three-quarters (75%) of Democrats are concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. Half (50%) of Independents are concerned as well, more than the 39% who are not very or not at all concerned. Only 16% of Republicans are concerned ICE could mistreat someone they know; most (78%) are not very or not at all concerned.

Most Hispanic (72%) and Black (65%) Americans are concerned that someone they know could be mistreated by ICE. Concern among white Americans is less widespread (38%, vs. 57% who are not very or not at all concerned).

About half of Americans support protests against ICE

Americans are more likely to somewhat or strongly approve than disapprove of protests against ICE actions (48% vs. 39%). Majorities of Democrats (76%) and Independents (55%) approve of protests against ICE actions, with small shares disapproving (12% of Democrats and 28% of Independents). Most Republicans disapprove of anti-ICE protests (76%, compared to 13% who approve).

Majorities think that ICE mistreats citizens and immigrants

Majorities of Americans say that ICE sometimes or often arrests U.S. citizens (55%) and immigrants who are authorized to live in the U.S. (61%) who have not committed any immigration or customs violations. Far smaller shares of Americans think that ICE rarely or never wrongfully arrests U.S. citizens (31%) and authorized immigrants (29%).

Large majorities of Democrats think ICE sometimes or often wrongfully arrests U.S. citizens (84%) and authorized immigrants (86%). Majorities of Independents say the same (58% about citizens and 68% about immigrants) but only small shares of Republicans do (24% and 29%). Majorities of Republicans think ICE rarely or never wrongfully arrests U.S. citizens (61%) or authorized immigrants (60%).

Americans are only slightly less likely to say ICE wrongfully deports people. About half (51%) of Americans say ICE sometimes or often deports U.S. citizens who have not committed any immigration or customs violations, and a majority (56%) say the same about authorized immigrants.

Large majorities of Democrats say that ICE sometimes or often wrongfully deports U.S. citizens (78%) and authorized immigrants (87%). Majorities of Independents also say U.S. citizens (53%) and authorized immigrants (61%) are sometimes or often wrongfully deported but only small shares of Republicans do (23% and 22%). About two-thirds of Republicans say that U.S. citizens (64%) are rarely or never wrongfully deported and a similar proportion (67%) say the same about authorized immigrants.

Majorities of Americans say that ICE sometimes or often uses unnecessary physical force in its interactions with U.S. citizens (59%), authorized immigrants (60%), and immigrants who are not authorized to live in the U.S. (64%). For each of these three groups, less than one-third of Americans say ICE rarely or never uses unnecessary force (30% against citizens, 29% against authorized immigrants, and 27% against unauthorized immigrants).

Most Democrats and Independents think that ICE uses unnecessary physical force. For each of the three groups — citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants — about 90% of Democrats, about two-thirds of Independents, and between about one-quarter and one-third of Republicans say ICE uses unnecessary force. Republicans are more likely to say that ICE rarely or never uses unnecessary force: 62% say unnecessary force is rarely used against citizens, 60% against authorized immigrants, and 56% against unauthorized immigrants.

About the same shares of Americans think ICE uses unnecessary physical force against U.S. citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants at various frequencies. Americans are slightly more likely to say ICE uses unnecessary force against unauthorized immigrants and a bit less likely to say it uses unnecessary force against citizens. However, these differences are very small, rendering them statistically insignificant.

Between 40% and 42% of Americans say ICE often uses unnecessary physical force against citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants. This narrow range (2 percentage points) is within the survey's margin of error. There are similarly narrow ranges in the shares saying ICE sometimes (19% to 22%), rarely (17% to 19%) and never (10% to 11%) uses unnecessary force against each of the three groups.

Americans are less likely to approve of ICE after being asked about ICE's treatment of U.S. citizens

To avoid biasing respondents, we randomized the order in which panelists were asked questions about the treatment of different groups. Some panelists were randomly assigned to first answer questions about ICE's treatment of U.S. citizens, then about their general evaluations of ICE, then about authorized immigrants. Others were first asked about ICE's treatment of authorized immigrants, then their evaluations of ICE, then about U.S. citizens. (All panelists were asked the single question about the treatment of unauthorized immigrants last.)

This methodology was intended to reduce any bias that may come from having just been prompted to think about either citizens or immigrants. It also served as an experiment that allows us to understand how being asked first about ICE's treatment of citizens or of immigrants affects overall evaluations of ICE.

We find that being shown questions about ICE's treatment of citizens makes Americans more likely to disapprove of the agency, compared to questions about treatment of authorized immigrants. Americans who were asked about their evaluation of ICE after questions about ICE's treatment of U.S. citizens were 7 percentage points more likely to disapprove of ICE than those who had just seen questions about ICE's treatment of authorized immigrants (56% vs. 49%) and 5 percentage points less likely to approve (36% vs. 41%). This effect goes in the same direction among Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. In all three groups, respondents who were first asked about ICE's treatment of citizens were between 5 and 7 percentage points more likely to disapprove of ICE than those who were first asked about authorized immigrants.

Americans are more likely to disapprove than to approve of ICE regardless of whether its treatment of citizens or immigrants is fresh in their minds. However, seeing questions about ICE's treatment of citizens significantly worsens evaluations of the agency. Note that, unlike in some experiments, this survey did not introduce any new information to respondents. We only asked them to share their own opinions in a different order. This suggests that high-profile instances of ICE detaining, arresting, injuring, or shooting U.S. citizens could be particularly damaging to the agency's reputation, as making ICE's treatment of citizens more salient to Americans appears to make them more likely to disapprove of ICE.

I don’t combine them.” Her husband, Strategy Group CEO Ben Yoho, didn’t respond to questions.
This is not the first time that the Strategy Group has gotten public money through a Noem contract.
The DHS ad that the company filmed at Mount Rushmore has aired during “Fox & Friends” in recent days.
The contracts total $220 million so far, leading the DHS ad budget to triple in the most recent fiscal year, according to Bloomberg.","This story was originally published by ProPublica.

On Oct. 2, the second day of the government shutdown, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem arrived at Mount Rushmore to shoot a television ad. Sitting on horseback in chaps and a cowboy hat, Noem addressed the camera with a stern message for immigrants: “Break our laws, we’ll punish you.”

Noem has hailed the more than $200 million, taxpayer-funded ad campaign as a crucial tool to stem illegal immigration. Her agency invoked the “national emergency” at the border as it awarded contracts for the campaign, bypassing the normal competitive bidding process designed to prevent waste and corruption.

The Department of Homeland Security has kept at least one beneficiary of the nine-figure ad deal a secret, records and interviews show: a Republican consulting firm with long-standing personal and business ties to Noem and her senior aides at DHS. The company running the Mount Rushmore shoot, called the Strategy Group, does not appear on public documents about the contract. The main recipient listed on the contracts is a mysterious Delaware company, which was created days before the deal was finalized.

Noem’s uses of credit cards and an economic fund cause lawmakers to propose restrictions

No firm has closer ties to Noem’s political operation than the Strategy Group. It played a central role in her 2022 South Dakota gubernatorial campaign. Corey Lewandowski, her top adviser at DHS, has worked extensively with the firm. And the company’s CEO is married to Noem’s chief spokesperson at DHS, Tricia McLaughlin.

The Strategy Group’s ad work is the first known example of money flowing from Noem’s agency to businesses controlled by her allies and friends.

Government contracting experts said the depth of the ties between DHS leadership and the Strategy Group suggested major potential violations of ethics rules.

“It’s corrupt, is the word,” said Charles Tiefer, a leading authority on federal contract law and former member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. He said that the Strategy Group’s role should prompt investigations by both the DHS inspector general and the House Oversight Committee.

“Hiding your friends as subcontractors is like playing hide the salami with the taxpayer,” Tiefer added.

Federal regulations forbid conflicts of interest in contracting and require that the process be conducted “with complete impartiality and with preferential treatment for none.”

“It’s worthy of an investigation to ferret out how these decisions were made, and whether they were made legally and without bias,” said Scott Amey, a contracting expert and general counsel at the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight.

The revelations come as the amount of money at Noem’s disposal has skyrocketed. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill granted DHS more than $150 billion, and Noem has given herself an unusual degree of control over how that money is spent. This summer, she began requiring that she personally approve any payment over $100,000.

Asked about the Strategy Group’s work for DHS, McLaughlin, the agency spokesperson, said in an interview, “We don’t have visibility into why they were chosen.”

“I don’t know who they’re a subcontractor with, but I don’t work with them because I have a conflict of interest and I fully recused myself,” she said. “My marriage is one thing and work is another. I don’t combine them.” Her husband, Strategy Group CEO Ben Yoho, didn’t respond to questions.

In a written statement, DHS said, “DHS has no involvement with the selection of subcontractors.” They added that the Strategy Group does not have a direct contract with the agency, saying “DHS cannot and does not determine, control, or weigh in on who contractors hire.”

Contracting experts said that agencies can and do sometimes require that subcontractors be approved by officials. It’s not clear how much the Strategy Group has been paid.

This is not the first time that the Strategy Group has gotten public money through a Noem contract. As governor of South Dakota in 2023, her administration set off a scandal by hiring the Ohio-based company to do a different ad campaign, paying it $8.5 million in state funds. While the state said the contract was done by the book, a former Noem administration official told ProPublica that Noem quietly intervened to ensure the Strategy Group got the deal. ProPublica granted some people anonymity to discuss the deals because of their sensitivity.

The firm also paid up to $25,000 to one of Noem’s closest advisers in South Dakota, previously unreported records show. (The adviser, 28-year-old Madison Sheahan, now serves at DHS as the second-in-command of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Sheahan didn’t respond to questions about why she was paid.)

The DHS ad that the company filmed at Mount Rushmore has aired during “Fox & Friends” in recent days. Executives from the Strategy Group traveled to the shoot and hired subcontractors to fill out the film crew, according to records and a person involved in the campaign. The ad’s aesthetic sits somewhere between a political campaign ad and a Jeep commercial as Noem tells would-be immigrants to “come here the right way.”

“From the cowboys who tamed the West to the titans who built our cities,” Noem says, as images of Trump Tower in Chicago and Trump raising his fist after the assassination attempt last year flash on the screen, “America has always rewarded vision and grit.” Noem continues: “You cross the border illegally, we’ll find you.”

The ad is the latest in a campaign that Noem debuted in February, just a few weeks after she took charge of DHS. “Any delay in providing these critical communications to the public will increase the spread of misinformation, especially misinformation by smugglers,” the agency wrote, explaining why it was skipping the competitive bidding process normally required for government contracts. The initial ads featured Noem thanking Trump for securing the border.

The contracts total $220 million so far, leading the DHS ad budget to triple in the most recent fiscal year, according to Bloomberg. The lion’s share of ad contracts is typically used to buy TV airtime or spots on social media. Advertising firms make money by taking an often-hefty commission. Federal records show the contracts have gone to two firms. One is a Republican ad company in Louisiana called People Who Think, which has been awarded $77 million.

But the majority of the money — $143 million — has gone to a mysterious LLC in Delaware. The company was created just days before it was awarded the deal.

Little is known about the Delaware company, which is called Safe America Media and lists its address as the Virginia home of a veteran Republican operative, Michael McElwain. McElwain has long had his own advertising company (separate from the Delaware one), but there’s little evidence that firm could handle a nine-figure federal contract on its own: It reported just five employees when it received COVID-19 relief money a few years ago.

How, where and to whom Safe America Media doled out the $143 million is unknown. Any subcontractors hired to do work on the DHS ads are not disclosed in federal contracting databases.

The office funding the ad contracts is listed as the DHS Office of Public Affairs, which is run by McLaughlin, contract records show. McLaughlin married Yoho, the Strategy Group CEO, earlier this year.

In its statement, DHS said the agency does its contracting “by the book” and the process is run by career officials. “It is very sad that Pro Publica would seek to defame these public servants,” DHS added.

Asked about why the agency chose Safe America Media, DHS said, “The results speak for themselves: the most secure border in American history and over 2 million illegal aliens exiting the United States.” McElwain and People Who Think didn’t respond to questions.

Yoho was still in college when he first served as campaign manager for a U.S. congressman. Now, at 38 years old, he’s a national player in the cutthroat industry of political advertising. Federal election records show tens of millions in payments to his firm during the 2024 election cycle, coming from dozens of Republican congressional candidates. And Noem has proved a particularly lucrative client.

Lewandowski brought Yoho into Noem’s inner circle back in South Dakota, according to two people familiar with the matter, putting the young consultant in charge of the ad side of her 2022 gubernatorial reelection campaign. Noem had a more than $5 million advertising budget for the race, records show. After she won in a landslide, Yoho, who has called Noem a friend, came to South Dakota to attend her inauguration ceremony. He sat off to the side of the stage, next to Lewandowski. (Lewandowski didn’t respond to a request for comment.)

By then, Yoho’s next big project with Noem was already in the works. In late 2022, Noem was quietly preparing to launch another sprawling ad campaign — only this time, the money would come from state coffers. The stated goal was to encourage workers to move to South Dakota. The upcoming contract opportunity wasn’t public yet, but Yoho was already involved in planning the campaign, according to records first reported by Sioux Falls Live.

Then on Jan. 12, 2023, Yoho’s company registered to do business in South Dakota under the name Go West Media. The next day, the contract opportunity went live.

Seven companies submitted proposals for the project. Then the pressure from above set in, according to a former Noem administration official involved in the process.

The former official said a top Noem aide told them the governor would be angry if Yoho’s company didn’t win the contract. “He was very direct: ‘She wants to do it,’” they said. Contemporaneous text messages reviewed by ProPublica corroborate that senior Noem administration officials pushed for Yoho to get the contract. Eventually, he did. (In its statement, DHS denied that Noem influenced the process.)

Noem starred in Yoho’s ads herself, dressing up as a dentist, a plumber and a state trooper as she touted her state’s growing economy. Exactly how much Yoho and the Strategy Group made off the $8.5 million deal is unclear. Some of the money was used to purchase spots on Fox News, including one during a Republican presidential debate. Some of the money appears to have gone back to South Dakota — into the bank account of another of Noem’s top advisers.

Sheahan, now the second-in-command at ICE, was paid up to $25,000 by Go West in 2023 for “consulting,” according to a financial disclosure document Sheahan later filed. At the time, Sheahan was serving as both the operations director for Noem as governor and the political director for Noem’s campaign work, according to a copy of her 2023 resume obtained by ProPublica. Her responsibilities included coordinating “daily logistics and operations” for Noem and her team, the resume said. She also managed the “relationship with high level donors” to American Resolve, Noem’s network of outside political groups.

As his firm received millions from the South Dakota state government, Yoho separately continued to work for Noem in other capacities. He worked under Lewandowski on the publicity campaign for Noem’s 2024 memoir, according to a person familiar with the matter. (The book became famous for including an anecdote about Noem shooting her dog.)

The Strategy Group also received a stream of payments for social media consulting and media production work over the last few years from Noem’s American Resolve PAC. Federal election records show the PAC made its last payment to Yoho’s company this February, a couple weeks after Noem took her post as the head of DHS.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/08-Noem-MN-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-11-15 11:00:02.669059

Arizona state representative Raquel Terán told Fox 10 Phoenix that Jose Barco, a Venezuelan-born veteran whose family fled Cuba as refugees, was deported at 4am from Arizona.

Anna Stout, a volunteer on Barco’s defense team, told Denver 7 his team was not notified of plans for his deportation.

Barco’s family has still not received confirmation of Jose’s current location as of Friday evening. “We have not received word from Jose or from anyone else with firsthand knowledge that he has actually arrived in Nogales. We only have the official statement from ICE to go on, but no confirmation of Jose’s current location,” his family said in a statement.

“Jose was not able to reach out to his family before any of this initiated,” she told the news outlet, adding that the process has been “frustrating”.

Immigration enforcement told Fox 10 that Barco was deported to Nogales in Mexico.

The court previously ordered for his removal to either Venezuela, Cuba or Mexico.

Barco’s father was a political dissident in Cuba who spoke out against communism, forcing his family to flee to Venezuela in the 1980s. Four years after Barco was born, his family entered the US with asylum, and were later given lawful permanent resident status.

Barco enlisted in the army at 17 and served two tours in Iraq. Barco was injured by an improvised explosive device during one of his deployments, and received a Purple Heart for his service in combat. He was also awarded a Combat Infantry Badge.

During his military career, Barco had filled out paperwork for citizenship, but his application was never processed for an unknown reason, despite his submitting it. His legal team says his former commander attests to helping him complete and submit the application.

Barco, 39, served 15 years in prison for a felony conviction of attempted murder. In October 2009, Barco was sentenced to 52 years after being convicted of firing a gun at a house party in Colorado Springs. He was suffering from PTSD. One of the bullets he fired hit a 19-year-old woman in the leg.

Barco was released on parole this January after serving 15 years due to good behavior. Upon release, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement detained Barco and took him to a detention center in Colorado.

In September, an immigration judge denied Barco’s relief appeals, which included an application for asylum, and ordered for the veteran’s removal from the US without specifying a date.

Stout said the last few hours have been brutal for Barco’s family and loved ones.

“The fact he is being removed from the country where he was raised and that he fought and bled for is devastating to begin with, but the uncertainty of where he is, not knowing which country they would be deporting him to, and being denied access to him – including for his legal team – has made a horrific situation so much worse.

Most families know at a minimum where their loved ones will be deported to when they are facing a removal order, but Jose’s family has been kept in the dark about his whereabouts and his destination at every stage of this process.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9119796a646acc4802935fec5fc3c244a9fdff2/456_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34699fb0f80b9f6c3dce081872f2f9fe",N,,2025-11-14 23:56:42.095856

A leading immigration expert in Washington has termed Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's proposed bill to end H-1B visas as “one of the most efficient ways to hurt Americans,” and would lead to more ""preventable deaths.""

In an interview with IANS, Sarah Pierce, the Director of Social Policy at Third Way, a think tank, argued that Greene's attempt to target the visa programme would “gut access to care overnight.”

“Slashing the flow of foreign workers, including the medical professionals her own communities rely on, would gut access to care overnight.”

On Friday, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X, reiterating her plans to introduce a bill to “ban H1B visas in all sectors” except the medical profession.

In a video post on Thursday, Greene announced her bill proposals - allowing only 10,000 visas annually, down from the current 85,000 cap.

She said even that carve-out could be phased out over the next decade. Her bill would also take away from the citizenship path, forcing visa holders to return home.

Pierce stressed that her exemption proposal of 10,000 visas for medical professionals would still lead to more “preventable deaths.”

“The H-1B programme currently brings in far more medical professionals than her arbitrary 10,000-visa cap allows. This bill would leave US families, especially in rural areas, with fewer doctors, longer wait times, and more preventable deaths. It's cruelty disguised as policy,” she added.

Pierce acknowledged that there are some US workers in tech sectors who have lost jobs due to the H-1B visas, but gutting the entire programme is “both dishonest and dangerous.”

“Eliminating it or drowning it in punitive fees would kneecap the American economy and jeopardise the sectors we rely on most.”

Leading Republican and conservative leaders have demanded the gutting of the H-1B visas after US President Donald Trump defended the foreign worker visa programme.

In an interview with Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday, Trump was asked if his administration planned to deprioritise H-1B visas. He replied, “You do have to bring in talent.”

When Ingraham countered, “We have plenty of talent,” Trump responded, “No you don't.”

“You don't have certain talents….And people have to learn, you can't take people off an unemployment line and say, I'm going to put you into a factory. We're going to make missiles,” he added.

Laura Ingraham, posted on X on Friday, responding to a CNN debate over the issue.

“America's survival depends on its importing an endless stream of foreign workers—supposedly all geniuses?” she asked.

The White House clarified on Wednesday that it's committed to cracking down on alleged abuses in the visa system, not scrapping the entire programme.

Trump signed a proclamation in September by announcing a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications.

Last week, the US Department of Labor (DOL) also launched at least 175 investigations into potential abuses within the H-1B visa programme.

Pierce emphasised that instead of “scapegoating” the programme, US Congress should take the lead in reforming it.

“Congress should do the hard work: reform the programme so it actually delivers for American workers and families. Because the truth is simple—we need more doctors, more home-care workers, and, yes, more high-skilled tech talent if we want this country to function,"" she said.

The administration's H-1B visa policy has already faced legal challenges with two major lawsuits filed in courts, including the one by the US Chamber of Commerce, the country's biggest business organisation.

Pierce said she would be “very surprised” if those cases are not successful, but highlighted the plight of applicants who are currently facing visa hurdles.

“I will be very surprised if the legal challenges aren't successful. Unfortunately, even if they are, that doesn't help applicants who are currently applying and being forced to pay the absurdly high fee,” she noted.

While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology.
In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll body cameras out to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers.
In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say.
She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training.","Immigration Customs and Enforcement has yet to purchase new translation technology it promised nearly four months ago would replace a Spanish language course requirement for officers as part of an effort to speed up the agency’s hiring process, according to two Homeland Security Department officials.

In August, ICE officials told reporters that the agency had purchased new “robust translation services” for officers to use in the field while pursuing immigration arrests as part of President Donald Trump’s deportations policy. Caleb Vitello, who was the head of training for new ICE recruits at the time, described the new technology as “so much more efficient” than the five-week-long Spanish course.

ICE had considered providing officers with body-worn translation services, powered by AI, that can be used on body cameras but has not purchased any, the two DHS official said.

The lack of Spanish classes or the body-worn translation devices for new ICE officers as they carry out arrests has sparked concern about potential communication misunderstandings that could endanger the agents and people in the communities they are targeting, the officials said.

The Trump administration has sought to speed up ICE’s hiring process to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 new officers by the end of the year.

An ICE spokesperson said in a statement that ICE has replaced the five-week Spanish course that was until July required for new officers with “a more robust translation service,” but declined to say what type of translation services the agency provides.

The agency has relied on a translation service hotline that officers can call when processing immigrants in an office setting, which it continues to use, the DHS officials said.

“Language classes, which previously covered only a specific dialect of Spanish, have been replaced with robust translation and interpretation services that apply to multiple languages,” an ICE spokesperson said in a statement. “ICE frequently encounters native speakers of a diverse range of languages, so modern technology-based solutions are more efficient resources in the field.”

The U.S. Border Patrol still mandates Spanish training for new agents, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

The body-worn translation technology combines body cameras many officers already wear on their vests with AI-translation tools and can detect up to 50 languages. To use it, an officer pushes a button on the body camera and directs it to translate whatever language is being spoken. An AI-generated voice then repeats the words in English.

While ICE so far has not provided new agents the devices, more than 200 police departments across the country are embracing the new technology.

The police department in Joliet, Ill, a city of 150,000 located about an hour outside of Chicago, in June began using the devices, which are developed by Axon Enterprise.

Officials at the department told NBC News that its officers have used the device in more than 1,800 encounters involving 23 different languages.

Officer Charles Moore said having them has helped build the community’s trust in local law enforcement.

“Seeing people when they know that they’re understood, you see their faces light up,” Moore said in an interview with NBC News.

Multiple confrontations involving federal agents and migrants in major U.S. cities have turned violent in recent months, though it’s unclear whether language problems may have contributed to them.

In one of the latest cases to garner attention, a Mexican man and a deputy marshal were shot after a federal agent opened fire while attempting to arrest the man in downtown Los Angeles earlier this week, prosecutors said. Both are expected to recover.

Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff under the Biden administration, said a lack of basic Spanish language skills for agents risks increasing the chances for dangerous encounters.

“That puts both the migrant at risk and potentially law enforcement as you’re taking away the capability for them to openly communicate with those that they interact with,” Houser said.

With 65 million Latinos in the U.S., it’s increasingly common for police departments to mandate Spanish language training. Most police departments in large cities require it. And in the Texas it’s mandatory for all police officers.

In March 2025, under the Biden administration, ICE announced a pilot program to roll body cameras out to 1,600 out of 6,500 ICE officers. The Trump administration has made no publicized efforts to spread beyond that initial 1,600.

In addition to helping to safeguard law enforcement officers, language translation could reduce confusion for members of the public, immigration advocates and attorneys say.

In August, Raquel Sanchez and her husband were driving to work in Washington, D.C., when they say they were stopped by seven unmarked ICE vehicles. An agent at her car door yelled, “What’s your status in the United States?”

In the recording of the encounter, she and her husband struggled to respond because they don’t speak English, and the agents didn’t know Spanish. “I would ask them if we could talk in Spanish, but they kept talking in English,” she said in a phone interview with NBC News.

Sanchez said she and her husband were handcuffed and driven an hour away to an ICE processing facility. She said she told the officers they had teenage boys at home, and her lawyer successfully pushed for her to be released with an ankle monitor. Her husband was moved to an ICE detention center a few hours away, according to Sanchez and her lawyer.

In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said, “ICE makes arrests based on probable cause, and if officers know you are the target, they will make the arrest. If the subject is unknown, there are a number of ways to establish reasonable suspicion and probable cause.”

“Additionally, ICE makes custody determination after arrest, which may include referring an illegal alien to ATD, depending on specific circumstances, such as medical needs,” the ICE spokesperson said, referring to alternatives to detention such as an ankle monitor.

The police department in Corpus Christi, Tex., where fewer than half of its 260 officers are native Spanish speakers, uses the Axon AI-generated translation devices. Lt. Jose Gonzalez, who oversees professional standards for the department, said as a native Spanish speaker he was skeptical of the new technology. But after seeing how it’s helped officers in the field over the past few months, he’s now a believer.

“It’s very important because if you can’t communicate with someone during a traffic stop, you can’t figure out if there are weapons in the car,” Gonzalez said. Even so, Gonzalez noted that no technology is foolproof. “What if your camera malfunctions?” he said. “You have to have a foundation to still communicate.”

Cristina Lozano Argüelles, an assistant professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, agrees. She called the new AI translation technology “exciting” but does not think it should replace Spanish training.

“Spanish language training for law enforcement isn’t just about learning vocabulary—it’s about building trust,” Argüelles said. “When officers can communicate directly with Spanish-speaking residents, interactions can be calmer, more respectful, and more effective.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-ice-training-gk-a21989.jpg",N,,2025-11-14 23:56:49.656175

The ruling last week from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment.

In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to ""great deference"" in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.

Hyundai and Kia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Plaintiff attorney Brian Olney said, “This case is about the dirty secret behind the clean electric vehicles Hyundai is selling to government agencies.
Just work and get it out the door.” Another former Hyundai employee, Rosalinda Soriano-Torres, said the job she was recruited for soon turned into manual labor.
... How can our public agencies purchase vehicles from a company whose supply-chain practices would be illegal here?","A nonprofit organization on Friday sued Orange County-based carmakers Hyundai and Kia, alleging the companies have been violating state law against unfair competition with the use of exploited labor from children, immigrants and inmates.

Jobs to Move America filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court accusing Fountain Valley-based Hyundai and Irvine-based Kia of using cheap labor in supply chains, then masking the practice to obtain contracts from public agencies in California.

State Sen. Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles) and Los Angeles City Councilmember Hugo Soto-Martinez warned Friday at a news conference with plaintiffs that the companies’ contracts could face trouble with public agencies if the allegations are proven.

Hyundai and Kia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Meredith Stewart, a litigation director with Alabama-based Jobs to Move America, said the automakers have “engaged in severe labor exploitation, including coerced prison labor, child labor and migrant labor with working conditions that led to higher safety issues and death.”

Stewart said the companies have used labor from prisons in Alabama and Georgia, which she argued “likely violates the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.”

She further alleged some of the employees are “as young as 13,” claiming both companies “maintain close control over their suppliers and do have the power to influence their employment practices.”

The lawsuit seeks a court order preventing the auto manufacturers from receiving certifications their vehicles are made with high-road employment standards until they submit to an independent audit of their supply chain in Alabama and Georgia, according to Stewart.

Plaintiff attorney Brian Olney said, “This case is about the dirty secret behind the clean electric vehicles Hyundai is selling to government agencies. ... Hyundai uses children to build its vehicles, who aren’t even old enough to drive a car themselves ... Hyundai relies on prison labor, forced labor and even human trafficking.”

Former Hyundai employee Mark Miller said at the news conference he helped make parts for the car company in Montgomery, Ala., and alleged, “There was nothing safe. There was no training. It was ‘get on the line, get the parts and get them out the door no matter what.’”

Whether an employee was sick or injured didn’t matter, Miller said, adding, “I got hurt a couple of times. They’ve got something going with the state. I don’t know what it is, but nobody was ever treated right. Mostly the inmates.

“I mean, there was 33 of us. I worked at the plant for 14 months.... There was no training, no nothing. They told us [to] get on the line, figure it out and get them consoles out the door. It was one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had in my life. There is no safety at Hyundai, there’s no training. There’s no nothing. Just work and get it out the door.”

Another former Hyundai employee, Rosalinda Soriano-Torres, said the job she was recruited for soon turned into manual labor.

“The work was exhausting and the personal protective equipment was minimal ... and the working conditions were dangerous,” she said, adding that immigrants were paid less than U.S. citizens for the same job. “I wanted to quit, but if I lost my job I’d lose my visa.”

When Soriano-Torres got pregnant and asked for a less risky job she was fired, she alleged.

“If these allegations are true we have a serious problem,” Durazo said. “I have questions that need answers. ... How can our public agencies purchase vehicles from a company whose supply-chain practices would be illegal here? And what message does it send if we continue business as usual? The state of California needs to investigate.”

CHICAGO — Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino is no longer in Chicago, according to reports.

Bovino, a controversial leader of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement surge in Chicago, left the city Thursday for Charlotte, North Carolina, CBS News reported Friday, citing unnamed sources.

Appearing on Fox News midday Thursday, Bovino said he was in West Virginia, training with hundreds of Border Patrol agents in preparation for a possible return to Chicago and other cities.

“And you’re going to see us redeploy — it could be New York, it could be Chicago, it could be in Charlotte — but one thing that’s gonna happen is, Gov. Pritzker is gonna see a lot more immigration enforcement. … You can guarantee it,” Bovino said.

Questions Block Club sent Friday to Department of Homeland Security officials about the decision to relocate Bovino — including who would replace him, if social media influencers embedded with his team would be traveling with him and whether lawsuits filed in federal court over federal immigration agents’ use of force impacted the decision — went unanswered.

“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, said in an email.

McLaughlin denied in a social media post Tuesday that Bovino was leaving Chicago in response to reports earlier this week about the Border Patrol chief’s possible exit.

But officials from Mecklenburg County in North Carolina confirmed they’ve been informed that Border Patrol personnel are arriving in the Charlotte area, according to a news release.

Citing a Homeland Security official, the Sun-Times previously reported 1,000 federal agents could return to Chicago in March. About 200 Border Patrol agents had been conducting operations in the Chicago area recently, a top federal immigration enforcement official previously said.

Bovino announced the launch of Operation At Large in September, a week after the start of Operation Midway Blitz, a separate immigration enforcement effort led by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Both are presumably focused on arresting undocumented immigrants with serious criminal histories.

But in the months since, federal agents have shot at least two people, killing one; repeatedly tear-gassed protesters and first responders; shot rubber bullets at protesters; detained U.S. citizens, including children; handcuffed a Chicago alderperson in a hospital; smoke bombed and tear-gassed a Chicago street; fired a chemical weapon at a TV reporter and detained a journalist, among other incidents.

Bovino has been a visible figure since arriving in Chicago, posing for photo ops aboard a boat on the Chicago River and Downtown — most recently at the Bean in Millennium Park early Monday.

Bovino has also been an active participant in immigration raids across the city, seen on video tear-gassing crowds of residents in Little Village, among other incidents, and he is at the center of a federal lawsuit challenging agents’ use of force throughout the immigration crackdown.

Last week, federal Judge Sara L. Ellis blasted Bovino, saying he admitted in a deposition that he lied when claiming he was hit by a rock before tear-gassing people in Little Village.

At the same hearing, Ellis extended restrictions she put on federal immigration agents’ use of force and crowd control tactics. This week, the Trump administration filed an emergency appeal to the block the order, calling it “unworkable.”

And U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings plans to release on bond hundreds of people who have been detained by federal immigration agents in Chicago since June, which Bovino criticized during his appearance on Fox News Thursday.

“Whether they were criminals or individuals that were taking jobs from Americans — you name it, that’s what they were doing. And I’ll tell you what’s gonna happen,” Bovino said. “We’re gonna go even harder on the streets. If he releases those 650, we’re gonna apprehend 1,650 on the streets of Chicago.”

21 People Arrested Outside Broadview ICE Facility

A total of 21 people were arrested outside the ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview Friday “in connection with protests in Broadview around the facility being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” according to a release from the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

The arrests happened around 10 a.m. Friday, according to the release.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson criticized “out-of-town protesters” for causing injury to two of her suburb’s police officers as well as officers for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office and Illinois State Police, in a Friday statement.

“I have repeatedly pleaded to protesters to raise their voices, not their fists. They have chosen their fists,” Thompson said in her statement accusing demonstrators of violence.

The two Broadview officers and the Cook County police officers were taken to Loyola Hospital for treatment, Thompson said in the statement.

In early October, local and state police set up designated protest zones with barricades to keep protesters away from the ICE facility. The Cook County Sheriff’s Office also began sending out news releases about people arrested near the facility.

The 9 a.m. demonstration at the ICE facility started peacefully with people chanting and singing, the Sun-Times reported. Federal agents were not on the scene, and no tear gas, pepper balls or chemical agents were deployed, according to the Sun-Times.

Around 10 a.m. a group of protesters exited the designated protest zones and tried to walk toward the ICE facility, prompting state police to push protesters back, according to WGN.

Over the past several months, similar scenes have played out frequently in Broadview, which has become a flashpoint in Chicago’s resistance to President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement crackdown.

After attacking general human rights, Germany's ""he who must not be named"" began a shift to targeting minority rights, using the ideological construction of ""us vs. them"" with ethnic contours. The German state apparatus mobilized for large-scale violence under ideological justification.

In the U.S. today, immigration debates and enforcement often frame undocumented (and sometimes legal) immigrants as a separate category: a threat to public safety, a burden, potentially an ""enemy"" or outsider. For example:Critics of ICE point out that enforcement is increasingly aggressive and publicly politicized.

Public opinion shows ICE's popularity dropping significantly: by mid-2025, ICE's net favorability was negative, with a substantial share of Americans supporting its abolition.

The rhetoric of ""invasion,"" ""illegal aliens"" and ""dangerous criminals"" used by some officials creates an ""us vs. them"" tone.

This is not to suggest that at present the U.S. context mirrors the genocidal intent, breadth of violence or totalitarian state of the German 1930s and 1940s. The comparison is about mindset and mechanisms, not scale or moral equivalence.

One can observe certain parallels, with important caveats, in today's U.S. political climate around immigration enforcement and ICE. Germany's regime mobilized security units, eliminated resistance and institutionalized repression. Today, with legal U.S. citizens being detained, ICE has increased its enforcement reach, use of force and opaque operations. Plans for giant ""detention building facilities"" are being finalized.

Local law enforcement cooperation programs, such as here in Hamilton County, allow broader identification and immigrant arrests through local institutions. This trend of escalating state enforcement, blurring lines between civil and criminal law, increases pressure on immigrant communities.

Immigrant communities report heightened fear, reduced school attendance and community disruption due to raids and enforcement actions.

The U.S. system still has significant legal checks, constitutional protections, public accountability and open democratic debate — unlike the historic German regime which dismantled dissent and legal safeguards wholesale.

It is important to remember normalcy can shift; what once seemed extreme becomes everyday. The German regime gradually made mass violence computational and bureaucratized it.

In the U.S. today, the massive expansion of ICE's budget, increased resources for enforcement and recruitment drives for ICE agents suggests normalization of large-scale interior enforcement. Some tactics formerly considered extraordinary, such as unmarked vans and courthouse arrests, are now common daily.

The public's tolerance, or acquiescence, to large enforcement actions may shift over time.

The warning here is about how states may gradually scale enforcement and shift norms, making more extreme actions seem acceptable.

For those concerned about civil liberties, immigrant rights or democratic norms, these analogies offer a lens for vigilance — how easily rights erode when a state defines ""outsiders,"" grants extraordinary powers to enforcement agencies and suppresses or criminalizes dissent and resistance.

For policymakers and the public, the implication is to ask: Are enforcement powers proportionate? Are oversight, accountability and legal safeguards maintained? Is the framing of immigrants as the ""enemy within"" being used to justify broad powers? What do you think?

The two Oregon nonprofits that sued federal immigration agencies last month have added another plaintiff to their suit and are asking the court to stop federal agencies from blocking all people detained in Oregon from access to their lawyers.

The Clear Clinic, a Portland-based legal nonprofit, and Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, Oregon’s largest Latino labor union, sued the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the ICE field office in Seattle, as well as the leaders of each agency, in October alleging they are purposefully denying people in detention centers access to their lawyers before transferring them from Oregon to facilities in Washington, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.

The groups argue that under the U.S. Constitution, all detained people regardless of their immigration status have the right to speak with a lawyer before getting transferred.

The groups amended their complaint on Wednesday, adding plaintiff Leon X, a 32-year-old resident of Oregon who came to the United States from Mexico when he was 6 years old. He grew up in Oregon’s farmworker community, and he is using a pseudonym in court documents to protect the details of his own immigration case, according to the filing.

The plaintiffs’ lawyers argue Leon X represents a class of people who have been detained by ICE or are at risk of arrest for alleged civil immigration violations in the District of Oregon. He and the other plaintiffs are asking the court to stop federal immigration authorities from blocking him, and others who might be detained by ICE, from meeting with an attorney.

Innovation Law Lab Director of Legal Advocacy Tess Hellgren said plaintiffs are asking the court to require that federal immigration authorities give detainees access to their lawyers before they are transferred out of the District of Oregon. Innovation Law Lab is a nonprofit law firm representing the plaintiffs.

“Meaningful access to counsel requires notice, time and space to actually consult with attorneys,” Hellgren said.

Immigration authorities detained more than 300 people in Oregon in October, and there have been at least 150 detentions in November so far, according to Innovation Law Lab.

Attorneys at Innovation Law Lab have filed 13 habeas corpus petitions since June. These are court orders forcing law enforcement authorities to justify a person’s continued detention. Many of those detained have been freed from ICE detention under these petitions, including people who were detained outside their immigration hearings, a wildland firefighter who was detained while working at a remote and active fire and a wreath maker detained on her way to work, according to Innovation Law Lab.

“When they’re repeatedly told that judges who rule against a president — they are corrupt and they should be impeached.
The Trump administration has said federal authorities conducted a probe but that there was no “credible evidence” of criminal wrongdoing.
Judges that want to inject their own personal agenda into the law have no place on the bench,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.
“[Trump]’s got the bully pulpit and he’s got social media.","In a year full of judicial rebukes for the president — often followed by vindication for Trump at the Supreme Court — these judges’ fierce and direct assessments of the president have stood out. But there’s more than lofty rhetoric that binds them. All were appointed to the bench decades ago by the same president: Ronald Reagan.

Now a fourth member of the Reagan-era fraternity has joined them: U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf, who took the bench in Massachusetts 40 years ago on the same day as Young. Wolf resigned his senior judgeship last week with the sole purpose of speaking out against what he sees as Trump’s incursion on the rule of law and the high court’s acquiescence to it.

It’s not an accident. Not only do these Reagan-appointed judges wield their seniority as a weapon, but their legal and judicial careers were all forged in the embers of Watergate, when a president’s assertion of vast, unprecedented power threatened to topple the justice system. They all worked and clerked for attorneys and judges tasked with rebuilding confidence in the federal government after Richard Nixon’s resignation and saw in it a vindication of principled appeals to impartial justice.

In a wide-ranging interview with POLITICO, Wolf said his own upbringing as a public corruption prosecutor during that moment of rebuilding is what has contributed to his alarm today. He sees echoes of that era in Trump’s second term but is worried that Americans — who would not have tolerated such behavior in the Watergate era, he says — may be too conditioned to view the world through partisan lenses to respond similarly today.

“I don’t know where the American people are today,” Wolf lamented. “When they’re repeatedly told that judges who rule against a president — they are corrupt and they should be impeached. I’m afraid if the courts do not have the support they need … our rule of law and our democracy will be doomed.”

Wolf cited the case of Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, and reports that he accepted $50,000 in cash from an undercover FBI agent as part of a potential payoff for his work in a future Trump administration. The Trump administration has said federal authorities conducted a probe but that there was no “credible evidence” of criminal wrongdoing. Homan has denied that he took the money.

Wolf said now that the case is closed, he’s surprised there isn’t a louder public outcry — including from Republicans — to see the evidence.

“If there’s uninvestigated possible criminal activity by Mr. Homan, I think that should be a matter of significant public concern. And if the tape recordings and other evidence indicate that he did not engage in any illegal conduct, I think he deserves to be exonerated in the court of public opinion,” Wolf said. “I don’t know why Republicans in Congress, as well as Democrats, don’t ask for that.”

A White House spokesperson called the judge’s comments about Homan “hyper-partisan,” saying they “only further affirm Wolf’s decision to step down.”

“The blatantly political investigation into Tom found absolutely no evidence of illegal activity. Judges that want to inject their own personal agenda into the law have no place on the bench,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson said.

Wolf’s decision to speak out is also born of frustration with the Supreme Court’s overwhelming willingness to side with Trump despite the routine drubbings the president has taken in the lower courts.

“When Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa all started hitting 60 home runs or more when no one in the history of baseball except Babe Ruth and Roger Maris had ever hit 60 home runs, there was reason to suspect something improper was going on,” Wolf said. “When the president wins 17 out of 20 cases decided on the shadow docket, to me at least it raises a concern about whether there’s a possible lack of impartiality.”

Jackson said “the Trump Administration’s policies have been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as lawful despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful lower court rulings.”

Wolf noted that Lamberth, Young and Coughenour’s comments about Trump all came in their written opinions or courtroom statements, the limited forums that judges have to give voice to their concerns.

“My concern is that gets drowned out,” he said, suggesting that’s in part why he chose to step away from the bench to make his case publicly. “[Trump]’s got the bully pulpit and he’s got social media. The best response to bad speech is better speech.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F3d%2F65%2Fc5f069ba48c7bbf5bb0fedce9683%2Ftrump-government-shutdown-13957.jpg,N,,2025-11-14 18:58:21.713669
