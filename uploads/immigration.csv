They're citing reports that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order to kill defenseless survivors of a U.S. missile attack on a boat in the Caribbean Sea. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said “this rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true."" Ohio Republican Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations. President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have opened investigations supported by lawmakers from both parties into U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. They cited a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for surviving crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.

The lawmakers said that if true, the allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week pose serious legal concerns. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information on what happened. “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump is also weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

The Latest:

White House says Biden ‘recklessly released’ nearly 100,000 Afghans into the U.S.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pre-Thanksgiving shooting of two National Guard members in Washington shows it is “more important than ever to finish carrying out the president’s mass deportation operation.”

She said the Trump administration is “ensuring the monster responsible for this atrocity” is held accountable, and reckoning with what made the attack possible — including scrutinizing past immigration decisions involving Afghans and other migrants.

Leavitt blamed what she called Biden’s “historic failure in Afghanistan” and said it “continues to haunt this country and our men and women in uniform.”

South Carolina to send 300 National Guard troops to Washington this month

The troops were already set to go to the nation’s capital before last week’s shooting that killed one National Guard member and wounded another from West Virginia, Gov. Henry McMaster said.

The Republican governor said there are no plans to increase the number of soldiers after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard troops following last week’s shooting.

The governor noted South Carolina has also sent National Guard troops to the Mexican border and other places in the world.

“We’ll keep sending them, and they are willing to go and capable of going,” McMaster told reporters Monday.

The South Carolina troops will replace soldiers from Georgia. They were the replacements for the first round of South Carolina soldiers in Washington who returned home in September.

Melania Trump and Usha Vance write holiday cards for deployed service members

The wives of the president and vice president spoke briefly to the roughly 100 military spouses, American Red Cross volunteers and others gathered inside a hangar at Joint Base Andrews near the nation’s capital for the event.

The first lady praised the spouses for carrying “the weight of family life” while their husbands or wives are away from home serving the country.

Usha Vance, whose husband, Vice President JD Vance, is a former Marine, said the holiday season is a time to “lift up” those who serve.

After speaking, both women took up positions at tables to help stuff “comfort kits” as they were being filled with Rice Krispies treats, peanuts, granola bars and handwritten notes. They also joined others who were writing holiday cards for deployed service members.

The first lady wrote in one of her cards: “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Thank you for your service. Our nation is proud of you!” and signed it, “With warm wishes, Melania Trump.”

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

First lady Melania Trump reveals White House Christmas decorations

“Home is Where the Heart is” is the theme she chose for her family’s first Christmas back at the White House.

The decorations also nod to next year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the founding of the United States of America.

The gingerbread White House, an annual highlight dating to the Nixon administration, showcases the South Portico and provides a glimpse into the Yellow Oval room as decorated by the Trumps.

The Yellow Oval is a sitting room in the president’s private living quarters on the second floor of the White House.

Public tours resume on Tuesday.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

Rubio calls US-Ukraine talks on Russia war productive

U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war just days before a U.S. envoy is due in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It’s not just about the terms that ends fighting,” Rubio said. “It’s about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there’s more work to be done.”

The Republican administration is promising to pause entry to the United States from some poor nations and review Afghans and other legal migrants already in the country.

The government put an immediate pause on all asylum decisions, halted visas for individuals traveling from Afghanistan and said it would reexamine green card holders from 19 “high-risk countries of concern.”

The shooting also prompted President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security to float broader but less specific actions to restrict immigration and remove immigrants from the United States, including a stop to migration from “third-world countries,” the denaturalization of immigrants and a vision for “remigration.”

Trump administration officials announced the policy changes on social media after the Nov. 26 shooting. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, has been in critical condition with no updates as of Monday morning.

The shooter was among the 76,000 individuals from Afghanistan the Biden administration admitted in 2021 after the U.S withdrawal from the country, according to multiple media reports.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, posted on Nov. 28 that all asylum decisions would be put on hold, with no time given for when those processes would resume.

“USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” Edlow said. “The safety of the American people always comes first.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a similar message on protecting Americans in his announcement Nov. 28 that he would halt visas for people seeking to travel into the country from Afghanistan.

“President Trump’s State Department has paused visa issuance for ALL individuals traveling on Afghan passports,” Rubio said. “The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed the announcement asylum decisions would be put on hold, and announced DHS would engage in “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from all 19 high-risk countries of concern.”

“Under President Trump, we are putting the American people, our safety and national security FIRST,” Noem wrote Sunday on social media. “We are putting an end to idiotic policies that allowed millions of illegal aliens and hundreds of thousands of foreigners into our country unvetted.”

A DHS spokesperson confirmed on Monday that those countries are Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen.

Those are the same countries listed in a travel ban Trump issued in a presidential proclamation in June. A DHS memo dated Nov. 27 points to that proclamation and states the administration “will consider relevant country-specific facts and circumstances” when determining “discretionary benefit requests” from individuals from these countries.

These benefits, the memo states, include “certain adjustment of status applications, extension of nonimmigrant stay, and change of nonimmigrant status.”

Trump, speaking with reporters Sunday on Air Force One, said he would make sweeping changes such as a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” and an effort to “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

Trump said he would “absolutely” revoke the U.S. citizenship of certain immigrants if he had the authority to make the call.

“We have criminals that came into our country, and they were naturalized,” Trump said. “If I have the power to do it — I’m not sure that I do, but if I do — I would denaturalize. Absolutely.”

And Trump posted on social media Thursday he would “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump posted.

The DHS social media account on Friday posted about “remigration,” something it had also posted about in October along with a link to a mobile app the Trump administration has repurposed as a way for migrants to voluntarily self-deport.

The term has been used in connection with far-right groups in Europe as a concept for deporting the influx of non-white immigrants, some critics have pointed out.

Press Club v. Kristi Noem at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Drawing on nearly four decades of PHR research about the potential health harms of crowd-control weapons, PHR medical and legal experts reviewed court declarations and news reports on Trump administration immigration agents’ excessive and reckless force against peaceful demonstrators as well as journalists, medics, and bystanders at the L.A. protests. PHR finds that the court record and reporting indicate that federal agents used crowd-control weapons in a manner inconsistent with international standards such as the United Nations Guidance on Less-Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement.

“Crowd control weapons like rubber bullets, pepper balls, and tear gas may be labeled ‘less lethal,’ but medical research shows they can cause serious injury or even death. The risk of grave harms is even greater when law enforcement misuses these weapons as the court record indicates was the case in Los Angeles this summer,” said Michele Heisler, MD, MPA, medical director at PHR and professor of internal medicine and public health at University of Michigan.

“The court record shows that federal law enforcement in Los Angeles targeted the heads and faces of journalists and protestors with rubber bullets. They fired even at the backs of journalists and protestors,” said Dr. Heisler. “Federal agents also deployed vast quantities of tear gas and shot pepper balls and tear gas cannisters into groups of protestors when there was no evidence agents were being threatened. Officials fired dangerous disorientation devices like flashbangs into large crowds. The examples that the court highlighted show how federal law enforcement repeatedly misused crowd control weapons in a manner that risked serious injury to non-violent protestors, journalists, and bystanders.”

PHR’s analysis draws on a wide range of medico-legal documentation of the health and human rights harms of crowd-control weapons around the world. This includes Lethal in Disguise, a seminal report that offers the best available evidence of the deaths and severe injuries caused by kinetic impact projectiles (such as rubber bullets), chemical irritants (such as tear gas), and other crowd-control weapons in the United States and around the world.

PHR’s amicus brief highlights some of the severe injuries documented in the court record and news accounts as resulting from federal agents’ misuse of crowd-control weapons. For example, Ryanne Mena, a journalist who was covering protests in Paramount, was hit just an inch above her right ear with what is believed to have been a rubber bullet, resulting in a concussion. Alexander Nadolishny, a 55-year-old engineer attending the protests in Camarillo, was hit in the ear with a pepper ball as he was running away from the protest. Agents fired tear gas on a group of protestors in Paramount, including the 52-year-old Diya Cruz, which triggered an asthma attack for Cruz.

Following the summer 2025 protests in Los Angeles, a coalition of journalists, legal observers, protestors, and journalist associations sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Their complaint alleged that in June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched an operation to arrest immigrants in and around Los Angeles, “setting new sky-high targets for daily immigration arrests and expanding the scope of its operations far beyond immigrants with criminal histories.” Plaintiffs alleged that DHS responded to protests over these immigration raids with excessive force by using tear gas, pepper balls, chemical spray, and rubber bullets.

The court granted the preliminary injunction on September 10, finding that federal agents’ use of force has been and would continue to be disruptive to both peaceful protest and media coverage.

In its new amicus brief, PHR urges the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to uphold the district court’s granting of the preliminary injunction in order to prevent the further dangerous and harmful misuse of crowd control weapons that has been visited upon protestors and journalists in Los Angeles.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration.
Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.
“A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.
But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website.","Gutting of key US watchdog could pave way for grave immigration abuses, experts warn

This article features Government Accountability Project and was originally published here.

The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

A group of fired watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP), and a coalition of human rights organizations sued the administration, demanding the employees be reinstated. There is deepening concern that a system of oversight that was already weak is now hanging by a thread, even as criticism surges over treatment of detainees in the ballooning immigration jail network.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.”

The DHS has repeatedly, through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, insisted when asked about reports and complaints of abuses that there are “no sub-prime” conditions in immigration custody in the US.

But Dana Gold, a senior director of the GAP, which is working with those behind the whistleblower complaint, echoed Enriquez’s warning.

Without a robust oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity”, she said.

The second Trump administration early on fired hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, typically known as watchdogs.

This included at the DHS. The main watchdog team there overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine. This despite there being about 550 investigations that were active and alleging serious civil rights violations by DHS officials and contractors, including inside immigration detention centers.

Cases that were active when Trump returned to office include civil rights officials then in post investigating allegations of civil and human rights abuses, according to CRCL documents that were previously public, original complaint records submitted to the CRCL and the whistleblower disclosure, reviewed by the Guardian. Among the cases, were the following allegations:

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document. This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint.

This last one, into Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents for his pro-Palestinian activism, was one of the final investigations launched before the mass firing of civil rights watchdog officials in March.

The status of these investigations, and hundreds more, is unknown. Enquiries by the Guardian to the DHS last week about the above specific cases and the many others previously understood to be active elicited no response.

However, in response to requests for comment by the Guardian, also submitted to DHS last week, McLaughlin issued a statement, saying: “These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.”

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.

“CRCL and OIDO, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, regularly inspect detention facilities, document conditions in accord with facility standards, investigate detainee complaints, and issue recommendations to ICE and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] when appropriate.”

An investigation by the Guardian based on interviews with five recently dismissed DHS civil rights officials, hundreds of pages of documents, and interviews with immigration attorneys, has found that the already limited oversight practiced within the DHS prior to January 2025 now appears almost nonexistent.

Of the nine people now working at the CRCL, one is its acting officer, installed in May, Troup Hemenway, a former adviser to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint for conservative government.

Congress originally tasked the three offices, including CRCL, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) and the Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS), with oversight at DHS. The watchdog bodies process complaints, initiate investigations and provide guidance to DHS agencies in various areas of interest.

Now, those operations have seemingly been halted, or at least significantly slowed.

In recent months, the former DHS officials who have filed the whistleblower complaint have watched as the Trump administration has targeted political adversaries, expelled immigrants to a foreign prison, allowed officials to arrest immigrants at court appearances, encouraged officers to wear face coverings during arrests and targeted people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal record.

Few know much about what is happening behind closed doors inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and at secretive holding facilities.

Former DHS employees the Guardian spoke with, who were dismissed from their positions at CRCL, spoke with the Guardian on condition of anonymity to discuss matters more freely and avoid retaliation.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration. “That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.”

One morning in late March, top DHS officials emailed employees at the three oversight offices, ordering them to stop working. Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.

A coalition of immigrant rights organizations sued the administration in Washington, declaring the cuts illegal and demanding all oversight employees be reinstated. According to a declaration filed by a top DHS official, , [sic.] nearly every single employee from the offices was fired, including 147 employees at the CRCL, 118 at the OIDO and 46 at CIS.

The Trump administration wants “no oversight into what they are doing,” said Enriquez from RFK Human Rights.

Following the lawsuit, the DHS walked back its claims that the offices were being abolished. Instead they told the federal judge they reduced the number of staff in order to “refocus” the offices and “create more efficient processes.” The internal oversight work was continuing, the DHS said, arguing the lawsuit should be tossed.

Throughout litigation, the administration has put out various staffing figures, most recently that only nine people total, including Hemenway, now worked at CRCL. Five of them are “contract” investigators, meaning that as of August, there were only two full-time CRCL investigators. Fifteen additional contractors are also reportedly at CRCL, according to the DHS court declaration, exclusively focusing on internal Equal Employment Opportunity cases for DHS employees.

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,” the former official explained in a telephone interview with the Guardian.

“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.”

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections”, the former official added.

Gold, at the GAP, said of the whistleblowers she is working with: “The idea that getting rid of basically every employee with institutional knowledge and replacing them with just a few – in the wake of daily multiple examples of the kinds of things that CRCL would have dealt with – is just deeply disturbing to them.”

Oversight at the DHS “is a guardrail that has been deliberately decimated to make sure that sand is not put in the gears of executive branch priorities”, Gold added.

Many CRCL investigations focused on complaints inside ICE detention centers, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse and deaths in custody, the whistleblower complaint said. Now, the Trump administration is further expanding its immigration detention network.

“ I don’t think they care about the conditions of these facilities. I think they’re just trying to round up as many people as they can and get rid of them without any due process and without any regard for conditions,” said the former official, who worked on CRCL investigations into allegations of abuse at several facilities.

A third former official, speaking to the Guardian, warned of dangers for immigrants targeted by ICE.

“If there isn’t oversight that keeps pace, the potential for real danger is great,” that former official said, adding: “You are left to ICE policing itself.”

In 2023, the CRCL’s compliance branch received 3,104 complaints and investigated 25% of them, according to a report to congress.

“I don’t know if they’re actually reading and investigating those complaints or doing anything with the complaints,” said the former CRCL official quoted first in this report.

Sophia Genovese, an immigration attorney and faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center, has submitted over 100 complaints to CRCL.

“Nine people can’t cover a detention center, much less an entire country – especially with so many new detention centers popping up left and right,” she said. “It’s laughable that they think that they can do anything with so few staff.”

As the Trump administration ramps up its enforcement operations, Genovese is seeing an increase of cases of ICE threatening physical violence on immigrants, pressuring them to self-deport – an allegation CRCL would have likely investigated.

“I’m getting referrals every day from people who have family members who are picked up, detained and are being coerced into signing deportation orders,” said Genovese.

Immigrant advocates for years were already frustrated with CRCL’s limited powers. Typically after an investigation, CRCL officials make recommendations to DHS agencies to improve their civil rights practices but can rarely mandate changes.

“Structurally speaking, the way congress set up the agency, there were some real weaknesses,” said Enriquez from RFK. But he argues that any oversight, no matter how limited, is significantly better than no oversight. “A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.

That appears highly unlikely in the current climate.

Gold said of CRCL: “Even with its weaknesses at some level, it did investigations, it could mitigate problems and it provided a really important oversight function – also in terms of just getting information to Congress to do [additional] oversight. And without that, there’s just a blank check for impunity.”

CRCL always used to publish memos about completed investigations and those they were initiating, which, Genovese said, journalists and attorneys found valuable in helping reveal conditions inside ICE detention centers and other problems within the DHS.

But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website. (The Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, later published the majority of the CRCL public records after they were scrubbed by the DHS).

“It’s a real breakdown in the rule of law. It’s really concerning,” said one former CRCL official. “It’s very upsetting.”

The main avenue of resort now is public protest and legal action, Genovese said.

“We’re seeing really incredible acts of bravery by members of the public,” she said. “That’s been helpful at preventing detention in some ways, but also educating the public about the horrors of detention.”",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shutterstock_71874889-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:57:31.730771

But a new lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C., suggests what happened to Nemer — and why — has the potential to scramble the federal workforce and upend foundational civil rights laws.

Nemer alleges that despite top performance reviews, she was dismissed from her job because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat. Those reasons, she says, are all in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the First Amendment.

The government has responded by arguing that the president's power to oversee the executive branch under Article II of the U.S. Constitution essentially overrides that core civil rights law, Nemer's attorney said.

""This is a case in which the President of the United States has asserted a constitutional right to discriminate against federal employees,"" wrote her lawyer, Nathaniel Zelinsky, of the Washington Litigation Group. ""If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.""

The administration abruptly fired Nemer in early February, summoning her from the bench and escorting her out of a federal building in Cleveland. Both her supervisor and the chief immigration judge there told her they didn't know why she was being dismissed in the middle of her probationary period, the lawsuit said.

Federal workers on probationary status have fewer rights to contest their firing than other civil servants do, but they are still covered by constitutional protections barring retaliation for their political speech; and by civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex and national origin.

Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office a month after she was fired. That office dismissed her claims in September, asserting in its decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act conflicts with the president's power to remove federal workers within the executive branch.

The implications sweep far beyond a single immigration judge, the new lawsuit said.

""According to the final agency decision, the President may now fire female federal workers like Ms. Nemer — because of their sex — and the law would have nothing to say about it,"" according to the new lawsuit. ""According to the final agency decision, the President can now fire federal workers born to immigrant parents with dual citizenship like Ms. Nemer — because of their national origin — and they would have no recourse. And under the same logic, the President can fire federal workers like Ms. Nemer — because of their political activities and affiliations — and the courts would be powerless to act.""

Nemer is seeking reinstatement, back pay and an order erasing her termination.

She said she never got official notice about any reasons for her dismissal.

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says ICE plans to deploy roughly 50 agents this week.

Know and assert rights: remain silent, request a lawyer, refuse consented searches.

Prepare documents and emergency plans; learn about local legal aid and support groups.

Just weeks after large-scale Border Patrol operations rattled communities in Charlotte and Raleigh, immigrant-rights advocates say another wave of federal agents is headed for the Triangle.

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says it learned that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deploy 50 agents to the Triangle region this week, The News & Observer previously reported.

The news comes after Border Patrol agents were deployed to Charlotte during “Operation Charlotte’s Web” and to the Triangle last month, where hundreds of people were detained.

Here’s what you need to know.

What to do if law enforcement asks about your immigration status

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), if law enforcement asks about your immigration status, you should stay calm and keep your hands visible. Don’t run, argue or resist, and never lie or show false documents.

It’s also important to know your rights:

You have the right to stay silent and don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

If asked by immigration agents, show your papers only if you have them.

You can refuse a search, since agents need your consent or probable cause.

If you’re over 18, carry your papers. If you don’t have them, say you want to remain silent or speak to a lawyer.

If you get pulled over, you must show your license, registration and proof of insurance, but you don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

What to do if ICE agents show up at your home

If immigration agents show up at your home, the ACLU says you should:

Ask if they’re immigration agents and what they’re there for.

Request to see their badge or ID through a window or peephole.

Ask if they have a judge-signed warrant and have them show it under the door or against the window.

Don’t open the door unless they show a judicial warrant with your name or address. Say: “I don’t consent to your entry.”

If they force entry, don’t resist. Say you’re exercising your right to remain silent and want to speak to a lawyer.

Don’t lie, show false documents, or sign anything before talking to a lawyer.

If you’re on probation with a search condition, officers may legally enter your home.

What to do if you are arrested or detained by ICE

If you are detained by ICE or Border Patrol, you can hire a lawyer, but one won’t be provided, according to the ACLU. However, you can ask for a list of free or low-cost options.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

What to do if a loved one is arrested or detained

If a loved one is arrested or detained by ICE, you can try looking for them on the ICE Detainee Locator page, according to Carolina Migrant Network.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

To search, you need:

The detained person’s Alien Registration Number (A-Number).

Their first and last name.

Country of origin.

Date of birth.

If your loved one is not listed in the system, you can try calling nearby detention centers. You can find a list of nearby detention centers at ice.gov/detention-facilities.

How to prepare for ICE ahead of time

Here are some ways you can prepare ahead of time if ICE arrives in the Triangle, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center:

Keep emergency contact numbers for family handy.

Make a plan for who can take care of children, pets, or property if someone is detained. You should also keep this document handy and never share it with law enforcement.

You can also try reaching out to local support groups that provide free services, such as legal clinics and rapid response help.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information on what happened. “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump is also weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

First lady Melania Trump reveals White House Christmas decorations

“Home is Where the Heart is” is the theme she chose for her family’s first Christmas back at the White House.

The decorations also nod to next year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the founding of the United States of America.

The gingerbread White House, an annual highlight dating to the Nixon administration, showcases the South Portico and provides a glimpse into the Yellow Oval room as decorated by the Trumps.

The Yellow Oval is a sitting room in the president’s private living quarters on the second floor of the White House.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

▶ Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy

Rubio calls US-Ukraine talks on Russia war productive

U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war just days before a U.S. envoy is due in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It’s not just about the terms that ends fighting,” Rubio said. “It’s about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there’s more work to be done.”

The Republican administration is promising to pause entry to the United States from some poor nations and review Afghans and other legal migrants already in the country.

Trump says he’ll release MRI scans

“If you want to have it released, I’ll release it,” the president said during an exchange with reporters as he traveled back to Washington from Florida.

He called the results of the October tests “perfect,” but said he could not recall which part of his body was scanned.

Ms. Habba, 41, had represented Mr. Trump in several civil cases and played a public role in his 2024 presidential campaign.
When Ms. Grace was fired, the Trump administration designated Ms. Habba to fill her role as first assistant — the highest-ranking position in the office given that there was no U.S. attorney — and argued that doing so meant that Ms. Habba was effectively acting U.S. attorney.
For good measure, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, also appointed Ms. Habba a “special attorney” with jurisdiction over New Jersey.","A federal appeals court said on Monday that Alina Habba had been serving unlawfully as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, dealing a blow to the Trump administration and most likely setting up a showdown at the Supreme Court.

Ms. Habba is one of a number of U.S. attorneys whom the Trump administration has sought to keep in power through a series of unusual maneuvers even though she was neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed by district trial court judges — the two traditional pathways. Defendants in New Jersey had challenged her authority as U.S. attorney, leading to Monday’s decision.

In its ruling, the three-judge panel, based in Philadelphia, affirmed an earlier ruling by a Federal District Court judge. The court said that the government’s tactics had violated the law as written and concluded that, overall, the Trump administration appeared to have become frustrated by legal and political barriers to placing its favored U.S. attorneys in charge.

It was not immediately clear how the ruling would affect legal proceedings in the New Jersey federal courts or whether Ms. Habba will continue to lead the office in the near future. The courts had already been operating in a kind of limbo, given her uncertain status. Certain types of criminal cases were slowed, and some grand jury proceedings were halted.

The Justice Department and a spokeswoman for Ms. Habba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The lawyers who challenged Ms. Habba’s authority, Abbe D. Lowell, Gerald Krovatin and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the ruling showed that “President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.”

They vowed to continue their challenges to “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys.”

The case involving Ms. Habba may be the first of its kind to reach the Supreme Court, though it is possible that a similar case involving the U.S. attorney in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, could be expedited by virtue of being entangled with criminal cases against President Trump’s enemies.

Last week, a federal judge found that Ms. Halligan, too, had been unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. The Justice Department has vowed to appeal.

Ms. Habba, 41, had represented Mr. Trump in several civil cases and played a public role in his 2024 presidential campaign. But she had no experience in criminal law before the president named her in March to a 120-day interim term as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor. Mr. Trump nominated her to take on the role permanently, but her appointment was doomed by opposition from the state’s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim.

In July, judges in the District of New Jersey declined to extend Ms. Habba’s term and instead tapped a veteran prosecutor, Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. That led Attorney General Pam Bondi to disparage the judges, fire Ms. Grace and elevate Ms. Habba to the role of acting U.S. attorney through a complicated series of maneuvers that were at the heart of the appeal.

But on Monday, the three judges — L. Felipe Restrepo, D. Brooks Smith and D. Michael Fisher — said that each of those maneuvers had violated the complex set of laws that governs vacancies at the top of federal agencies.

When Ms. Grace was fired, the Trump administration designated Ms. Habba to fill her role as first assistant — the highest-ranking position in the office given that there was no U.S. attorney — and argued that doing so meant that Ms. Habba was effectively acting U.S. attorney.

For good measure, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, also appointed Ms. Habba a “special attorney” with jurisdiction over New Jersey.

But the judges wrote that the automatic elevation of the first assistant occurred only at the actual time of the vacancy, and that neither the president nor anyone else could jury-rig that process. As for the special attorney appointment, they said, it was “plainly prohibited” by law.

The Monday decision affirms a ruling by Matthew W. Brann, the chief judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, who concluded in August that Ms. Habba had been serving as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney without legal authority since July 1.

Lawyers with the Department of Justice, which had appealed Judge Brann’s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, had argued that the president’s power was broad and gave the executive branch “substantial authority to decide who is executing the criminal laws of the United States.”

Lawyers for Cesar Humberto Pina, a defendant indicted in New Jersey on fraud charges on July 10, had countered that Ms. Habba’s installation as the state’s top prosecutor violated a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

The lawyers, Mr. Lowell and Mr. Krovatin, said in court papers that Mr. Trump had “pursued a shell game to keep her in power.”

“Relying on a chimera of at least seven different statutes, the government has, at various times, described Ms. Habba as ‘interim U.S. attorney,’ ‘acting U.S. attorney,’ ‘first assistant U.S. attorney’ and ‘special attorney,’” they wrote. “But she does not have the authority to lead the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey under any of those titles.”

Monday’s ruling was the second time in a week that a federal appeals court panel has dealt a heavy blow to Mr. Trump and Ms. Habba.

On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals based in Atlanta upheld nearly $1 million in penalties meted out by a lower court judge against the president and Ms. Habba for filing “frivolous” lawsuits against more than two dozen of his enemies, including Hillary Clinton, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and the Democratic National Committee.

A doorbell video of law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents visiting a home in Burlington Township on Nov. 8 has gone viral on social media.

The seven-minute video, posted to Facebook by U.S. Rep. Herb Conaway, D-New Jersey, shows masked officers speaking with the homeowner through the Ring doorbell. The homeowner's identity was redacted for their privacy and safety, a representative of Conaway's office said.

According to the congressman, the officers were on private property and ""harassing"" the homeowner without a warrant.

In a statement provided to this publication, Conaway said the video was ""another instance of ICE and federal agents acting lawlessly toward American citizens.""

""I am appalled by what is happening, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in D.C. to do everything we can to hold those responsible accountable,"" he added.

The post has received more than 52,000 reactions and nearly 19,000 comments.

Immigration concerns, and scrutiny over ICE operations, have been a rising topic of conversation over the last year in South Jersey and across the U.S., spurred by new ICE policies, talks of building a potential detainee center in Burlington County and arrests of community leaders pending immigration hearings.

According to the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics dashboard, there were 1,649 arrests out of the Newark and Philadelphia offices during the 2025 fiscal year.

The video, which was sent to Conaway's office by a constituent, showed at least four masked officers identifying themselves as federal agents on the homeowner's lawn and front porch area.

When told that the homeowner was out of town, one agent questioned the cars parked outside. When asked why they were wearing masks, an agent said, ""It's cold out here, ma'am.""

The agents continued to knock on the homeowner's door, questioning her through the camera about the individual they were looking for, whose name was redacted for privacy.

The agents continued to knock on the door and peer through windows after the homeowner told them that nobody was home and that they were out of town for a death in the family.

""For people in the community who are concerned, or who have neighbors worried that this could potentially happen to them, I encourage you all to learn your rights if you encounter such a situation,"" Conaway said.

Multidistrict litigation now makes up well over half of all federal civil cases, with lawsuits that address product liability and other topics consolidated before one judge to avoid them being filed in different courts and resulting in potentially different pretrial rulings. The new rule, 16.1 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is meant to give judges and parties a framework to get those cases off the ground, while still giving them the chance to modify them as needed for each case.

Those opening steps include an initial management conference to figure out pretrial proceedings. The rule also says parties should provide a report ahead of that conference to lay out their views on whether leadership counsel should be appointed in the case, and if so, what their roles should be.

Parties should also tell the court their initial views on discovery in the litigation, how parties will share information about the factual bases behind their arguments, and the main factual and legal issues that are likely to come up, the rule says.

Some lawyers told Bloomberg Law they had concerns about earlier drafts of the rule, saying too much rigidity would hurt the MDL process by forcing courts to follow steps that don’t fit all cases. The Judicial Conference’s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure unanimously approved a version that its authors said was meant to be adaptable.

“Not all MDL proceedings present the management challenges this rule addresses, and, thus, it is important to maintain flexibility in managing MDL proceedings,” reads the committee note attached to the rule, which gives additional guidance to judges interpreting it.

The judiciary’s policymaking body—the Judicial Conference—and later the Supreme Court approved the rule. It was among a slate of rule changes sent to Congress, which permitted the measures to go into effect.

A draft of the rule was presented for public comment in 2023, but got pushback from plaintiffs’ attorneys over a provision that said judges could appoint “coordinating counsel” to deal with logistics in the case. Drafters dropped the language after that testimony.

Some plaintiffs’ lawyers also testified that they thought too many topics were included in the list of items that could be addressed at the initial hearing. The advisory committee drafting the rule said it’s not meant to serve as a mandatory agenda that requires a view on each listed issue.

Class action lawyers also told Bloomberg Law the rule seemed focused more on mass tort MDLs rather than their cases, which commonly involve data breaches, privacy, and antitrust issues.

The rule has its supporters. Implementing initial steps in the cases gives a pathway for finding and dismissing claims that don’t belong in the litigation, said Alex Dahl, general counsel for the advocacy group Lawyers for Civil Justice, which has pushed for the new MDL rule.

“This rule should strongly discourage the filing of meritless claims and give courts and parties an effective mechanism for identifying and dismissing them at the early stages of a new MDL,” Dahl said in a statement.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/eb1ce7e/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2F4b%2F52a782f344e585a6f94e286ac0f4%2Fgettyimages-634444702.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:30.721654

DRIVING THE DAY

HAPPY MONDAY: It’s only 6 a.m. on Monday morning, and it’s already a difficult week to be Pete Hegseth. The Defense secretary is now facing multiple inquiries into a lethal attack he ordered on a Venezuelan ship in September, following reporting in the Washington Post that a second deadly missile strike was ordered by U.S. forces specifically to kill off two shipwrecked survivors.

Questions, questions: President Donald Trump last night told reporters he will “find out” what happened in the Sept. 2 attack, adding a presidential line of inquiry to the two congressional oversight investigations launched at the end of last week. Venezuela’s national assembly last night also set up a special commission to investigate the attack, per Reuters.

Recap: You’ve presumably already read WaPo’s original story from last Friday, but in case not, here’s the link. Hegseth is reported to have issued a verbal order to “kill everybody” to U.S. commanders who were monitoring an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean. WaPo reports they took him at his word — and struck the ship with a second deadly missile, after two survivors of the first attack were spotted clinging to the wreckage.

Right of reply: Hegseth has dismissed the story as “fabricated,” and was last night merrily posting AI-generated images making light of Caribbean missile strikes that have now killed close to 100 people.

But this story looks like it has legs. Here’s why:

First: Congress is taking these allegations extremely seriously. Democrats like Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) are using the phrase “war crime.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for full, unedited video of the attack to be released. Republicans including Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said the reported actions, if true, would be illegal. Most significantly, the Senate Armed Services Committee announced it will be “conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts.” The House Armed Services Committee will do the same.

Second: Trump sounded intriguingly lukewarm last night when asked about the story on Air Force One. The president’s typical reaction to this type of reporting is either to aggressively dismiss it as “fake news” or a “Democrat hoax,” or to lean in and embrace the supposed offense as a positive. (An example: When it was put to Trump his immigration enforcers were going too far in Chicago, he shot back: “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”)

But Trump didn’t say any of that last night. “I don’t know anything about it,” the president told reporters on Air Force One when asked about the story, thus carefully distancing himself from his government’s actions. “[Hegseth] said he did not say that, and I believe him, 100 percent.”

So would Trump have supported a second strike? “We’ll look into it,” Trump said. “But no, I wouldn’t have wanted that. Not a second strike. Uh, the first strike was very lethal, it was fine. And if there were two people around …” He trailed off. “But Pete said that didn’t happen.”

Pressed again if there had been a second strike, Trump said: “I don’t know. I’ve gotta find out about it. But, uh, Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

So in short: More than two days after WaPo broke the story, the president can offer no assurances about what actually happened, says he would not have supported a second strike on the ship and will now be figuring out what happened himself. It’s hardly a ringing endorsement of the Pentagon leadership.

But Hegseth is typically unruffled. On Friday he dismissed the story as “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” before leaning into the approach taken by U.S. forces. “As we’ve said from the beginning … these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes,’” Hegseth wrote on X. “Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.”

More noise: Hegseth’s Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has since said the “entire narrative” was “false.” White House comms director Steven Cheung added yesterday: “The Washington Compost provided NO FACTS and NO SUBSTANTIATION. They literally just printed what some unnamed random person said and reported it as fact.”

The important context here is that plenty of Republicans and supporters were already deeply unnerved by U.S. activity in the Caribbean — both the legality of the boat strikes, and the risk America is about to be sucked into a broader conflict. Trump made the case for military action again last night, claiming each destroyed boat would have cost “25,000 American lives” due to the quantities of illegal drugs on board. The president is well aware that getting tough with drug traffickers plays well with both Hill Republicans and core MAGA voters.

But there’s a problem here too: At the weekend Trump just happened to pardon a convicted drug trafficker in Juan Orlando Hernández, a former Honduran leader who a U.S. jury found to be facilitating mass shipments of cocaine into America. (The NYT has a great piece on the jaw-dropping nature of Trump’s decision.) Even in an age of truly bonkers use of the pardon power, this is causing huge consternation to Hill Republicans who have been out there trying to defend Trump’s Caribbean policy to a skeptical public.

Heard this one before: Trump last night blamed Hernández’ conviction on Joe Biden, and said a pardon was the correct decision. Let’s see how many GOP senators agree when they start returning back to the Hill later today.

All of which means: This is definitely a good day for the Pentagon to welcome some less independent-minded media types in for a chat. The new-look Pentagon press corps — the fringe, largely conservative outlets who were willing to sign up to Hegseth’s subservient reporting rules, in exchange for access — have their first on-site briefings starting today. “Press secretary Kingsley Wilson is scheduled to conduct a briefing for the new media crew, which is then set to have a meet-and-greet and press gaggle” with Hegseth, WaPo reports.

MEANWHILE IN MOSCOW: Venezuela is hardly the only overseas issue dominating the president’s time this week. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner head to Moscow today ahead of their expected summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, with all Ukraine holding its breath. Witkoff is expected to take with him the latest contours of a Kyiv-approved peace plan to elicit a response from Putin.

Latest from the Ukraine side: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris today. Three of Zelenskyy’s top officials met with Witkoff, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Miami yesterday. The WSJ reports the meeting was hailed as “productive” and “included talks on possible elections, land swaps and security guarantees.”

TRAIL MIX

FEELING SPECIAL: It’s the final day of campaigning before the special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, and Republicans are sprinting to ensure that what should be an easy victory does not turn into another disaster. Trump will hold a tele-rally this evening with Speaker Mike Johnson to bolster Republican Matt Van Epps, as Axios reported last week. Before that, Johnson will rally with Van Epps in Franklin at 9 a.m. Eastern and in Clarksville at 6 p.m., where RNC Chair Joe Gruters will join. The national intervention follows multiple Trump Truth Social posts over the weekend urging Tennesseans to pick Van Epps over Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who he claimed “openly disdains Country music” — a reference to resurfaced comments Behn made in 2020 — among other things.

The stakes: In this Trump +22 district, which stretches from Nashville’s Music Row through wealthy suburbs to rural areas, Van Epps is still the favorite, despite some polling showing a tight race, USA Today’s Joey Garrison and Zac Anderson preview. Though the predictive ability of special elections can be limited, a slim Van Epps win — let alone a Behn shocker, which would narrow the GOP’s House majority — would make Democrats feel good about the midterms. But Republicans have lately projected optimism that they’ve sufficiently galvanized national attention to turn out the base. They’re highlighting Behn’s progressive activism and social media comments, while she focuses intently on affordability, as CNN has reported.

Also happening tomorrow: Jersey City, New Jersey, heads to a mayoral runoff that pits former Gov. Jim McGreevey against Councilmember James Solomon, POLITICO’s Matt Friedman and Ry Rivard preview. Both are Democrats, and the race is nonpartisan. But the election offers voters another high-profile clash between younger progressives and older establishment figures, in a city once synonymous with the Garden State’s political machine — and in the shadow of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC.

RED-LIGHT REDISTRICT: Indiana state Sen. Jean Leising, one of the holdouts who has helped prevent Republicans from pushing through a new congressional gerrymander, was targeted by a pipe bomb threat at her home this weekend, she announced. Leising blamed the “D.C. political pundits” pushing mid-decade redistricting and said she “will not cave.”

PRIMARY COLORS: Even as Democrats increasingly feel upbeat about the midterms, they’re also staring down a number of high-profile, hard-fought House primaries in both safe seats and swing seats that could rend the party ideologically and generationally. POLITICO’s Nick Wu and colleagues run down the contests to watch, from California to Maine. Republicans by comparison foresee smoother sailing in the primaries.

IMMIGRATION FILES

THE CRACKDOWN CONTINUES: Trump’s series of targeted immigration enforcement operations turns to its next big city today as “Swamp Sweep” kicks off in and around New Orleans, AP’s Jack Brook and colleagues preview. Some 250 border agents will begin a push — led by Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, just as in LA, Chicago and Charlotte — that intends to secure 5,000 arrests in Louisiana and Mississippi. Similarly aggressive tactics are expected. Most unauthorized immigrants in Louisiana are Honduran.

Preparations underway: Like in those other places that have seen the Border Patrol sweep in, immigrant communities around New Orleans are hunkering down, planning to stay home or get out of the area. Taqueria Guerrero, a prominent Mexican restaurant, is closing temporarily out of concern for staff and customers, Nola.com’s Ian McNulty reports.

The national impact: Other cities are still sorting through the effects of Border Patrol bursts that rounded up thousands of people. Though DHS has emphasized the arrests of “the worst” violent criminals, WaPo’s Arelis Hernández and colleagues report that just a fraction of the more than 4,000 arrested in Chicago have been publicly identified as having serious criminal records. Meanwhile, people who oppose the mass deportation campaign around the country have trained in rapid-response tactics to monitor immigration agents, NBC’s Nicole Acevedo reports. Many Japanese Americans whose families recall internment camps are especially motivated and involved in and around the LA area, NYT’s Jill Cowan reports.

D.C. SHOOTING FALLOUT: At the same time, the Trump administration is growing more determined to limit immigration after an Afghan refugee was charged with shooting two National Guard troops in D.C, killing one. Trump said yesterday that he’s invited the parents of both the late Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe to the White House at some point to honor their children, per the AP. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said this weekend that Wolfe is still “fighting for his life.” AG Pam Bondi said on Fox News that she’ll meet with his family.

Knowing Rahmanullah Lakanwal: The suspected shooter worked in secretive “Zero Units” in Afghanistan in coordination with the CIA, Afghan groups that had intense and dangerous combat assignments to go after the Taliban, NBC’s Dan De Luce and Rich Schapiro report. These were “among the most extensively vetted of any Afghans who worked with American forces.” Many have struggled with unresolved legal work status since coming to the U.S.

BEST OF THE REST

FIRST IN POLITICO — The ACA debate: As Congress returns today, the debate over expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies will take center stage — particularly as the cost of living and fears of premium spikes dominate the campaign trail. While some Republicans talk about an extension of the tax credits that makes changes, like further abortion restrictions, Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All are warning Democrats not to fold on a clean extension. “Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom for All will score any vote that adds additional abortion restrictions to the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the organizations are announcing to members in a new letter today. Read it here

The big question: What about Trump? With just a few weeks left to figure out a solution, both parties on the Hill say a decision by the president — who has sent mixed signals so far — will be pivotal to determining what comes of this sprint, POLITICO’s Jordain Carney reports. A Senate vote on something will take place next week. It’s not clear what. Republicans have multiple competing proposals in the ether, from an extension with reforms to a comprehensive Obamacare overhaul. And Democrats aren’t unified on how much to budge either. More from POLITICO’s Inside Congress

Ailing America: In West Virginia, many ACA recipients are steeling themselves for a financial crisis if premiums explode — as in 150 percent increases or more — without the same subsidies, FT’s Guy Chazan reports from Charleston. The cliff looms just as some of the sweeping health care cuts in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act start to hit. SNAP recipients who just got food stamps back after the shutdown-triggered lapse could start to lose them in March due to new work requirements, CNN’s Tami Luhby reports. And CNN’s Eva McKend has the story of Churchville, Virginia, where a health clinic cited the Medicaid cuts when it closed.

SCOTUS WATCH: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments beginning at 10 a.m. in two cases, including a landmark internet piracy case that examines whether Cox Communications has to pay out $1 billion in damages to dozens of record labels for not stopping copyright infringement. It’s “a case both sides say could have huge consequences for both the industry and internet users,” USA Today’s Maureen Groppe previews.

WHAT LARRY ELLISON IS READING: “White House officials have raised antitrust concerns over Netflix’s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery: sources,” by the N.Y. Post’s Charles Gasparino: “Senior White House officials recently discussed antitrust concerns surrounding Netflix’s interest in acquiring the Warner Bros. studio and the HBO Max streaming service … Several White House officials also suggested during the sitdown that a broader investigation is necessary focusing on Netflix’s market power … The meeting comes as the Warner Bros. Discovery board has scheduled a Monday afternoon deadline to receive a second round of offers.”

FED UP: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a Stanford University event at 8 p.m. Eastern, with nine days to go until the central bank’s fraught upcoming decision on interest rates. Trump told reporters yesterday that he’s already decided on his pick to succeed Powell, though he didn’t reveal the name yet, per Bloomberg.

SIGNS OF WITHDRAWAL: “Record-setting personnel issues are marring Trump’s second term,” by POLITICO’s Jordain Carney and colleagues: “Trump has withdrawn 57 nominations, according to Senate data … The pace of withdrawals, the highest since at least the Ronald Reagan presidency, has flown below the radar in the day-to-day churn.”

BEHIND THE DOCUMENT DUMP: “Robert Garcia leads Democrats’ strategy on Epstein probe, to GOP’s dismay,” by the LA Times’ Ana Ceballos: “Rep. Robert Garcia and his team faced a monumental task on Nov. 5: Sift through more than 20,000 documents obtained from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein … After six tedious days combing through the records, Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and four staff members identified three emails that would go on to ignite a political firestorm. In the emails, Epstein wrote that Trump had ‘spent hours’ at the late financier’s house with one of his victims and that he ‘knew about the girls.’”

Trump has denied any wrongdoing here, and there’s no evidence that he participated in Epstein’s trafficking operation.

TALK OF THE TOWN

OPEN THE DOORS — After months of closure while the East Wing was being demolished, White House tours will begin again tomorrow — just in time to see the new holiday decorations, which volunteers erected over the Thanksgiving long weekend. Journos are being invited in this morning for a sneak peak, but Fox News has already been given an early look.

The scoop they all wanted: Per Fox News, this year’s decorations include LEGO portraits of Donald Trump and George Washington, plus a gingerbread house made from “120 pounds of gingerbread dough, 100 pounds of pastillage dough, more than 10 pounds of chocolate, nearly 80 pounds of royal icing and five pounds of isomalt sugar.” Nobody tell RFK Jr.

BILL OF HEALTH — Trump told reporters he will release his October MRI, which the White House hasn’t yet provided details about. He said he had “no idea” what body part the MRI scan was focused on, but insisted it wasn’t his brain.

SPOTTED on Friday night on the patio at the president’s table at Mar-a-Lago: President Donald Trump, U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, Christopher Ruddy and Anthony and Lynda Lomangino.

Lawyers say thousands could benefit from the order, but it’s expected to be appealed.

U.S. District Judge Sunshine S. Sykes on Tuesday expanded an order from last week granting detained immigrants with no criminal history the opportunity to request a bond hearing. Now, instead of only impacting a few named in the California lawsuit, the decision will apply to immigrants held in detention nationwide.

It’s part of an ongoing lawsuit challenging changes the Trump administration made over the summer when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was revisiting its authority to detain people and would make noncitizens ineligible for bond hearings before an immigration judge.

Prior to the policy change, most noncitizens with no criminal record who were arrested away from the border had an opportunity to request such a hearing and if bond was granted remain free while their cases wound through immigration court.

Sykes issued an order on Thursday that found the new policy unlawful.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, released a statement Wednesday that pointed to a September decision from the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals allowing the new policy.

She said the previous policy “dangerously unleashed millions of unvetted illegal aliens into American communities—and they used many loopholes to do so.”

Her statement did not say whether Sykes’ decision would be appealed and the department did not respond to questions on the matter.

Tuesday’s decision could impact thousands of immigrants but not all. Those with criminal convictions or who have an expedited removal order would still not be allowed a bond hearing.

Matt Adams, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he has heard of immigration judges already advising some immigrants of their right to a bond hearing since Sykes’ orders were filed.

“These are people who’ve been living here in the United States, many for years, many for decades, who have U.S. citizen family members, who have no criminal history, who do not present any danger or threat of a flight risk, and yet they were being locked up without any possibility of being released during these lengthy proceedings,” Adams said.",https://nydailyrecord.com/files/2024/02/Depositphotos_643534474_L.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:36.378800

is among what immigration attorneys describe as an escalating trend: some immigrants who win protection from deportation to their home countries are being detained indefinitely.
An immigration judge recently denied Ngựa asylum but granted him protection under the anti-torture convention.
In an order granting F.B.’s release last month, U.S. district court judge Tanya Walton Pratt in Indiana said the government’s claim that F.B.","R.V. had already spent six months detained at a facility in California when he won his case in immigration court in June.

He testified that he had fled his native Cuba in 2024 after protesting against the government, for which he was jailed, surveilled and persecuted. So, after being kidnapped in Mexico, he entered the U.S. illegally and told border agents he was afraid for his life.

An immigration court judge granted him protection against deportation to Cuba, and R.V., 21, was looking forward to reuniting with family in Florida.

But R.V., who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation from the government, hasn’t been released. At the detention center, he said, agents have told him they’ll still find a way to deport him — if not to Cuba, then maybe Panama or Costa Rica.

“The wait is so hard,” he said in an interview. “It’s as if they don’t want to accept that I won.”

R.V. is among what immigration attorneys describe as an escalating trend: some immigrants who win protection from deportation to their home countries are being detained indefinitely.

Often, the person has been held while the federal government appealed their win or sought another country willing to take them in.

The government has long had the ability to make such appeals or to seek another country where it could deport someone; the Department of Homeland Security generally has 90 days to find somewhere else to send them.

But, in practice, such third-country removals were rare, so the person was typically released and allowed to remain in the U.S.

That practice has changed under the Trump administration. Recent instructions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel favor keeping people detained. A June 24 memo, for instance, states that “field offices no longer have the option to discretionarily release aliens.”

At issue are cases involving immigrants who, rather than winning asylum, are granted one of two kinds of immigration relief, known as orders of “withholding of removal” and protection under the international Convention Against Torture. Both have higher burdens of proof than asylum but don’t provide a pathway to citizenship.

These forms of relief differ from asylum in a key way: while asylum protects against deportation anywhere, the others only protect against deportation to a country where the person risks harm or torture.

Jennifer Norris, an attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said the government’s actions now effectively render withholding of removal and protection under the anti-torture convention meaningless.

“We have entered a dangerous era,” Norris, said. “These are clients who did everything right. They won their cases before an immigration judge and now they’re treated like criminals and remain in detention even after an immigration judge rules in their favor.”

Laura Lunn, advocacy and litigation director with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network in Colorado, noted that rules against double jeopardy do not apply in these cases, so the government has the ability to appeal when it loses.

“Here, they have so much control over whether someone remains detained because, if they just file an appeal, that person can just sit in detention for at least six months or what could be years,” Lunn said.

Homeland Security did not respond to specific questions and declined to comment.

Lawyers representing immigrants in prolonged detention say the government is keeping people locked up in hopes of wearing down their clients so they abandon their fight to remain in the U.S.

Ngựa, a Vietnamese man who asked to be identified by his family nickname, meaning horse, has been detained in California since he crossed the southern border illegally in March.

Ngựa fled Vietnam last year after being tortured by police officers who tried to extort him for a “protection tax,” according to his asylum application. When he refused, the officers beat and jailed him, and threatened to kill him and his family.

An immigration judge recently denied Ngựa asylum but granted him protection under the anti-torture convention. His pro bono lawyers have appealed the asylum denial.

In an interview through an interpreter, he said he chose to seek safety in the U.S. because he believed that the government of any other country would deport him back to Vietnam. He said he didn’t anticipate that U.S. officials would try to get rid of him.

Ngựa said ICE officers told him they know they can’t send him back to Vietnam, but will find another country willing to take him in. Every morning, he said, an officer goes from dormitory to dormitory asking whether anyone wants to self-deport.

The thought of being sent away keeps him up at night, but the alternative is nearly just as bad: “I’m afraid that I will be detained here for years,” he said.

DHS regulations allow continued detention when “there is a significant likelihood of removing a detained alien in the reasonably foreseeable future.”

Such scenarios are increasingly possible since a Supreme Court ruling in June broadened the ability for immigration authorities to quickly deport people to countries where they have no personal connection.

After the ruling, ICE released guidance directing agents to generally give migrants slated for removal to a third country “at least 24 hours” notice, but as little as six hours in “exigent circumstances.”

The guidance also said the U.S. needs to receive credible diplomatic assurances that the deported people will not be persecuted or tortured.

This year, the Trump administration has brokered deals with several countries, including Ghana, El Salvador, and South Sudan — which is on the brink of civil war — to accept deportees.

“It has just become more of a regular practice for the government to hold onto people who win protection because they are actively looking, in most cases, for a third country to accept them,” said Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.

Realmuto is one of the lead attorneys in the case challenging Homeland Security’s practice of third-country removals.

Federal law states that Homeland Security should first seek out alternative countries to which the person being deported has some personal connection, and then, if that’s “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible,” find a country whose government is willing to accept them.

Realmuto said the Trump administration is skipping straight to that last resort. As a result, she said, several people who were deported to a third country have been sent by officials there back to the country they originally fled.

Among them is Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old woman who fled Sierra Leone’s civil war 30 years ago and settled in Maryland until ICE agents detained her this summer during her annual check-in.

NBC News reported that because a judge had banned ICE from sending her back to Sierra Leone, where she had been tortured, the agency deported her to Ghana. But Ghanaian officials forcibly put her on a bus to Sierra Leone.

In fiscal year 2024, 2,506 people were granted withholding of removal or protection under the anti-torture convention, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Realmuto said that, like Kuyateh, tens of thousands of immigrants have been granted withholding or deferral relief over the course of several decades. Such people could now be at risk of being detained again while the government works to remove them to another country, she said.

The case of F.B., a 27-year-old Colombian woman who entered the U.S. at the San Ysidro port of entry in 2024, further illustrates the government’s approach toward the anti-torture convention. F.B. asked to be identified by her initials out of fear of retaliation by the U.S. government.

In February, F.B. won protection under the anti-torture convention. But instead of releasing her, Homeland Security said it was attempting to remove her to Honduras, Guatemala or Brazil.

In September, lawyers for F.B. filed a petition in federal court for her release.

“It’s kind of hard to argue somebody’s removal is imminent when they’ve been detained for eight months,” said her attorney, Kristen Coffey.

Court records show the judge initially denied the petition after ICE officials claimed they had booked a flight for her to Bolivia that would leave three days later.

But a month after that, she was still in U.S. custody.

In an order granting F.B.’s release last month, U.S. district court judge Tanya Walton Pratt in Indiana said the government’s claim that F.B. would be imminently deported had “proven false,” and that keeping her detained was “contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States.”

She was released the same day.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d1d3de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3309x1737+0+234/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2Fa4%2F1369ebdf41b1ae71b5e52946ead7%2F1440415-me-0425-asylum-app-rcg-1765.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:39.592631
,Agencies,2025-12-01 15:30:33+00:00,Los Angeles Times,L.A. County supervisors are set to ban masks worn by ICE agents. Can they win a battle with Trump?,"Melissa Gomez, www.latimes.com, melissa-gomez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-01/la-county-supervisors-ordinance-banning-masked-ice-agents-trump,"On Tuesday, L.A. County supervisors Janice Hahn and Lindsey P. Horvath will introduce the ordinance for a vote.
The ordinance would also require law enforcement officers, including local, state and federal, to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.
The masks and lack of identification have sowed fears the armed men could be people posing as law enforcement officers.
“This is how an authoritarian’s secret police operate — not legitimate law enforcement in a democracy,” she said.
“Sanctuary politicians attempting to ban our federal law enforcement from wearing masks is despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers,” she said in a statement.","Los Angeles County supervisors plan to vote soon on an ordinance that would prohibit law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, from wearing masks or disguising their identities while conducting operations in unincorporated L.A. County, probably setting up a legal battle with the Trump administration.

On Tuesday, L.A. County supervisors Janice Hahn and Lindsey P. Horvath will introduce the ordinance for a vote. The ordinance would also require law enforcement officers, including local, state and federal, to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.

Since immigration agents began raiding Los Angeles neighborhoods and worksites in June, many local leaders have pushed for action on the issue. Residents are concerned about the masked agents, often disguised with face coverings and masks. The masks and lack of identification have sowed fears the armed men could be people posing as law enforcement officers. Residents have called on sheriff’s deputies and police for help, only to be told that local agencies do not interfere with federal operations.

If the ordinance is approved, it will — per county policy — go again before supervisors for a second vote, scheduled for Dec. 9. It would then go into effect 30 days later. But legal experts have cast doubt that federal agents would be required to follow the ordinance, and federal officials have already issued a legal challenge to similar state-level legislation.

L.A. County counsel Dawyn R. Harrison told the supervisors the ordinance “would most likely be challenged on the supremacy clause,” which holds that federal law supersedes state and local law.

Hahn has acknowledged that the federal government will probably take action against the ordinance. Still, she said in a statement, she never thought she would see the day when a “masked, anonymous federal police force” would target people based on their skin color and spoken language and force people into unmarked vans at gunpoint.

Just last week, her office said, nine people were picked up by masked ICE agents at worksites across Long Beach. According to the Long Beach Post, ICE agents chased a gardener into a restaurant in front of Long Beach police officers. Hahn said that the ordinance is driven by repeated instances of L.A. County residents encountering plainclothes or masked agents who refuse to identify themselves or show ID.

“This is how an authoritarian’s secret police operate — not legitimate law enforcement in a democracy,” she said. “This is about our residents’ constitutional rights — and this ordinance is designed to protect them. So, if this means a fight with the federal government in the courts, I think it is a fight worth having.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has defended the tactic of agents wearing masks in order to protect their identities and keep them safe amid reported increased violence against federal officers. Previously, she stated that officers do verbally identify themselves, wear vests identifying their agency and use vehicles that include the name of the department, although agents are also often seen detaining people while wearing street clothing, without visible badges and driving unmarked cars.

McLaughlin said the administration will not abide by any attempt to ban masks.

“Sanctuary politicians attempting to ban our federal law enforcement from wearing masks is despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers,” she said in a statement.

Hahn, when asked if the board is considering alternatives if the ordinance fails to stand legal muster, said supervisors would “cross that bridge if we come to it.”

Since the immigration raids began on June 6 in Los Angeles through Aug. 26, the Department of Homeland Security has arrested at least 5,000 undocumented people in the county, the board’s Tuesday motion states, a number that has only gone up with the raids continuing. The motion states the ordinance would make exceptions for law enforcement officers wearing face coverings during undercover operations, as part of SWAT duties or for protection reasons.

“In an unprecedented moment when Los Angeles County’s immigrant communities are under attack, it is essential that the Board implement policies that cement its support for immigrants’ rights, and the rights of all people who may interact with law enforcement,” Hahn wrote in a motion for the ordinance. “It is reasonable to expect all officers — local, state, and federal — to comply with an ordinance that simply requires them to clearly show the public that they actually are law enforcement officers who are acting within the course of their duties.”

The California Legislature passed a similar bill that would require agents to identify themselves and prohibit on-duty officers from covering their faces.

After Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill, the federal government sued to stop it from taking effect.

Atty Gen. Pam Bondi made it clear the government would challenge any and all similar legislation, which she said is unconstitutional.

“California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,” Bondi said in a statement. “These laws cannot stand.”

During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals.
The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns.","A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia's immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group haspreviously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: ‘After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.’

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre,said: ‘Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.’

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: ‘JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.’

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: ‘Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.’

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: ‘This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.’

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: ‘Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.’

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: ‘Australia's system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people - some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people

When Thera asked how many companies were being targeted, the agent replied, “We are auditing all companies in Northern California.” Thera said the agent admitted it was his first such audit, suggesting the campaign is still ramping up.

The audits come amid wider federal pressure on California’s trucking sector:

FMCSA revoked 17,000 non-domiciled CDLs issued to foreign nationals earlier this month after finding the state failed to verify legal residency. Another 44,000 remain under review.

A reinstated English-language proficiency requirement for CDL holders has already pulled 7,248 drivers off the road since June.

ICE workplace enforcement actions in California rose sharply in 2025, with 77 Northern California trucking firms hit in the first half of the year alone.

Industry sources say many smaller Punjabi carriers still operate with 1099 independent contractors, a model that keeps costs competitive but leaves them exposed to both AB5 labor claims and now federal immigration audits.

Scale of the Punjabi Trucking Community in California

California is home to an estimated 50,000–74,000 Punjabi/Sikh truck drivers and owner-operators – roughly 40% of the state’s total long-haul driver pool.

Nationwide, the Punjabi/Sikh trucking community is estimated at 150,000–200,000 drivers and owners, controlling up to 20% of U.S. trucking companies despite representing only about 4–5% of the overall driver workforce.

The North American Punjabi Trucking Association (NAPTA) lists more than 1,400 member companies operating over 9,000 trucks, though this represents only a fraction of the total community.

ICE is currently working out of a building on Milwaukee School of Engineering’s campus, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.
There has been tremendous solidarity and outrage from the community over the construction of the 36,000 square foot facility in Milwaukee, according to Neumann-Ortiz.
Neumann-Ortiz said that by calling the ICE facility a processing center, it whitewashes and scales down the abuses that often occur in these facilities.
“It is about building a larger facility for processing,” Neumann-Ortiz said.","Construction of a new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility began on the north side of Milwaukee, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee. ICE is currently working out of a building on Milwaukee School of Engineering’s campus, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.

Community members, including organizations such as VOCES de la Frontera and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, protested outside the new building Nov. 15, according to Wisconsin Examiner. There has been concern about the lack of transparency and communication with local leaders by ICE, according to VOCES de la Frontera executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz.

“The position of the federal government has been that the local government doesn’t really have a voice in whether to move forward with this,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “In the current context, we’re witnessing an ICE and Customs and Border Patrol that has been profiling people, physically assaulting them for no reason and violating people’s due process in a myriad of ways.”

Neumann-Ortiz said the Trump administration’s “campaign of terror” is unwanted by communities as it is based on white supremacist ideas and is a misuse of tax dollars. She said the federal government is spending billions of dollars on this, while people go hungry and cannot access affordable housing and healthcare.

There has been tremendous solidarity and outrage from the community over the construction of the 36,000 square foot facility in Milwaukee, according to Neumann-Ortiz. ICE has been explicit that the facility is going to be expanded to hold more people for longer periods of time, she said.

“It’s been called the deadliest year in terms of ICE custody because they’re going after everybody, [including] seniors and people in our community who have health conditions,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “The conditions in which they’re [ICE] holding people are not good, and they’ve been notoriously not good, and we’ve seen an increase in death because of lack of medical care and suicide.”

Neumann-Ortiz said organizations and community members need to make sure this facility expansion does not take place through nonviolent activity and lobbying. VOCES de la Frontera is seeking policies that actually make the community better and support good immigration reform at the federal and state level, Neumann-Ortiz said.

Milwaukee is home to the largest population of immigrants in Wisconsin, and many are a part of mixed-status households, according to UW professor in the School for Workers Armando Ibarra. The expansion of this facility is perpetuating uncertainty for immigrants and individuals who come from immigrant households, Ibarra said.

“This idea that there was a facility that was going to be expanded in Milwaukee was announced in January of 2025, and even back then, there were elected officials and some organizations that were speaking up against this,” Ibarra said. “ICE used a federal exemption to avoid the city approval process, and they modified this building into this processing slash detaining center.”

There are many individuals on campus in precarious situations because the Trump administration has designated certain immigration statuses as less stable than in the past, according to Ibarra.

Ibarra said that there is increased uncertainty for international students, international professors on H-1B visas and individuals under DACA. Immigrants and individuals from mixed-status families are also at a heightened risk and experiencing a lot of fear, according to Ibarra.

Ibarra said many people are pushing back against what is happening with ICE expansion nationwide, namely in cities such as Chicago, Charlotte and Los Angeles. Some people who were not politically active in the past are now participating in these movements, according to Ibarra.

“They’re [protesters] protecting their neighbors, they’re protecting the community, they’re protecting their loved ones or [they have] just a sense of patriotism that is inclusive of their neighbors, loved ones and people that are positive members of their communities,” Ibarra said.

VOCES de la Frontera considers the Keeping Families Together and State Driver’s License bills as important areas of advocacy in Wisconsin, according to Neumann-Ortiz. Both of these are important pieces of legislation for holding ICE accountable, she said.

Neumann-Ortiz said that by calling the ICE facility a processing center, it whitewashes and scales down the abuses that often occur in these facilities. She said these facilities are essentially jail since they do not allow freedom of movement, and often lead to people being moved to other facilities and then deported.

“It is about building a larger facility for processing,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “It could mean we’re going to move you to another detention facility in another state, which is happening right now, where people are not able to access their attorneys or connect with family.”",https://badgerherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMGL4385-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:22.097085

Michael Vastine is a faculty member of the Stetson University College of Law and also serves as an Academic Advisory Board Member for the Acacia Center for Justice. A nationally recognized expert, leading litigator, and academic in the fields of immigration law and immigrant defense, he has also held numerous elected and appointed leadership at the national level of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and the AILA South Florida Chapter, including a term as Chair. Professor Vastine has litigated extensively before the U.S. Courts of Appeals, in cases arising from his clinical practice and primarily construing the “categorical approach” for determining the immigration consequences of crimes, including foundational cases on questions of mens rea elements, definitions of controlled substances, trafficking, firearms, and crimes involving moral turpitude. He also argued the Florida Supreme Court case establishing the post-Padilla v. Kentucky standard for effective criminal defense of immigrants. He has separately authored numerous amicus curiae briefs for AILA and other organizations in litigation of similar issues at the Courts of Appeals and, occasionally, before the U.S. Supreme Court, in addition to work challenging the constitutionality of the prolonged detention of immigrants.

This blog post is a crosspost with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, you can find their version of the post.

Following a recent court order, the U.S. government has resumed fully funding the “National Qualified Representative Program” (NQRP), a formal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) program which provides legal counsel to “certain detained immigrants deemed incompetent to represent themselves by an immigration judge.” Since 2013, the NQRP has improved due process for detained people with debilitating mental health conditions and has also, as a consequence, help to make the immigration courts run more efficiently. Despite these efficiencies, the program became one of the many ironic casualties of DOGE government cuts. A federal judge found the cessation of counsel to be “arbitrary and capricious,” further noting that the executive branch had conceded the point. With NQRP funding restored for only the next year, it is critical to understand the purpose and impact of the program, so it can be recognized and protected. This moment of reprieve also underscores the need for a more secure foundation for the program. At present, the program is only protected by court order and is reliant, entirely, on the opinions of the judiciary of the California District Courts to keep it alive. For the sake of its long-term sustainability, NQRP should also be written into legislation, enacted by state or federal-level Congressional representatives.

Fifteen years ago, for the first time, a judge ordered the federal government to provide representation for two detained immigrants in their removal cases before the immigration court. This step was unprecedented, because while immigrants have a right to be represented, unlike in the criminal court system, they don’t have a right to be provided an attorney at government expense. The two immigrants at issue presented such profound mental health conditions that it was impossible for them to represent themselves. I agreed to co-represent pro bono one of the two, a homeless refugee client whom the judge noted to present “very active and pronounced psychotic disorder, schizophrenia of the paranoid type ... frequent auditory hallucinations .... [and] psychosis … that prevented him from expressing himself”, a condition so serious that he had years earlier been voluntarily committed to a treatment facility. In this test case, we lost our client’s case for bond, with the immigration judge setting a bond amount that was prohibitively high, given his life circumstances.

These cases affirmed that attorneys’ management of these cases and advocacy for their vulnerable clients – presenting evidence, expert materials, testimony, and argument - is helpful for delivering justice. It is also very helpful for the cost management of these cases. Why?: 1) Detaining people is expensive (at least $152 daily, per detainee), but detaining mentally ill immigrants is very expensive; and 2) court cases (which sometimes can languish for years, even in the detained setting) move much faster in the hands of a defense attorney than when a mentally ill immigrant attempts to represent themself. I took the case because I thought it was valuable to see if a system of appointed attorneys might help, even if the pro bono model was unsustainable over the long term. Through our advocacy, the client did not immediately win his freedom, but his case was part of an important moment.

Soon thereafter, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued the first in a line of rulings explaining standards and safeguards for immigration court cases of immigrants with severe mental health conditions. The BIA rulings were limited victories for immigrants and largely procedural. The factual basis for a non-citizen’s removal often is simple to prove (e.g. they lack a visa, overstayed their authorized time in the U.S., or committed a removable offense), but the court had to first affirm the noncitizen’s understanding of the purpose of the proceedings, and take steps to facilitate the case, often in the form of permitting a “friend of the court” (a non-attorney relative, friend, caretaker) to actively participate and engage with the judge. Cases for “relief” from removal were much more complicated, as incompetent non-citizens faced inevitable challenges in proving that they merited favorable discretion or faced likely future persecution in their country of origin if removed. Without assistance of defense counsel, immigrants’ legal outcomes were daunting. As well, judges, already faced with crushing case backlogs, can’t shoulder the responsibility of facilitating fair hearings without investing an inordinate amount of time, themselves, in exploring the cases of immigrants who cannot effectively communicate these case details to the court.

Thus, the government, during the Obama administration, realized that investing in due process provided tangible returns and made the NQRP part of formal DHS and DOJ policy. The caseload of the NQRP is modest in real numbers amounting to just over two thousand cases over the last twelve years. Less than 900 of these cases were open at the time funding was cut in early 2025. Nevertheless, each represented case was a realization of the American promise of a system of laws and due process.

Year one of the second Trump administration is a remarkable time for the United States which, until recently, proudly proclaimed itself a nation of immigrants. By the narrowest of margins, Congress recently authorized a spending increase for immigration detention and enforcement that would add up to more than 1 trillion dollars over a period of ten years. This massive increase in spending has been justified under the pretext of countering criminality, despite the bevy of academic research showing that there’s no connection between immigration and crime rates. Moreover, immigrants who do commit crimes are already subject to removal and most are subject to mandatory detention under existing laws. The Supreme Court is permitting this enforcement to include removal of immigrants to harsh, dangerous foreign prisons or war-torn places to which they have no ties.

Against this factual backdrop, the accompanying rhetoric, and military on the city streets of our heretofore free society, it is perhaps quaint to invoke principles, even those enshrined in the constitution, but due process matters, even – especially – for unpopular groups and even more so for vulnerable ones such as the mentally disabled. Due process ensures that the awesome power of justice is meted out appropriately, including the power of a country to remove a person from its territory. In this context, principle converges with practicality, as investment in representation produces efficiency.

The recent court order rejected the arbitrary way in which NQRP met its demise. The administration has, thus far, complied with the court’s order to continue fully funding NQRP, through its major stakeholders, who have an established track record of implementing services for the target recipients nationwide. There was no financial reason not to pursue the principled path. Now that it is restored, funding for the National Qualified Representative Program must be permanently protected, and Congress should move to enact legislation on its behalf.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/meta_open_graph/public/2025-12/tingey-injury-law-firm-ycdpu73kgsc-unsplash.jpg?itok=PQcXf16B,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:44.534844

Trump 'wouldn't have wanted' second strike on Caribbean boat

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One yesterday, the president defended Hegseth, saying he believed his statement “100%” that he hadn’t ordered the second strike.

“I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

When asked if he would have wanted a second attempt to kill the survivors, the president said:

We’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.”

The Washington Post reported that Hegseth “gave a spoken directive” to “kill everybody” on board in September. When there were still two men left after the first strike, a Special Operations commander ordered the follow-up to comply with Hegseth’s direction, the newspaper reported.

Hegseth has strongly denied the report, calling it “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”.

He also said the US’s strikes on boats so far in the Caribbean had been “lawful under both US and international law”.

As Pete Hegseth continues to face scrutiny following a Washington Post report that he “gave a spoken directive” on 2 September to “kill everybody” on board in a second strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel, the defense secretary appeared glib on social media.

He posted a picture on Sunday evening, which shows a parody cover of a Franklin the Turtle book, where the beloved character is shooting small boats below him filled with men transporting drugs. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth captioned the illustration.

The defense secretary continues to deny the Post’s claims. “As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland,” he wrote in a statement on Friday.

Trump backs GOP candidate in Tennessee special election as race tightens

Over the weekend, the president threw his weight behind Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate in the special election in Tennessee’s seventh congressional district. Van Epps is running against Aftyn Behn – a Democratic state representative – to replace former GOP congressman Mark Green. A reminder, that Trump carried the district by 22 points in 2024, but after the success of November’s elections for Democrats across the country, the party is hoping to flip the Maga stronghold.

“HE WILL BE A GREAT CONGRESSMAN,” Trump said of Van Epps on Truth Social, adding that while he “cherishes Christianity and Country Music”, his opponent “hates them both”. This comes after Republicans have criticized Behn for resurfaced comments on a 2020 podcast. “I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music,” she said of Nashville, which is part of the district she’s running to represent.

My colleague, Chris Stein, reports that a survey from Emerson College Polling and the Hill found Van Epps up by just two percentage points over Behn, leading with 48% support to her 46%. He adds that the district is mostly made up of the sort of rural territory in which Democrats have struggled to compete, but also includes part of blue-leaning Nashville, as well as the city of Clarksville, a swing area whose residents may well decide the race.

Trump continues to lambast Democratic lawmakers over troops video

The president has picked up where he left off before Thanksgiving, when it comes to his anger at the six Democratic lawmakers who took part in a video urging service members to “refuse illegal orders”.

A reminder, that Trump initially went on a Truth Social tirade, accusing the members of Congress (all of whom are veterans or former intelligence officials) of sedition, adding that their actions are “punishable by death”.

In the early hours of Monday morning (12:45am ET to be precise) Trump recounted the US Code, including a section which calls for the fine or imprisonment, for up to 10 years, for those who “interfere, impair, influence the loyalty, moral or discipline of the military and naval forces”.

“DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE!!!,” Trump concluded on social media today.

Trump's envoys Witkoff and Kushner to meet with Putin in Moscow

Donald Trump’s top envoy, Steve Witkoff, is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. He’ll be joined by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been integral in the ongoing negotiations with Russia. This comes after a Bloomberg report from last week included a leaked transcript between Witkoff and a senior Moscow official, about how Russia could curry favor with Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, in Paris, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and France’s president Emanuel Macron met today.

“Peace must become truly durable. The war must end as soon as possible. Much now depends on the involvement of every leader,” Zelenksyy wrote on social media following their closed-door discussion. “We will also be speaking with other leaders today,” he added.

Trump invites families of national guard members shot in DC to the White House

After two members of the West Virginia national guard were shot in DC last week, the president has invited their families to the White House.

One soldier, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the attack –which took place the day before Thanksgiving. Her fellow service member, US air force staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Vigils across West Virginia have taken place in their memory.

“I said: ‘When you’re ready, because that’s a tough thing, come to the White House. We’re going to honor Sarah,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. “And likewise with Andrew, recover or not.”

My colleague, Marina Dunbar, reports that mourners came together over the weekend at Webster County high school in West Virginia to honor Beckstrom. Both she and Wolfe had been serving with the West Virginia national guard as part of Trump’s federal initiative to support policing efforts in DC.

Venezuela called the strikes 'murder'

Venezuela’s National Assembly has accused the US of committing “murder” with the strikes. It is one of the first acknowledgements by Venezuelan officials that their citizens have been targeted.

“There’s no declared war [between the US and Venezuela)] therefore this cannot be classified as anything but murder,” Jorge Rodriguez, the National Assembly president, told a press conference on Sunday.

“Every human being has the right to due process; no human being can be killed in a brutal manner.”

Senator Mark Kelly: “We’re going to have a public hearing. We’re going to put these folks under oath. And we’re going to find out what happened. And then, there needs to be accountability.”

He also told CNN: “If what has been reported is accurate, I have got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over.”

Senator Chris Van Hollen: “I think it’s very possible there was a war crime committed.”

And a quick reminder of the background to US strikes in these waters:

Since September, the US has expanded its naval presence in the region, carrying out strikes on what it says are drug-smuggling boats in waters off Venezuela and Colombia.

More than 80 people have been killed according to the US Defence Department.

The US has said it is destroying boats bringing in harmful drugs, and thus its attacks are launched out of self-defence – a legal justification for military attacks under international laws of armed conflict.

But it has provided scant evidence of the alleged criminality of the boats, and has also declined to provide identification details of the people it has killed on board the boats.

Venezuela’s National Assembly has accused the US of committing “murder” with the strikes.

The UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk has said there’s “strong evidence” such strikes constitute extrajudicial killings. He’s been calling for Congress investigate.

The reports then from the weekend add another layer of suspected illegality. The Washington Post reports that the US navy on 2 September struck a drug-running vessel, killing some of the 11 on board in the first strike. After commanders saw on the live drone feed that there were still two survivors clinging to the wreck, they executed an order to strike again, to kill all those on board.

Follow-up strikes are forbidden under the rules of war and engagement, i.e. what is legal fighting between parties in a conflict.

Clauses in the the Geneva Conventions also forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be shielded, rescued and if applicable, treated as prisoners of war with relevant rights.

Republican-led committees launching investigations

There’s been a swift response from lawmakers following the reports. Republican-led committees overseeing the Pentagon have vowed to conduct “vigorous oversight” into the boat strikes.

Senate Armed Services Committee:“Has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances”.

House Armed Services Committee: “Is taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question”.

And lawmakers on both sides, speaking on talk shows on Sunday, called for congressional review.

“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Democrat Senator Tim Kaine on CBS’s Face the Nation programme.

Republican lawmaker Mike Turner said Congress did not know yet if the report of the follow-up strike was true.

“Obviously if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” said Turner, a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee.

Trump 'wouldn't have wanted' second strike on Caribbean boat

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One yesterday, the president defended Hegseth, saying he believed his statement “100%” that he hadn’t ordered the second strike.

“I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

When asked if he would have wanted a second attempt to kill the survivors, the president said:

We’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.”

The Washington Post reported that Hegseth “gave a spoken directive” to “kill everybody” on board in September. When there were still two men left after the first strike, a Special Operations commander ordered the follow-up to comply with Hegseth’s direction, the newspaper reported.

Hegseth has strongly denied the report, calling it “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”.

He also said the US’s strikes on boats so far in the Caribbean had been “lawful under both US and international law”.

What Padilla v. Kentucky eventually mandated was already taking shape inside LA County’s public defender’s office.","A few weeks ago, Giselle said, her friend had been driving an intoxicated friend home late at night.

“That person left an open can in her back seat, and she didn’t realize it,” she said. “Police pulled her over for no reason and called it a DUI without even doing the tests.”

Charges were dropped and her friend was released from jail, Giselle said, but she didn’t get to go home.

“ICE was waiting,” said Giselle, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of reprisal from federal authorities. “Now she’s in Mexico, and her husband and kids are all here.”

For immigrants who get caught up in the criminal justice system, the conclusion of their case doesn’t necessarily mean their ordeal is over. Instead, in LA County, as with many other places in the country, some have been subject to continued detention and a trip to immigration court, where the Public Defender office can no longer help them with their case.

That last part, however, is about to change.

For the first time in its 111-year history, the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office will be able to represent people in immigration court. A new unit will screen individuals for immigration representation, offer guidance and referrals and, for those who qualify, provide direct legal defense in immigration proceedings through in-house immigration attorneys.

Between 2010 and 2014, more than 18,500 people — many of whom had already completed their sentences — were held past their release dates because they had immigration detainers. These detainers are requests from ICE asking local jails to keep someone in custody longer than the law allows so federal agents can take them into immigration custody.

In 2012, that system was challenged in a lawsuit known as Roy v. County of Los Angeles, arguing that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD), which oversees the county jails, violated both state law and the Fourth Amendment by detaining people solely on the basis of an ICE request, without a warrant or probable cause of a crime.

The county eventually settled the case. As part of the agreement, LASD officials were forced to rewrite their policies so that immigration detainers could no longer justify extended detentions. The county also agreed to pay $14 million to those who had been unlawfully held.

Roy v. County of Los Angeles ultimately defined three groups of people harmed by the policy: immigrants who were held past their lawful release dates solely because of an ICE detainer, those who would have been released on bail but were kept in custody because of an immigration hold and immigrants who were denied bail altogether.

But many of the victims entitled to compensation could not be found. The unclaimed funds, called cy pres funds, cannot be returned to the agency responsible for the harm; instead, they must support work that benefits similarly affected communities.

Now, according to Los Angeles County Assistant Public Defender Graciela Martinez, those funds are financing the new removal defense unit within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office — one that operates outside the office’s traditional criminal practice. The unit will take on federal deportation cases, a space public defenders normally do not enter under current law. The distinction matters: the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to counsel only in criminal proceedings, leaving immigrants in civil immigration court without a government-appointed attorney.

While representation is a significant part of the new effort, according to Martinez, the unit’s responsibilities extend beyond it. Community members will be screened to determine whether they qualify for full legal defense, and even those who do not will receive guidance, referrals, and information about their options. The office is also still navigating whether any portion of the cy pres funds can be used to pay immigration bonds for people detained in ICE facilities.

“The public defender’s office is a crucial backstop. If there were more funding, more fellows could be out there doing this work,” said Ingrid Eagly, co-director of UCLA Law School’s Criminal Law and Policy Consortium.

LA Public Press requested an interview with the inaugural fellow, Niki Nguyễn, through both UCLA Law and the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office. UCLA Law directed questions to the Public Defender’s Office, which confirmed that Nguyễn would not be available for an interview before publication.

For Martinez — a 31-year veteran attorney who helped drive the Roy litigation — the unit marks a kind of institutional reckoning. “The leftover cy pres funds allow us to serve people like them — people who were impacted but cannot be identified,” she said. “This is about looking at people as individuals — not as criminals, not as monsters.”

The path to this moment began well before the landmark 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky, which required defense attorneys nationwide to warn clients when a criminal case could affect their immigration status. “We didn’t even call ourselves ‘crimmigration’ people back then, but now we do,” said Martinez, who is also the first Latina and first foreign-born individual to lead the California Public Defender’s Association (CPDA).

The term crimmigration refers to the increasingly inseparable intersection of criminal law and immigration law. In this space, a single arrest, charge, or conviction can trigger life-altering immigration consequences far beyond the criminal courtroom.

What Padilla v. Kentucky eventually mandated was already taking shape inside LA County’s public defender’s office. Martinez said she had already been warning clients that a plea could trigger deportation or other immigration consequences since 2002, eight years before Padilla. She said she was mentored by Katherine Brady, an attorney widely regarded as a pioneer of “crimmigration.” Together, they helped create some of the earliest training materials still used by public defenders nationwide.

Despite that groundwork, enforcement often advanced more rapidly than safeguards. At one point, Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the nation, was holding more immigrants on ICE detainers than any other county in the nation — more than most states, according to the ACLU. Whether that volume reflects the county’s sheer size remains unclear. Martinez recalls that during the years covered by Roy v. County of Los Angeles (2010-2014), she repeatedly called jail staff to insist that clients be released, reminding them there was no legal basis to keep anyone in custody. “And still,” she said, “they would hold people until ICE arrived.”

An uneven landscape

As the new removal-defense team takes shape, its arrival also exposes the uneven terrain of public defense across California. The state’s 58 counties operate independently, with varying levels of funding, political will and willingness to address immigration consequences. “There are counties that are very anti-immigrant, and they’re not going to fight for this,” said Christopher Punongbayan, the executive director of California ChangeLawyers, a statewide foundation that funds early-career lawyers and advocates, with a focus on expanding access to justice for marginalized communities. “We look at where the need is.”

In Ventura County, more than 100,000 people commute to and from Los Angeles each day, moving between jurisdictions with vastly different levels of immigrant legal protection — differences that became especially visible this summer. In August, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors declined to expand its immigrant legal defense program, leaving a gap that city leaders in Oxnard chose to fill themselves. In response, the Oxnard City Council approved up to $600,000 in matching funds over three years to support an additional Ventura County public defender — a commitment that will take effect only if the county agrees to participate.

Ken Rozell, the city’s chief assistant attorney, said the proposal is intended to bolster support for the immigrant community, though the specifics are still being worked out. “We don’t dictate how the Public Defender’s Office would use that position,” Rozell said. “But it’s really to provide funding so they can assist in the way that the public defender can assist with those immigration issues.” LA Public Press has reached out to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors for comment and to ask about a timeline for a decision but had not received a response by publication.

“This is about due process,” Oxnard City Manager Alexander Nguyen said in a recorded livestream. For local organizers and families, the decision underscored their argument that cities can act even when counties refuse.

That local momentum reflects a broader shift across California. At the state level, data from the California Immigrant Policy Center shows that it was largely during the first Trump administration—amid an escalation in federal immigration enforcement—that California significantly strengthened its immigrant legal-defense infrastructure. That effort deepened with the 2019 Budget Act, which created the state’s first immigration legal fellowship to expand the pipeline of removal-defense attorneys in regions that need them most.

Even with new state funding, the gap between enforcement and representation remains stark. Los Angeles County’s removal-defense unit is a meaningful step, but it enters a system where demand far exceeds capacity. According to the Vera Institute, of the more than 450,000 people ordered removed in immigration court over the past 12 months, roughly 75 percent had no legal representation.

The reality behind those numbers is visible in daily life. Immigration arrests continue in homes, parking lots and near schools, fueling constant demand for legal help and straining volunteer-run hotlines. And across California — including its most progressive regions — many immigrants still appear in court without a lawyer. The State Bar of California reports that even with recent investments, including an additional $25 million in the 2025 budget, available resources fall well short of rising need.

For Giselle, those systemic failures were etched into her daily life.

“Our biggest crime is being brown,” Giselle said. Beside her, her friend Jessica nodded in agreement. For both women, their immigration status compounds the risks they already face.

Jessica said the strain of daily life had become its own barometer of inequity. Because she and her family are all vulnerable to immigration enforcement, she often feels pressure to shoulder more — a calculation shaped, she said, by her lighter skin and the belief that she is less likely to be singled out in a system where racial profiling by ICE has been repeatedly reported. “I’m working two jobs right now because I have to provide for my family,” she said. “I’m light-skinned, and even though I don’t look Mexican, I am.”

The removal-defense unit is unlikely to mend every fracture in the system. But it signals a turning point: for the first time Los Angeles County has embedded immigration attorneys within its own public defender’s office to defend clients in immigration court, reshaping a system that once funneled people directly from local jails into deportation proceedings.

“This is a critical moment — immigrants are being arrested every day by federal agents who show up in masks, without warrants, and engaging in profiling based on race,” said Eagly.","https://cdn.lapublicpress.org/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC03525-2.jpg",N,,2025-12-01 11:58:48.305282

Shooting of US National Guard

The move comes at a time of heightened tension in the US following a deadly shooting of two National Guard members, one of whom has succumbed to their injuries and died. In response, US President Donald Trump vowed to freeze migration from what he referred to as ""third-world countries"".

In a post on X, US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow confirmed the suspension.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who is the main suspect in the shooting, was wounded during the encounter with security forces. Lakanwal was reported to have worked with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for over a decade while living in Afghanistan.

After the Taliban takeover in 2021 and the withdrawal of US troops, Lakanwal came to the US with his family. According to media reports, Lakanwal had a hard time integrating into the US societal fabric and may have been dealing with PTSD.

Rejection of outside interference

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz publicly rejected what he described as US pressure on European migration policy, saying, ""Migration policy is our business, and we decide it as we see fit… We don't need any admonitions from outside.""

Germany, under a federal admissions program, offers Afghan nationals who had served in German offices or missions before the takeover of the Taliban settlement in Germany, along with their families. After suspension and much debate, the government resumed admissions for some Afghans with legally binding entry approvals.

The Chancellor added that Germany, together with the other EU countries, is in the process of forging a common European asylum and immigration policy, and insisted that these decisions should be made internally, without outside interference.

Merz’s response points to a broader concern among some EU leaders that foreign pressure, especially from the US, could complicate efforts to manage migration in a way that balances security, legal obligations, and humanitarian commitments.

Migrants implicated in crime

The public perception of migrants involved in crime, especially violent and sexual crimes, remains controversial and often misleading.

High-profile cases, such as a case that involved an asylum seeker in the UK embroiled in sexual assault, sparked riots in different parts of the country while fueling debate over whether migrants have a greater propensity to commit sexual or violent crimes.

Media coverage also tends to overrepresent crimes committed by foreigners relative to their actual share of offenders in police data.

Research shows that although foreigners may appear disproportionately in some crime statistics, once factors such as urban concentration, younger age profile, and socioeconomic conditions are accounted for, there is no clear causal relationship between migrants’ presence and higher crime rates.

Official statistics from the general population show rising sexual-offence figures overall, but not a conclusively disproportionate share can be attributed directly to migrant groups.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/6b2f41b0ae60dfe4a1ec2e5b652103554174708e.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:18.577037

She is sore. She is tired. And she is alone.

Oscarina and her husband escaped violence in Venezuela and moved 2,000 miles north to Missouri in 2023, seeking more stable housing and a better future for their daughter. Neither have permanent legal status in the United States, and when she learned she had a second child on the way, Oscarina wondered how they could afford to raise another baby.

Eight weeks into the pregnancy, her husband was detained while delivering a DoorDash order. He was deported back to Venezuela a short time later.

“All my pregnancy, I cried every single day,” Oscarina, who lives in Kansas City and asked not to use her name out of fear of deportation, told The Independent through an interpreter.

When she went into labor prematurely earlier this month, her husband cried as he called in over video from Venezuela.

When their daughter was born, he helped with night feedings. This time, there is no help. And what little money her family had saved up quickly disappeared during the deportation process.

Now she lives in constant fear about what would happen if she gets detained.

There are days her oldest child doesn’t attend school because Oscarina worries she could be taken while walking her to the bus stop.

She wonders what the point of the “American Dream” is. Her family suffered under Venezuela’s dictatorship, and in America she suffers, too.

“I would like to go back to my country,” Oscarina said. “But my husband is saying that things are very bad there right now, and I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring both of the kids right now.”

So they will remain separated.

“I live in fear every day,” Oscarina said. “ … It’s too heavy to carry being by myself with my daughter and my little boy and not having my husband because he will always care for us. The fact that he doesn’t get to be with us, everything changed for us.”

Oscarina’s story is one of many shared with The Independent over the past month as women who are undocumented in Missouri navigate pregnancy, birth and postpartum without legal paperwork.

Several community health care workers, doulas and nonprofits that work with immigrants and expectant mothers shared the struggles the families face. Few were willing to speak on the record, fearful that federal agents could target their offices or the federal government could restrict funding if they spoke out about their work with undocumented immigrants.

The organizations located across Missouri shared stories of pregnant and postpartum women who’ve shuttered themselves in their homes. Many are facing labor or postpartum in isolation, their husbands deported and the fear of the same fate keeping them housebound, at times too afraid to seek medical care.

Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been increasingly visible on America’s streets, including in Missouri, sparking protests across the state and nation. Arrests have made headlines as videos circulate of ICE agents detaining parents at school drop-offs and arresting teachers, including inside a preschool.

In rare cases, ICE has reportedly posted up outside maternity wards.

Under previous administrations, schools, hospitals and churches were considered sanctuary spaces where ICE was not allowed under almost any circumstances. That changed this year, raising new fears for families with young children like Oscarina.

“This is the worst that I’ve seen in many, many years,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project.

Under former President Joe Biden’s administration, pregnant women were protected from ICE detention. While that policy remains in place, the ACLU earlier this year uncovered several examples of women who were either pregnant or miscarried while in federal detention centers.

“The trauma it has on children and parents and families is heartbreaking,” Cho said. “And it’s completely unnecessary. These are families that have been living and working and contributing to our communities, often for years or decades.”

ICE threats send mothers, children into hiding in Missouri

Neysha Reyes Cruz is one of a handful of bilingual doulas in Missouri.

Through her company, Olas de Amor Doula Services, she has advocated for almost 90 women through pregnancy, birth and postpartum over the past three years. Of those 90, about 70 were undocumented, she said. This year, she estimates she’s stood in as the support person for about half a dozen women who gave birth after a close family member was deported.

Reyes Cruz, who is from Puerto Rico and moved to Missouri in 2016, often serves as an interpreter as well as a doula for her clients, the majority of whom give birth in hospitals. But in recent months, as the threat of ICE raids permeates her Kansas City community, she said her job has increasingly expanded into helping families with more than birth.

The messages she gets from moms are often desperate. One recently asked Reyes Cruz if she could get her formula from the store after the mother said she saw ICE agents out on her street that day.

Many of her clients skip non-crucial doctor’s appointments. Others miss WIC appointments or have been cut off from food stamps. She has a donation closet to help with clothing and baby supplies.

Instead of going to the pediatrician, many new moms instead call Reyes Cruz to ask if their baby is sick enough to warrant risking leaving the house. The child birth class she used to host in-person is now virtual because too many families feared driving to her.

“I have had moms that have withdrawn their kids from school and have just left the country so those kids never ended their school year. Mamas that were in situations where their partners became so depressed and anxious they started becoming abusive, and from there, having to find refuge for them,” she said. “This is the hardest thing, finding a refuge for a mama that is single, is pregnant or with maybe older kids, does not speak English and doesn’t have a prior family here.”

She encourages her clients to designate someone who is a citizen to get custody of their baby if they’re deported. One mom requested that Reyes Cruz be that person for her baby girl.

“As a doula, I’m being pushed to support this community because they don’t feel safe with anyone else,” she said.

She fears the elevated stress thrust on these families is affecting their babies. Of the past 10 births she’s attended, five were babies born prematurely.

Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Reyes Cruz’s experiences aren’t unique.

A health care provider in the Ozarks who was too afraid to speak on the record said she has Hispanic patients who fear coming into the clinic amid increasingly visible ICE raids around the country.

Other nonprofit workers shared the difficulties of helping parents obtain birth certificates for their newborn children so they could self-deport back to their home country. Legal aid groups help parents establish custody plans in case they are detained and their children are left alone.

Community health workers in urban centers of the state said they are doing more home health visits for pregnant and postpartum women who fear leaving the house, or who are waiting until later in pregnancy to see their doctors. Others help arrange Uber rides to get the women to their appointments.

“I’m heartbroken for any woman who feels fearful to leave her home, especially to try to receive prenatal care,” said Laura Brandt, director of Pregnancy Help Center of South County in St. Louis.

She said her nonprofit serves anyone who walks through the door and doesn’t question their status.

“This is such a polarizing topic and people have a lot of really strong opinions going either way on the matter,” Brandt said. “Regardless of what your opinions are on a policy level, on a personal level, every human being is deserving of dignity and compassion and care.”

Some families turn to self-deportation

In just a couple days, Monica is self-deporting. She purchased a one-way flight from Kansas City back to Chile, where she is from. Her 6-month-old son will be on her lap.

Monica, who asked not to use her name because she is undocumented, moved to the United States on Mother’s Day last year, seeking better education opportunities for her son, who is 8.

She learned she was pregnant a couple months later. She was sad to be experiencing a new life without her friends and family by her side.

When she was less than two weeks postpartum, Monica said her husband became violent during an argument. She called her therapist, who reported the abuse to the police. He was arrested and deported back to his home country of Venezuela.

Now alone, Monica can no longer afford to care for her two children on her own. She delivers for DoorDash, and on each trip she fears being caught by immigration agents. Her fear is amplified now that she has a second child. What happens to them if she’s detained?

“Life got more difficult for me,” she said through an interpreter as her son babbled from his perch on her hip.

Tim Rudolph, a St. Louis-based immigration attorney for Hacking Immigration Law, said it’s not uncommon for people to self-deport in today’s political climate.

He encouraged anyone considering self-deportation to talk with a lawyer first, noting that if someone has a child who is a U.S. citizen, they may have some legal paths to staying in the country if they want to stay.

“Even though the government is saying ‘if you leave you can come back the right way, we’ll let you do it,’ that’s not often the case,” Rudolph said. “That tends to be what they say to get people out of the country, and a lot of times you’ll be barred from returning.”

While Monica doesn’t yet know if she’ll ever try returning to the U.S., her current vision of her children’s future has been shattered. While she still believes the move to America was worthwhile to attempt to give her children a more promising future, she feels some relief to return home to her parents and to leave the constant fear of deportation behind.

“People need to be strong emotionally to come over to the United States,” Monica said. “Because even though the United States is a very great country full of opportunities, it can be very emotionally draining to be here with this situation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193563646-2048x1368.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 10:59:03.689184

A rapidly shifting landscape of humanitarian protections presents ongoing compliance challenges for employers. As the latest example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nationals of Haiti, Burma (Myanmar), and South Sudan while a federal court has temporarily blocked the termination of TPS for Syria.

TPS Terminations: Haiti, Burma (Myanmar), South Sudan

Haiti

Back in July, we covered litigation developments from a US District Court decision that extended TPS for Haiti until February 2026.

On November 26, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for Haiti. At the time of writing, the official Federal Register has not been published yet, but the termination is set to take effect on February 3, 2026. The termination will affect around 330,000 nationals from Haiti.

Burma (Myanmar)

On November 25, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for Burma. The termination will take effect on January 26, 2026, and will affect nearly 4,000 nationals from Burma who were granted TPS after the military coup in 2021.

South Sudan

On November 5, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for South Sudan. The termination will take effect on January 5, 2026.

Possible Termination of Somalia

On November 21, 2025, President Trump announced that he intends to end TPS for Somalia. At the time of writing, no official notice from DHS has been released. We will continue to monitor for official updates from DHS.

Please reference the table below to track the upcoming work authorization expiration dates for each TPS-designated country:

Country Date Work Authorization Expires South Sudan January 5, 2026 Burma (Myanmar) January 26, 2026 Haiti February 3, 2026

Litigation Halts Termination: Syria

Back in October, we covered the announcement of the termination of TPS for nationals from Syria. The Federal Register notice scheduled the termination to take effect on November 21, 2025, citing national security concerns as the basis for the decision. The decision would have affected nearly 4,000 Syrian nationals. However, on November 19, 2025, a judge in the Southern District of New York issued an order staying the termination of Syria TPS. We will update as the litigation develops.

Employer Considerations

Employers should be aware that affected TPS holders will lose both protected status and their work authorization unless they have transitioned to another lawful immigration status. This could result in the loss of employees who rely on TPS-based work authorization.

Employer Next Steps

Continued Form I-9 Compliance: Employees with TPS may have Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) that expire when their TPS ends. Employers should review and track card expiration dates for the TPS (A12 or C19) designations, follow reverification procedures, and closely monitor updates from DHS.

ICE I-9 Inspections: Employers may face increased scrutiny from Immigration and Customs Enforcement during I-9 inspections if their records are not updated timely, or if individuals without valid work authorization maintain employment.

Ongoing Communication: Employers should be prepared to address questions from affected employees and provide resources for legal counsel.

Stay Informed: Monitor updates from DHS and follow our blog for updates.

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, I hope you’ll consider becoming one—and upgrading to a paid subscription if your circumstances permit:

I wanted to use today’s “Long Read” to write about an issue that, at least in my universe, hasn’t gotten a lot of public attention—but that may well be one of the more quietly important legal stories of the year: The role federal district courts are playing in pushing back against a massively significant change to immigration detention policy that the Trump administration quietly attempted to implement back in July.

In a nutshell, the executive branch has radically expanded its interpretation of which non-citizens can be arrested and detained without bond pending their removal proceedings—a move that has exposed hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of individuals already living inside the United States to immigration arrest and detention to which they would not realistically have been subject prior to this summer, and with no right to seek release once they’ve been arrested. Many of those arrests have taken place at ICE facilities or courthouses when these same individuals have appeared for regular check-ins or for the next steps in their asylum applications. But regardless of where these arrests are taking place, it’s safe to say that this quiet attempt to expand what’s often shorthanded, however inaccurately, as “mandatory detention” is directly connected to many of the arrests we’re seeing during ICE raids in U.S. cities.

The Trump administration’s new interpretation of a 29-year-old statute, in turn, has been rejected by a truly staggering array of federal district courts across the country. According to Politico’s Kyle Cheney, since July,

At least 225 judges have ruled in more than 700 cases that the administration’s new policy, which also deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court, is a likely violation of law and the right to due process. Those judges were appointed by all modern presidents—including 23 by Trump himself—and hail from at least 35 states . . . . In contrast, only eight judges nationwide, including six appointed by Trump, have sided with the administration’s new mass detention policy.

What is striking about this pattern is not just its volume or the scorecard; it’s that the judges in many of these cases are writing thorough, persuasive opinions explaining why the Trump administration is utterly wrong on the law—including an especially strident ruling from Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York just last Wednesday. Kaplan appended to his 33-page decision a list of more than 350 of additional rulings by his district court colleagues. And although the litigation has proceeded at a retail, case-by-case level to date (hence the high number of cases), last Tuesday, Judge Sunshine Sykes in the Central District of California certified a nationwide class action at least for purposes of declaratory relief against the policy—which may accelerate how quickly this issue moves to the courts of appeals and, inevitably it seems, to the Supreme Court.

I’ve written before about the role federal district courts have played in issuing coercive relief against Trump administration policies over the past 10 months. These cases have not been part of the dataset my research assistants and I have maintained because they have been, to date, individual requests for release from detention rather than lawsuits seeking coercive relief against the policies themselves. But excepting changes to federal criminal sentencing laws, I can’t recall any other example of a federal policy that provoked quite so much litigation in such a short period of time—or litigation in which so many judges from across the geographical and ideological spectrum so overwhelmingly rejected the executive branch’s new interpretation of the relevant statutes. It’s a striking story not just about the Trump administration’s zealotry when it comes to immigration policy, but about the critical role hundreds of federal judges have played in steadfastly holding the executive branch to the law.

But first, the (SCOTUS-related) news.

On the Docket

The Merits Docket

Last week’s regular Order List brought with it the Court’s first two opinions of the term—both of which were “summary reversals” in which the justices reversed a court of appeals at the certiorari stage in an unsigned (“per curiam”) opinion, without hearing oral argument or otherwise conducting plenary review:

In Pitts v. Mississippi, the Court reversed the Supreme Court of Mississippi—which had rejected a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause challenge to a Mississippi statute mandating the physical screening of all child abuse victims from criminal defendants during their testimony. As the Court reaffirmed in a five-page opinion, the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause requires trial courts in those circumstances to make case-specific determinations of whether such screening truly is necessary, regardless of any categorical state law rule to the contrary. There were no public dissents.

And in Clark v. Sweeney, the Court reversed the Fourth Circuit—holding that it had wrongly granted post-conviction habeas relief to a Maryland prisoner based upon an argument that the prisoner had failed to fully and fairly present himself (in a case in which one of the jurors had visited the crime scene without authorization and had subsequently been dismissed). The only issue the prisoner had preserved, the Court held in a four-page opinion, was whether his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by agreeing to allow the case to proceed to a verdict once the juror was dismissed.

When Will Baude coined the term “shadow docket” in 2015, he was specifically responding to a significant uptick at that moment in these kinds of certiorari-stage “summary” rulings. They had rather petered out over the ensuing decade, so it will be interesting to see if the two rulings last Monday end up as outliers, or as a sign that more of these rulings are incoming. Time will tell.

The only other especially noteworthy developments in last Monday’s Order List were the separate opinions respecting the denial of certiorari in Beck v. United States. The issue in Beck is the so-called “Feres doctrine,” an (entirely atextual) interpretation of the Federal Tort Claims Act adopted by the Supreme Court in 1950 that bars any and all lawsuits by military servicemembers against the federal government for torts “arising out of, or incident to” their military service. Justice Thomas has long been (quite rightly, in my view) a staunch critic of Feres, and has been calling, for years, for the justices to revisit that precedent. Alas, he seems to once again have come up short. Although Justice Gorsuch also noted that he would have voted to take up this case, Justice Sotomayor penned a separate “statement” suggesting that it should be up to Congress to fix the mess the Court created—“out of respect for the Court’s rules of stare decisis, and in recognition of the reliance interests that Feres has generated.” Of course, it’s hard to imagine any Congress, let alone the current one, making it easier for servicemembers to sue the federal government. That’s why Feres, handed down just four years after the FTCA was enacted, was so problematic in the first place.

The Emergency Docket

It was a surprisingly quiet week with respect to emergency applications. The only action of note from the full Court came Wednesday—when the Court issued an order … declining to act … on the Trump administration’s request to freeze a lower court ruling that had blocked the attempted removal of Shira Perlmutter as the Register of Copyrights. The Court’s order, from which only Justice Thomas publicly dissented, noted that the application is being deferred pending the Court’s consideration of Trump v. Slaughter (set to be argued next Monday) and Trump v. Cook (set to be argued in January). Frankly, I don’t get it. The underlying question in Perlmutter is a very specific, statutory question (is the Library of Congress an “executive agency” for purposes of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act) the answer to which won’t be implicated at all in those two other cases. And although the second question the justices asked the parties to address in Slaughter (what’s the remedy for federal officers who are unlawfully removed) could obviously affect other cases, Perlmutter is still … in her job, and doesn’t need to be reinstated by a court. This last point, of course, means that the ruling is effectively a loss for the Trump administration. But it’s not clear to me why there wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) have been five votes to just say that now.

The Week Ahead

This morning kicks off a busy week at the Court—with the beginning of the December argument session starting at 10. We also continue to wait for the Court to rule on the two especially high-profile emergency applications that remain pending—Texas’s application in the Texas redistricting case; and the Trump administration’s application in the Illinois National Guard case.

As has so often been true with the Supreme Court this year, there’s a lot going on.

The One First “Long Read”:

Mandatory Detention and the Lyons Memo

To understand the flood of immigration detention cases currently inundating the federal courts, it may be helpful to start with a brief background on immigration detention. I’ll also refer folks who’d like even more detail to this helpful 2019 Congressional Research Service report.

Background

In particular, three points seem especially foundational here.

First, the general immigration detention statute, section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)), provides rules for the arrest and detention of any non-citizen “pending a decision on whether [they are] to be removed from the United States.” But detention under section 236(a) comes, among other things, with a right to a bond hearing (based upon a showing that the individual poses no danger to others; security threat; or flight risk) and eligibility for parole—denials of both of which are subject to judicial review. What’s more, detention under section 236(a) has always been understood to be discretionary—meaning there is no requirement that individuals subject to detention under that provision actually be detained.

Thus, as Judge Kaplan put it last week, “Section 236, since a 1996 amendment, has given immigration authorities essentially two options at the outset of removal proceedings. One option is to keep the noncitizen in custody throughout the proceedings. The other option is to release the noncitizen on bond or parole.” For a host of reasons, the norm, historically, has been to choose the latter—especially for those individuals who have committed no crimes, and who are subject to removal only because they are present in the United States without legal authorization. Those individuals will usually be entitled to release on bond—which, for obvious reasons, has led the executive branch to not prioritize arresting and detaining them in the first place.

Second, and in contrast, there are a handful of more specific “mandatory” detention statutes, which, at least in theory, require the detention of individuals who meet the more specific statutory criteria. The one that is especially relevant here is section 235(b), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b). That provision actually includes two separate authorities. Section 235(b)(1) is for non-citizens stopped at (or near) the border who are “inadmissible”—and who are subject to “expedited” removal “without further hearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.” (The grounds on which someone can be “inadmissible” are a lot more specific than the grounds on which they can be removable.)

Section 235(b)(2), in contrast, mandates detention for the duration of “regular” removal proceedings “in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.” Historically, both parts of section 235(b) have been understood to refer, as the section heading reflects, to “applicants for admission” to the United States, i.e., those stopped either (1) at the border; or (2) within some temporal and geographic proximity to having entered the country without inspection. Those who are inadmissible [section 235(b)(1)] can be placed in expedited removal; those who are not [section 235(b)(2)] must go through ordinary removal proceedings during which they can be detained without bond.

Indeed, when section 235(b)(2) applies, not only is there no statutory right to a bond hearing, but the only mechanism for internal review by ICE (a narrow form of humanitarian parole) is not subject to judicial review, either. Thus, there are massively significant differences between detention under section 235(b)(2) and detention under section 236(a)—including not just the likelihood of detention but also the ability of someone detained under these provisions to challenge the factual or legal basis for that detention, or even to seek release on bond while those proceedings continue.

Third, during both the first and second Trump administrations, the executive branch has separately tried to expand the category of individuals subject to expedited removal (and mandatory detention under section 235(b)(1)) based upon when they entered into the United States without inspection. In other words, it’s tried to move the line for who counts as an “arriving alien” to include at least some individuals who have been in the United States for some time. For context, in 2004, the Bush administration had (controversially) interpreted that category to include those stopped at the border or those apprehended (1) within 100 miles of the border and (2) within 14 days of entering the country without inspection. That was a big enough move, but that was the understood (and judicially sustained) limit on who could be subjected to “expedited removal” for decades.

The Trump administration has since sought to expand that category dramatically—to include anyone found anywhere in the United States who cannot prove their continuous presence in the United States for more than two years (the statutory maximum Congress authorized in 1996). But that attempted policy shift was blocked by a D.C. federal district judge on August 29—primarily on the ground that it likely violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by depriving those with significant connections to the United States of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the basis for their expedited removal. Just last Monday, the D.C. Circuit, by a 2-1 vote, denied in relevant part the federal government’s application for a stay of that ruling pending appeal.

***

There’s a lot of complicated immigration law here, and I’m already giving short shrift to some of the nuances. (The American Immigration Council has published a fantastic practice advisory that goes into much more detail for those who are so inclined.) The key for present purposes is that, prior to the July 8 detention policy shift, even the Trump administration’s view had been that, once an individual had been continuously present in the United States for at least two years, they were no longer subject to expedited removal as if they were an “arriving alien” under section 235(b)(1)—and the “ordinary” immigration process [section 236(a)] would otherwise apply barring special circumstances. Those individuals could still be subject to mandatory detention if they fell into one of the specific categories of such detention (e.g., certain individuals convicted of crimes or for the 90 days preceding the effectuation of a removal order). But absent those special circumstances, individuals who had been continuously present in the United States for at least two years (under the Trump administration’s contested view) or even just two weeks (under the Bush administration’s view) were subject to arrest and detention only under the more generous, bond-eligible, discretionary authority of section 236(a).

I’m not aware of any specific data on what percentage of the total population of non-citizens living today in the United States without inspection has been continuously present in the United States for at least two years. But a 2024 DHS report found that 79% of undocumented immigrants had been present in the United States since before 2010. It stands to reason that the percentage of that population who have been in the United States since at least November 2023 is … much higher. In other words, there are a lot more undocumented immigrants who have been continuously present in the United States for more than two years than who have not been.

The July 8 Memo and Subsequent Developments

On July 8, Todd Lyons, then the Acting Director of ICE, issued a memorandum titled “Interim Guidance Regarding Detention Authority for Applicants for Admission.” In it, Lyons wrote that “It is the position of DHS that [any non-citizens who entered the United States without being admitted] are subject to detention under INA § 235(b) and may not be released from ICE custody except by INA § 212(d)(5) parole.” To make the point clear, the memo continued, “For custody purposes, these aliens are now treated in the same manner that ‘arriving aliens’ have historically been treated.” The only non-citizens who would still be covered by the “ordinary” detention provision would be those who had been lawfully admitted to the United States upon entry or received some lawful status thereafter, only to have committed some immigration or criminal offense that subjects them to removal.

Just to underscore the point, the Lyons memo effectively subjected to immediate arrest and to mandatory detention pending removal every single non-citizen physically present in the United States who had never been lawfully admitted, no matter how long they have been here or how carefully they’ve followed the law since their arrival. And although initial headlines (e.g., in the Washington Post) highlighted that the memo revoked those individuals’ right to a bond hearing, no less important is the extent to which it subjected them to arrest and detention in the first place—arrest and detention that would not have been a realistic possibility, even if it was formally available, under section 236(a). A non-citizen, for instance, who came to the United States with their parents when they were a child, and who has lived in the country for decades without committing any crimes, is now subject to mandatory detention with no possibility of bond under the July 8 memo; before that, even if the law might have allowed for their arrest and detention, they would almost certainly have been released on bond for the duration of their removal proceedings—assuming the government wanted to remove them in the first place.

Almost overnight, as ICE started implementing the July 8 policy, individuals who, all of a sudden, were subject to arrest and detention under the new interpretation of these 29-year-old statutes brought habeas petitions challenging their detention in the federal district court in which they were held. This led to a remarkable flurry of rulings by federal district judges across the country—as reflected in a public database maintained by the American Immigration Council in conjunction with the University of Iowa immigration law clinic. And the judges in the overwhelming majority of those rulings have concluded that the July 8 policy is unlawful—because section 235(b), by its terms, does not apply to individuals who are not “seeking admission into the country” (because they have already been here for some time). As one district court succinctly put it in August, “someone who enters a movie theater without purchasing a ticket and then proceeds to sit through the first few minutes of a film would not ordinarily then be described as ‘seeking admission’ to the theater.”

Although I could link to any of dozens of these rulings, two especially illustrative examples are last Wednesday’s decision by Judge Kaplan in Manhattan; and a ruling from the previous week by Judge Lynn Winmill in Idaho. As Judge Kaplan concluded, “Requiring the detention of noncitizens like [the petitioner in that case] would be inconsistent with how immigration law in this country long has worked, not to mention the rule of law and basic notions of due process.” And in Judge Winmill’s words,

Since the United States began restricting immigration into this country in the late 19th century, it has distinguished between those noncitizens seeking entry into the country and those already residing within it. Noncitizens “stopped at the boundary line” who have “gained no foothold in the United States,” do not enjoy the same constitutional protections afforded to persons inside the United States. But once a noncitizen enters the United States, “the legal circumstance changes,” for the constitutional right to due process applies to all “persons” within our nation’s borders, “whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” This distinction between noncitizens who have entered and reside in the United States and those who have not yet entered “runs throughout immigration law.”

It’s not just that this distinction “runs throughout immigration law”; it’s that it also reflects the more humane reality that, however they entered the United States, those who have lived in the country for years (if not decades), and who have pose no risk to their communities or the country, may lawfully be subject to removal—but they do not pose the same risk justifying aggressive (and expensive) uses of law enforcement resources along the way.

To be sure, there have been a handful of rulings in the other direction—most notably a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (which is in the Department of Justice) in September—which, among other things, effectively bars any of the Department’s internal immigration judges from ruling otherwise. Indeed, that’s a big part of why so many of these cases have ended up in federal district court. But the arguments the district courts keep embracing seem pretty straightforward to me, regardless of one’s preferred approach to statutory interpretation. Even the Supreme Court, as recently as 2018, was clear on the core distinction here: “U.S. immigration law authorizes the Government to detain certain aliens seeking admission into the country under §§ 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2). It also authorizes the Government to detain certain aliens already in the country pending the outcome of removal proceedings under §§ 1226(a) and (c).” Indeed.

***

It’s hard to predict exactly what’s going to happen next in these fast-moving cases. As Kyle Cheney noted in his Politico piece last week, “The Trump administration has asked appeals courts in the Texas-based 5th Circuit and the Missouri-based 8th Circuit for expedited rulings on the matter. But it has also asked appeals courts in other parts of the country to slow-walk their consideration.” And the class certification order in the Central District of California case can also be immediately appealed—at least with the permission of the Ninth Circuit.

One way or the other, it stands to reason that the legality of the Lyons memo will make its way to the Supreme Court sooner, rather than later. And when it does, it will necessarily be one of the most important immigration disputes to arise out of this administration’s efforts to date—not just because of the number of people who are directly affected by the policy (and how it affects them), but because of how fundamentally it attempts to rewrite a distinction that U.S. immigration law (and the Supreme Court’s own case law) has maintained since at least the 1950s: Between those stopped at the border, and those who, through whatever means, are living their lives on U.S. soil—to whom the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment unquestionably applies. To borrow a line from Adam Serwer, the cruelty may well be the point of the Lyons memo. But the law demands—and ought to demand—a heck of a lot more.

SCOTUS Trivia: The First Monday in … December?

This isn’t Supreme Court trivia, per se. But I’ve been spending a lot of time recently with old congressional records, and wanted to flag a quirk that’s in the text of the original Constitution and that says quite a lot about how the Founders originally envisioned the job of being a member of Congress. Specifically, as Article I, Section 4, Clause 2 of the Constitution provided, “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.”

Thus, congressional sessions typically began on the first Monday in December, even for a Congress that entered into office that March—from the Founding all the way through the entrance into force of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933. Section 2 of that latter proviso specifies that “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.” And although Congress has, at various points, appointed a different day for the beginning of the next session, the strong norm has been to follow the constitutional formulation (as amended) throughout our history.

Among other things, the First Monday in December Clause meant not only that Congress was often out of session for months even after newly being elected, but that the second session of each Congress typically post-dated the intervening elections—during which many of the members would often be “lame ducks.”

There’s broad consensus on why the Founders initially opted for December. As one historical note on the Senate’s website explains, “The 18th-century framers of the United States Constitution, accustomed to an agriculturally based economy with its cycles of planting, growing, and harvesting, considered the mostly dormant month of December to be a particularly good time for senators and representatives to begin their legislative sessions.” The Supreme Court, too, eventually followed the same pattern—with its term beginning on the first Monday in January as of 1827; and the first Monday in December as of 1844 (where it remained until 1873). In other words, the First Monday in December used to mark the beginning of the work year for official Washington—with the business at hand usually (albeit not always) wrapped up by the end of June, if not sooner. Even back then, it seems, no one wanted to spend their summers in the District of Columbia.

Former Select Board member Terri Ackerman says Immigration and Customs Enforcement flights raise key questions for Hanscom Field administrators.

She hopes authorities embrace a possible legal answer.

“Don’t they want to protect against human trafficking?” she asked in a recent Concord Bridge interview, flagging fears about due process violations and unsafe conditions. “Don’t they want to have safety protocols so nobody dies on the plane?”

An ICE spokesperson confirmed the agency resumed using Hanscom in September to shuttle detainees around the country.

As human rights advocates ramp up pressure, New Hampshire-based lawyer Megan Chapman has offered to discuss options under the constitutional “Anti-Commandeering Doctrine” to at least extract detainee protections.

“It has to be carefully crafted, but there are ways states, state agencies, [and] state subdivisions can stand up and assert their independent sovereignty,” she told the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission.

Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan told The Bridge in a statement that the agency “is open to any and all suggestions,” but “our understanding is” that a federal court rejected this argument under similar circumstances.

Facing related transparency demands, one leader recently doubled down on claims that Massport wasn’t being notified when ICE used its runways. Newly released emails show that wasn’t entirely true.

Email disclosures

ICE staff won’t share specifics about their Hanscom presence.

Airport advisors asked Massport for ICE flight data. Hanscom Director Christopher Willenborg responded with a letter saying, in part, that officials “do not receive advance notification.”

An advocate tested this with a public records request and received a September 5 exchange between Willenborg and a representative for Signature Aviation, an airfield service provider.

Signature’s Hanscom general manager, Tony Caruso, told Willenborg that “ICE charter flights” were set for “this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon,” according to a copy of the emails that was shared with The Bridge.

Willenborg asked Caruso to call him.

The advocate who obtained Caruso’s emails asked to remain anonymous. The Lexington Observer first reported the content of the conversation.

Ackerman, who represents Concord on the Hanscom advisory panel, said the contradiction between the emails and Willenborg’s letter to the group “speaks for itself.”

Mehigan said this was the only email chain related to ICE flights at Hanscom in the two years covered under the advocate’s request.

Signature is one of three Hanscom “fixed base operators.” FBOs provide services such as hangar space and, in some cases, refueling.

Mehigan said Massport “has no direct involvement in the scheduling or operations of these flights” and they’re “managed exclusively by the fixed base operators.”

Refueling-hazard questions

Willenborg referred the advisory commission to ICE for flight data. On November 18, members peppered an ICE representative with additional questions.

HFAC Chair Margaret Coppe asked whether agents leave shackled detainees in their seats while crews refuel planes.

“What if, God forbid, there were some sort of accident during the refueling?” she said.

Chris Celozzi, an ICE Boston public affairs representative, said he couldn’t answer questions himself but would report back to his bosses. The Bridge contacted an ICE spokesperson after the meeting, but didn’t hear back.

Demonstrators have rallied against detainee flights and singled out Signature for allegedly supporting detainee flights.

In an unsigned statement this summer, a corporate spokesperson said Signature doesn’t release client information.

The spokesperson said Signature must “indiscriminately support flight operations” that meet applicable requirements and said the firm is focused on providing “safe, consistent, and comprehensive” support.

Not everyone opposes current federal policy or calls to bounce ICE from Hanscom.

“They’re following the federal law,” Concordian Chris Reynolds said during an early-October demonstration in Monument Square. “If the law needs to be changed, then we should change the law — not decide not to obey it.”

On the advisory commission, most panelists have condemned immigration enforcement tactics under President Donald Trump.

HFAC pressured Massport, and members now hope the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine — rooted in the 10th Amendment — will spur the quasi-public agency to stiffen its spine.

Rules and guardrails

Chapman said she and others on a pro bono legal team have been in touch with New Hampshire authorities about previous flights at Pease International Airport. She’s presented at several meetings in recent months and told the Hanscom advisory commission that she’d be “more than happy” to help Massport draft requirements for ICE.

Ackerman suggested these could include guardrails around refueling and a requirement to share information.

Chapman said rules could also include screening of each passenger to make sure ICE isn’t denying anyone due process or moving someone in violation of a court order.

These kinds of requirements have precedent, Chapman said, adding, “When those kinds of restrictions are put in place, oftentimes it means that ICE decides to stop operating through that airport.”

Chapman suggested meeting with Massport’s legal team. Hanscom Manager of Administration Amber Goodspeed said she would relay the invitation. Ackerman volunteered to be part of a meeting.

“I’m very interested to see if Massport will hear us out,” Ackerman told The Bridge. “We’re hoping that they will see the light.”",https://concordbridge.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HANSCOM-ICE-1-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 08:57:31.440498
,Human Rights,2025-12-01 11:04:29+00:00,Colorado Public Radio,"Deportation flights hit new high in Colorado, part of nationwide immigration crackdown","Allison Sherry, Ishan Thakore, Chandra Thomas Whitfield, Ryan Warner, Ben Markus",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/12/01/colorado-deportation-flights-immigration/,"A report by the Human Rights First organization analyzed 11 months of deportation and removal flights from various cities with detention facilities, like Aurora.
The organization found that more than 1,700 removal flights reached 77 countries under the Trump administration.
That is a 79 percent increase in flights compared to the previous year during the Biden administration.
The organization used publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, including deportation flights and domestic transfers between U.S. detention centers and deportation staging facilities.
In Colorado, 74 domestic transfer flights left in 2024, and the 2025 numbers represent a 55 percent increase.","More than 115 immigration detention flights have left Denver this year for other U.S. cities, an extraordinary number that is making it hard for immigration lawyers to help their clients and perhaps accelerating the number of deportations out of the U.S.

“The purpose of detention is so they can show up to court. It’s illegal for it to be punitive because it’s civil confinement, so it’s particularly head-scratching that someone who has a court hearing in Aurora tomorrow is transferred away,” said immigration attorney Laura Lunn. “We show up to court and a GEO (detention center) official is telling us, ‘Oh, this person isn’t here, they were transferred,’ and the judge asks, ‘Well, are they going to be brought to court?’ And the answer sometimes is ‘no’”

The surge in domestic detention flights is also seen in deportation flights to other countries.

A report by the Human Rights First organization analyzed 11 months of deportation and removal flights from various cities with detention facilities, like Aurora. The organization found that more than 1,700 removal flights reached 77 countries under the Trump administration.

That is a 79 percent increase in flights compared to the previous year during the Biden administration. Trump’s administration has also added 34 countries to the list of where people are heading.

New removal destinations this year include Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland), Iran, Jordan, Mali, Sri Lanka and Morocco.

The organization used publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, including deportation flights and domestic transfers between U.S. detention centers and deportation staging facilities.

In Colorado, 74 domestic transfer flights left in 2024, and the 2025 numbers represent a 55 percent increase.

The report found that there was a record number of “third country” transfers, which means immigrants were transferred to countries they’re not from. Those transfers included non-Guatemalans to Guatemala and non-Hondurans to Honduras. There were also third-country nationals sent to Eswatini and Ghana, both African countries, the report said.

In Colorado, the 115 flights that departed from here were sent purely to other domestic destinations, though researchers found a number of those destinations, including in Arizona, Texas and Louisiana, were deportation staging areas to out-of-country locales like Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and earlier in the year, to El Salvador.

El Salvador houses the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, a prison known for human rights abuses and torture. The ACLU of Colorado told a federal judge in April that at least 11 Venezuelans detained in Aurora’s GEO detention facility were transferred there in the early parts of 2025.

More commonly, however, the immigrants detained in Colorado were just shuffled to another detention center in another state, far away from family and their lawyers — if they had counsel, said Sari Arvey with the D.C.-based Human Rights First organization.

Arvey said being moved at a moment’s notice, sometimes days or hours before a hearing, is chaotic and unfair.

“It’s a disoriented process; people often don’t know where these flights are going, they only find out upon arrival,” Arvey said. “Tracking these flights around the United States has given us some insight into the rapid movement of people from our communities around the country.”

The federal government’s own policies say that transfers within immigration detention should only happen in “exigent” circumstances and shouldn’t take place if that immigrant has an attorney on record, said Lunn, a detention attorney for the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network.

“None of that guidance is being followed right now,” she said.

Lunn has been representing people inside detention for 14 years, and she’s never seen such frequent confusion and movement within the system as in 2025. Lunn has been the lawyer sitting at the table with a no-show client because they were moved in the middle of the night without any notification.

Brian Green, a Denver-based immigration attorney who represents people in habeas corpus lawsuits, said it’s happening more now, but there are also more people being detained now.

“It’s probably a product of both,” Green said.

Green said once someone is detained, he’s often quickly filing emergency petitions to get the person either released or at least an order for them to stay in their home state.

“I’m filing emergency lawsuits as fast as possible, and I’m trying to get the habeas before they get moved,” he said.

He said he had a West Virginia client who was moving around, and when the habeas petition was granted by a judge, ICE had to stop shifting her around detention centers.

Lunn, too, has filed emergency motions, sometimes in 30 minutes, to get clients’ planned transfers halted. Her biggest fear is that they’ll be moved to a third country, a place they’re not from and have no family or counsel.

“At this point, I’m telling clients affirmatively this is the plan of what you should do if you get word you’re getting transferred, it’s so common,” Lunn said, noting that ICE turns off phones inside the Aurora detention center when a transfer is planned so they can’t reach her, even if it’s the middle of the night. “Promptly, with my heart beating, I file something quickly with the district court to try and make sure my client stays here in Colorado.”",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/deportation-flight-texas-file-ap-01.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 08:57:50.447982

But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane.
Since it has long been impossible to travel to the UK lawfully with a view to claiming asylum, arrivals can mean only one thing – boat arrivals.
And now the final action point... A new asylum system – fair or manageable?
People with a British partner or child do not take a dangerous boat trip to claim asylum.","On 21 November 2025 the government published a new policy paper, Restoring Order and Control: A Statement on the government's asylum and returns policy, described as ""perhaps the most substantial reform to the UK's asylum system in a generation"".

In the Foreword to the Statement, the Prime Minister goes out of his way to proclaim his (Labour's) unwavering commitment to fairness, compassion and humanity in the treatment of refugees: ""The principle that people genuinely fleeing danger and persecution should be welcomed is one this government will always defend – an expression of the UK's values in action. But that principle depends upon social confidence that our asylum system is fair, effective and humane. This statement shows how a reformed asylum system, that deters arrivals and speeds up the removals of those with no legal right to be here, can deliver that confidence in a dangerous world.""

By a coincidence, or a subconscious nudge, I happened to wash the Statement down with Casablanca, a 1942 film by Michael Curtiz, set in Vichy controlled Casablanca in 1942. It sends shivers down the spine to think that most of the actors in this film were refugees from the Nazis. It's a perfect foil to the current crisis, and it helps to take the Statement with a pinch of salt. After all, it is all sound a fury but, unlike Casablanca, played out by second-rate thespians.

The Statement has three action points:

Reducing arrivals

Increasing removals

New rules to make the system (un)fairer for refugees and (less) manageable for authorities

Reducing arrivals

This part of the Statement must refer to small boat arrivals, not arrivals by plane or Eurostar. Since it has long been impossible to travel to the UK lawfully with a view to claiming asylum, arrivals can mean only one thing – boat arrivals.

The bad news is that there is not a single word in the Statement as to how to reduce boat arrivals. Promises of destitution, ill treatment, marginalisation, no recognition of human rights, quick refusal of applications, reduced rights of appeal, denial of accommodation and subsistence, all sound like thunder and fury, but unlikely to deter anyone fleeing a war or seeking adventure.

The scary part of the Statement is, of course, that ill treatment, destitution and marginalisation will become an official endorsed and authorised part of the society. The hungry, homeless, destitute and marginalised arrivals will be funnelled into shadow economy and/or ...

Here we come to the second action point.

Increasing removals

Not that before the Statement was published the official policy was to reduce removals. Not at all. If someone's visa had expired and their rights of appeal were exhausted, they have always been expected to leave. For those who could not afford a plane ticket the government has been offering assisted return. Those who absconded and went to ground have long been liable to removal without consent.

The problem is not that the laws are lax, but that for some reason enforcement action is often delayed for years and years.

Until 2012, 14 years' delay on the part of the authorities resulted in acceptance of the individual as a lawful and permanent resident. Since 2012, this rule changed and it has been 20 years' delay on the part of the authorities that resulted in recognition of an individual's claim to regularise their immigration status, with a further 10 years of lawful residence required to become permanently settled.

By taking away this highly remote possibility of being accepted within the legal system, the government doesn't support the declared commitment to increase removals. On the contrary, the marginalised and destitute will remain so forever, or at least until the authorities finally decide to remove them, be it after 20, 30, 40 or 60 years. Moreover, their children and possibly grandchildren will be in the same boat, so to speak.

We can pause for a moment when it comes to children. The Statement contains some chilling remarks to the effect that parents exploit the fact that they have children who came with them on a dangerous trip, to thwart removal from the UK. The missing part to this, is that the child is only considered to have put down roots in the UK if they have lived in the UK for 7 years and it is not reasonable to expect them to leave!

There is still a rule allowing registration of children born in the UK as British citizens (provided their parents don't forget to do so before the child turns 18!). There are also rules allowing regularisation of status of young adults (under 25) who have spent more than half of their life in the UK. (Young adults have to think about it before they turn 25!)

We don't yet know whether children and young adults will be left with some options, or these options will also be taken away to deter the parents from hoping for a brighter future for the kids. The logic and fierce zeal of the Statement suggests that sooner or later the children will also go to the infernal nooks of the shadow economy.

And now the final action point...

A new asylum system – fair or manageable?

Instead of grant of asylum for 5 years with a review at the end of the 5-year period and subsequent grant of permanent right of residence, refugees will have to repeatedly claim asylum every 2.5 years for a 20-year period, before they can qualify for permanent status.

No right to family reunion – meaning a refugee who has made it to the UK and has been recognised as a person in need of protection will not be allowed to invite spouse and children to join them.

No legal obligation to provide support for destitute asylum seekers

Expropriation of assets with the exception of wedding rings

No financial support for those who have the right to work. You will see the irony of this proposition if you realise that right to work is only granted to those whose claim has not been decided for 12 months and only in extremely limited occupations listed in the Immigration Salary List. Examples include: social and humanities scientist, biological or chemical scientists, graphic designers, classical ballet dancers and choreographers, orchestral musicians who are leaders, principals or numbered string positions in internationally recognised UK orchestras. Further options include racing grooms and stallion handlers, nursing auxiliaries and assistants, as well as carpenters, roofers and bricklayers. You can almost hear the piteous personal entreaty. If you know a decent carpenter, please let me know!

A new appeals body to be created. The Statement refers to it an independent body with professionally trained adjudicators. It remains to be seen if the independent bodies will not simply be part of the Home Office. There will be no right of appeal from their adjudication and no judicial control over legality of their decisions.

Denying appeal rights for clearly unmeritorious claims – there is not much new in this. As it is claims certified as manifestly unfounded can only be appealed from outside the UK.

Review of Article 8 balancing exercise which weighs public interest against the right to protection of family life for individual families.It may be appropriate at this point to clarify that Article 8 is not, and has never been, a basis for claiming asylum.

As mentioned above, since 2012, the right to private life protected under Article 8 ECHR only applies in immigration context if the person has lived in the UK for a continuous period of 20 years. The right to protection of family life applies where there is a British or settled partner and/or a British or settled child. People with a British partner or child do not take a dangerous boat trip to claim asylum. They make an application for a visa as a partner or parent.

A quick glance on the role of Article 8 in family immigration.

The Immigration Rules provide that only insurmountable obstacles to living with British partner outside they UK would justify waiver of the financial requirements for the partner visa. Where the financial requirements can be met but not through the specified sources of income, the requirement can be waived only if the refusal could result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner or child. Where the refusal would clearly result in unjustifiably harsh consequences, the decision-maker must exercise discretion. The only other exception applies where refusal of permission to stay would break a relationship between parent and child settled in the UK.

In summary

There is much less news in the ""most substantial reform"" than the government would like to make it sound. Denial of financial support to destitute asylum seekers and expropriation of assets from people arriving in small boats sounds macabre, but it's hardly promising in terms of restoring order or control. The statement, like life itself, is full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

Any major policy change naturally attracts national attention. The proposed Bill C- 12 immigration amendments have become one of the most talked-about developments this year, mainly because of the wide range of concerns raised across the country.

Refugee advocates, legal experts, settlement workers, and community groups have voiced worries that the bill could affect the rights of vulnerable individuals. With a final parliamentary vote approaching, many Canadians want clarity. This blog breaks down what the bill contains, why it has sparked debate and what this means for newcomers and refugees planning their future in Canada.

Why Bill C-12 Immigration Reform Matters Right Now

The conversation around Bill C-12 immigration reform began because several groups believe the proposed changes could influence safety, due process, and access to protection. The bill affects the refugee determination process, information sharing practices, and the government’s authority to review or suspend immigration documents.

Instead of increasing efficiency, groups fear that the policy may create more obstacles and greater risks, especially for individuals escaping dangerous conditions. At the heart of the concern lies one core message: any shift in immigration laws must protect the rights of people who look to Canada for safety.

Key Issues Raised by Refugee and Human Rights Groups

To help readers understand the situation more clearly, here are the major themes raised across Canada:

1. Limited Access to Fair Refugee Hearings

Many organizations worry that the bill introduces shorter timelines and restricted appeal opportunities. These changes may prevent refugee claimants from presenting complete evidence, especially those recovering from trauma or fleeing recent threats.

Legal experts caution that reduced appeal pathways can lead to higher refusal rates and more cases being pushed toward federal courts, increasing delays rather than reducing them.

2. Impact on People Affected by the Safe Third Country Agreement

Canada’s agreement with the United States already limits access for many refugees. Concerns are rising that the bill could intensify these challenges, sending more individuals back to the U.S. system, where human rights groups have documented serious problems.

For newcomers who rely on Canada’s fair and transparent processes, this sparks fear of being denied protection even in situations involving real risk.

3. Increased Government Power Without Clear Safeguards

Bill C -12 grants authorities the ability to suspend or cancel immigration documents based on broad public interest reasons. Critics argue that the bill does not define these reasons clearly enough.

The lack of safeguards could create unfair outcomes, especially for people with ongoing claims or those waiting for decisions.

4. Concerns About Sharing Sensitive Personal Information

Another major issue is the sharing of private immigration details with various agencies. This includes information about gender identity or refugee claim status, which could expose individuals to discrimination or harm.

Advocacy groups believe that stronger privacy protections are essential to keep vulnerable individuals safe.

5. Broader Social Effects Linked to Drug Policy Provisions

A portion of the bill ties immigration rules to drug enforcement measures. Public health organizations argue that this method has not improved safety in the past. Instead, they recommend investing in social supports and housing to create healthier communities.

Why These Concerns Matter to Canadians

Canada has always taken pride in being a safe and welcoming destination for people seeking a new beginning. For decades, the country has provided protection to families escaping danger and offered a structured pathway to rebuild their lives. Any policy that risks reducing fairness or safety deserves careful review. This is why so many Canadian organizations have called for more debate, more hearings, and more public input before the bill moves forward.

Across Canada, people want clarity on how the bill will be implemented, who will be affected, and what protections will remain in place.

What Newcomers Should Expect in the Coming Weeks

Since parliamentary review is still underway, nothing is finalized yet. However, based on what has been shared publicly:

More debates are expected before the final decision.

Community organizations continue to request amendments.

Additional details from the government may be released soon.

United Nations human rights experts have highlighted “widespread and systematic” exploitation, deception, and deepening debt bondage of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia.

Over 800,000 Bangladeshis have Malaysian work permits, making them the largest group of documented foreign workers in the country. According to information received by the UN, thousands of workers are stranded in Bangladesh or face exploitation in Malaysia after some paid recruitment fees five times higher than the official rate.

Other abuses, including confiscation of passports by Malaysian employers, false job promises, discrepancies between contracts and promised employment packages, and a lack of support from responsible government agencies, are common in Malaysia.

Workers without proper documentation are at risk of arrest, detention, ill-treatment, and deportation under Malaysia’s draconian immigration act, which criminalizes irregular entry, and other anti-migrant policies. Malaysian authorities conduct frequent immigration raids and hold an estimated 18,000 migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers in immigration detention centers…

The Bangladeshi and Malaysian governments, as well as those of other labor-sending or receiving countries and those where buying companies are headquartered such as the US, EU members, and the United Kingdom, have obligations to ensure labor migration is conducted in a way that protects workers’ rights. Malaysia and labor-sending governments like Bangladesh should implement the UN experts’ call to promptly investigate reported abuses and provide effective remedies.

A new scandal ... or a new shiny object will be along.” One reason for the changing nature of political scandal, and its prognosis, is the way we now take in information, both selectively and in bulk.
“A lot of scandals may not have the impact that they once had because people are in these silos or echo chambers,” said Scott Basinger, a University of Houston political scientist who’s extensively studied the nature of political scandal.","A few weeks ago, Katie Porter’s campaign for California governor was reeling. A day after an irritable TV interview went viral, an old video surfaced of the former Orange County congresswoman cursing and berating one of her aides.

Around the same time, the race for U.S. Senate in Maine was shaken by a number of disturbing online posts. In them, Democratic hopeful Graham Platner disparaged police and Black people, among other crude remarks. Soon after, it was revealed Platner had a chest tattoo resembling a Nazi symbol.

Meanwhile, in Virginia, several old text messages swallowed attorney general nominee Jay Jones in a cumulus of controversy. The Democrat had joked about shooting the Republican leader of the state House and blithely spoken of watching his children die in their mother’s arms.

Once — say, 20 or 30 years ago — those blow-ups might have been enough to chase each of those embattled candidates from their respective races, and maybe even end their political careers altogether.

But in California, Porter has pressed on and remains in the top tier of the crowded gubernatorial field. In Maine, Platner continues to draw large, enthusiastic crowds and leads polling in the Democratic primary. In Virginia, Jones was just elected attorney general, defeating his Republican opponent by a comfortable margin.

Clearly, things have changed.

Actions that once caused eyes to widen, such as the recreational puffs of marijuana that cost appeals court judge Douglas Ginsburg a Supreme Court seat under President Reagan, now seem quaint. Personal indiscretions once seen as disqualifying, such as the extramarital affair that chased Gary Hart from the 1988 presidential race, scarcely raise an eyebrow.

And the old political playbook — confession, contrition, capitulation — is obviously no longer operative, as candidates find it not only possible but even advantageous to brazen their way through storms of uproar and opprobrium.

Look no further than the extravagantly checkered occupant of the White House. Donald Trump has seemingly survived more controversies — not to mention two impeachments, an $83.3-million judgment in a sexual abuse and defamation case and conviction on 34 felony counts — than there are stars winking in the nighttime sky.

Bill Carrick has spent decades strategizing for Democratic office-seekers. A generation or so ago, if faced with a serious scandal, he would have told his candidate, “This is not going to be sustainable and you just better get out.” But now, Carrick said, “I would be very reluctant to tell somebody that, unless there was evidence they had murdered or kidnapped somebody, or robbed a bank.”

Kevin Madden, a veteran Republican communications strategist, agreed. Surrender has become passe. Survival is the new fallback mode.

“The one thing that many politicians of both parties have learned is that there is an opportunity to grind it out, to ride the storm out,” Madden said. “If you think a news issue is going viral or becoming the topic everyone’s talking about, just wait. A new scandal ... or a new shiny object will be along.”

One reason for the changing nature of political scandal, and its prognosis, is the way we now take in information, both selectively and in bulk.

With the chance to personally curate their news feed — and reinforce their attitude and outlook — people can select those things they wish to know about, and choose those they care to ignore. With such fragmentation, it’s much harder for a negative storyline to reach critical mass. That requires a mass audience.

“A lot of scandals may not have the impact that they once had because people are in these silos or echo chambers,” said Scott Basinger, a University of Houston political scientist who’s extensively studied the nature of political scandal. “They may not even hear about it, if they don’t want to hear about it.”

The sheer velocity of information — “not only delivered to you on your doorstep, or at 6:30 p.m. by the three networks, but also in your pocket, in your hand at all times, across multiple platforms,” as Madden put it — also makes events more fleeting. That makes it harder for any one to penetrate deeply or resonate widely.

“In a world where there’s a wealth of information,” he said, “there’s a poverty of attention.”

Seven months after abruptly dropping out of the 1988 presidential race, Hart jumped back into the contest. “Let’s let the people decide,” he said, after confessing his marital sins.

(He also said in the same interview, a few months before relaunching his candidacy, that he had no intention of doing so.)

Hart did not fare well. Once he’d been the overwhelming front-runner for the Democratic nomination. As a reincarnated candidate, he trudged on for a few months before dropping out for good, having failed to secure a single convention delegate or win double-digit support in any contest.

“The people have decided,” he said, “and now I should not go forward.”

That’s how it should be.

Porter in California and Platner in Maine both faced calls to drop out of their respective races, with critics questioning their conduct and whether they had the right temperament to serve, respectively, as California governor or a U.S. senator. Each has expressed contrition for their actions. (As did Jones, Virginia’s attorney general-elect.)

Voters can take all that into account when they pick their candidate.

If they want a governor who drops f-bombs and snaps at aides, a senator with a history of off-putting remarks or — gulp — an adulterous convicted felon in the White House, that’s their choice.

Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.","As students and workers resume their routines after the Thanksgiving holiday, Siembra NC is warning that the organization has received multiple credible reports to indicate that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is deploying more agents to the Raleigh area for a monthlong operation.

“While we know that this news might cause alarm, we have no sense that ICE is planning the kind of activity that we saw Border Patrol do,” said Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena in a Sunday call with reporters. “The report that we got is that 50 additional agents were going to be deployed to North Carolina for activity starting December 1st.”

The grassroots immigrants rights organization has also had reports that ICE has reserved the same charter flights between Charlotte and Florida’s Jacksonville International Airport as they did last week, scheduled from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6.

Marín Baena declined to talk further about the origin of the information, and NC Newsline was not able to independently confirm it.

Marín Baena noted said the arrests ICE has typically made throughout this year have made it nearly impossible to get to school and work safely. Siembra NC launched the website Ojo Obrero in November to give communities a better sense of where federal enforcement activity has taken place.

“Businesses are being disrupted, classrooms are being disrupted, even people who have become naturalized U.S. citizens are doubting whether they are safe or thinking about what they need to do in the case of these operations,” Marín Baena said.

Many naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders have started to carry their passports just to go grocery shopping.

“My own parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and we had to talk about what would happen, what they should do, were they stopped by a border patrol agent,” Marín Baena said.

She believes the anticipated ICE’s operation in Raleigh comes as the result of remarks made by North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall. Last week, Hall told The News & Observer that ICE and the border patrol were doing important work.

“It looks like they’re doing a pretty good job at it right now. And so, we don’t have much to ask, other than to come back,” Hall said.

Siembra is encouraging North Carolinians who have been impacted by the recent detentions to contact Hall’s office.

“We think that they listen to their own campaign contributors. And so, a few key contributors to Speaker Dustin Hall include political action committees with the N.C. Home Builders Association, Duke Energy and Lowe’s Home Improvement,” said Marín Baena. “We are inviting people to write letters and create illustrated cards to Speaker Hall’s top campaign contributors, specifically explaining why children and their parents should not have to live in fear.”

For business owners who have closed because employees are sheltering in place, Siembra NC is inviting people to post placards explaining that they’re closed “Courtesy of Speaker Destin Hall.”

The organization has also suggested that immigrant workers who miss work because they are sheltering in place can send a “Destin Hall Pass” to their employer.

Hall said on social media that he supports the enforcement action and that Gov. Joh Stein should be “more concerned about the safety of our citizens than protecting criminal illegal aliens.” Hall also faulted Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden for blocking previous ICE detainers and putting undocumented immigrants back onto the streets.

“They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city,” Hall said in a Nov. 17 post on X expressing support for the Border Patrol.

Over the holiday weekend, Homeland Security officials pivoted to focus on the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump announced on Thanksgiving that he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”

The five-day crackdown by Border Patrol in North Carolina resulted in 370 arrests.

Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.

“And we actually don’t know, of those 370 people, how many they’ve already had to let go because they were actually U.S. citizens or green card holders and how many they will have to let go because we’ve documented that they were unconstitutional arrests,” she said.

Marín Baena said she hopes that ICE’s plans change and it does not resume indiscriminate arrests in North Carolina in December. But if they do return, she says immigrant advocates are prepared.

“Thousands of people across the state of North Carolina have received training to get their neighbors safely to school, safely to work.

It is critical that the Working Group uses this opportunity to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty onshore and offshore.”","The Human Rights Law Centre welcomes the visit to Australia of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention from 1 to 12 December.

The visit comes at a critical juncture, as governments across the country pursue ‘tough on crime’ reform to bail and youth justice laws that experts warn will disproportionately impact First Nations people – including children. Most recently, the Allan Government in Victoria introduced the Adult Time for Violent Crime Bill which will mean that children as young as 14 could be locked away for life and will remove the principle that prison for children is the ‘last resort’.

The visit also coincides with the Albanese Government’s attempts to re-detain migrants and refugees previously held in arbitrary immigration detention, the banning of mobile phones in immigration detention and the expansion of Australia’s offshore warehousing regime. Almost 100 people are trapped in Nauru under offshore processing arrangements and 37 people have been abandoned in Papua New Guinea.

Under a new secret offshore deportation deal, at least five refugees living in the Australian community have been permanently exiled to Nauru, with hundreds of further deportations threatened by the Albanese government. Uncertainty also remains for the 800 people previously subjected to Australia’s offshore processing regime who have now built homes in Australia, but remain in limbo on temporary visas.

The Working Group will meet with representatives of government, civil society and people who have experienced detention or incarceration to assess Australia’s compliance with human rights standards in its treatment of people in custody, and to document cases of arbitrary detention.

The Working Group will deliver its preliminary findings at the end of its visit on 12 December 2025 and will present a full report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

This visit to Australia provides a crucial opportunity for governments across the country to be held accountable for laws and policies that harm people and communities.

Maggie Munn, Director, First Nations Justice at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“The Working Group’s visit to Australia comes at a critical time, with governments across this country funnelling children and adults into prisons and places of detention in unjust and unbearable conditions.

“First Nations children belong in playgrounds and with their families and communities. Instead, we see them pipelined into the criminal legal system as young as 10 years old, and subject to inhumane conditions like prolonged solitary confinement, strip searching, and spit hoods. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity to hold governments accountable to international human rights standards and ensure that all children are safe and thriving.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Migration Justice at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, fuelled by unfair laws and policies that deprive marginalised people of their liberty,. Migrants and refugees are facing extended periods in immigration detention and are increasingly criminalised through punitive surveillance measures that extend detention into the community.

The Trump administration was sued in federal court over the program’s suspension and its revocation of congressionally approved resettlement funds.","The Trump administration plans to review and possibly revoke the legal status of refugees resettled in the U.S. during Joe Biden’s presidency.

The order affects more than 200,000 refugees who entered the country legally between Jan. 20, 2021, and Feb. 20, 2025, according to a federal memo reviewed by Reuters.

The document signed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joe Edlow also freezes the processing of permanent residence applications filed by refugees during the previous administration.

“The USCIS memo, dated November 21, said the agency will terminate the refugee status of people already in the U.S. if they are found to not meet refugee criteria,” Reuters reported. “The memo claims the Biden administration potentially prioritized expediency, quantity and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.”

President Donald Trump has taken aggressive measures to end the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program — one of the most secure and highly vetted process for immigrants to come to the United States. His Jan. 20 order, “Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program,” cast refugee resettlement as a threat to national security and contrary to the interests of the nation. He later announced a record-low refugee cap of 7,500 for the current fiscal year and said it would be reserved mostly for white South Africans.

By comparison, refugee limits under Biden reached 125,000 per year from 2022 to 2025. Caps were set much higher in previous years, including more than 220,000 during the Reagan administration.

The Trump administration was sued in federal court over the program’s suspension and its revocation of congressionally approved resettlement funds. A district judge ordered the admission of previously cleared refugees. The litigation, Pacito v. Trump, remains under appeal before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

However, the new USCIS memo refers to the president’s executive order freezing admissions due to the nation’s inability to “absorb large numbers of migrants,” according to Reuters.

Refugee advocates teed off on the administration’s intention to review the cases of resettled immigrants, pointing to the years of rigorous background checks and in-person interviews they underwent to be granted admission.

“To relitigate cases that have already met the demanding security standards of our refugee program is a dramatic reversal of long-standing practice,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge. “Moreover, a review of this scale would divert scarce government resources toward duplicative work, rather than efforts that genuinely strengthen our nation’s security and humanitarian leadership.”

The process also would severely traumatize individuals who escaped severe hardship and oppression in their home countries, she said.

“The administration is attempting to change what it means to be American by targeting who gets to belong.”

“This unprecedented decision introduces profound uncertainty into the lives of families who have endured and legally demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. It risks destabilizing families who have been rebuilding their lives here, working in our communities, sending their children to school, and contributing to the country they now call home.”

Refugees should receive protection instead of further punishment from the U.S. government, added Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.

“Far from being necessary, these purported ‘reviews’ and ‘re-interviews’ are a pretext for the administration’s broader unjust and discriminatory objectives,” she said. “It is abundantly clear that this policy’s impact and its ultimate goal are to deport immigrants from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East who have legal status in the United States and prevent them from becoming citizens.”

The action will destabilize families and American due process, she added. “The administration is attempting to change what it means to be American by targeting who gets to belong. The administration has hijacked the refugee resettlement capacities of the U.S. government to try to deny protection to actual refugees while misusing them to facilitate the migration of white Afrikaners.”

Church World Service condemned the directive as “cruel, illegal and massively wasteful.”

“This administration’s disdain for refugees and newcomers is well-documented, yet it continues to find new ways to outdo itself,” said CWS President Rick Santos. “The decision to review and re-interview resettled refugees — who have already passed through the most stringent of vetting processes — is not merely a re-litigation, but a retraumatizing of individuals who were assured of their safety and a chance to live free of persecution.”

The proclamation came just one day after the protest against US Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents got out of hand, with cops caught in the middle — and protesters now vowing to keep doing it.

“We’ll do it every single time,” Williams vowed.

Police said Sunday that “multiple individuals were taken into custody” at the out-of-control demonstration outside the US General Services Administration building on Centre Street before noon Saturday that saw police officers called in, only to be bombarded with trash and debris.

Cops would not provide more details nor reveal how many were charged, but said cops repeatedly warned the mob to move along, leading to confrontations between the two sides when they refused.

Sources said at least 18 of the demonstrators were charged.

Protesters, who descended upon the city over the weekend, converged on a Lower Manhattan parking garage where federal immigration agents were allegedly ready to deploy for an immigration round-up raid, law enforcement sources said.

On Sunday, advocates called the ongoing raids “horrifying and idiotic.”

“Our neighbors, New Yorkers of every stripe, mobilized, took time out of their day to come here and defend their neighbors to make sure that people were not disappeared, that families were not separated, and stood here for hours,” coalition president and CEO Murad Awawdeh told reporters.

Another pol at the presser was outgoing city Comptroller Brad Lander, who took issue with the NYPD, claiming they “facilitated ICE deportations.

“I really do want to ask the NYPD to remember who you’re sworn to protect and serve, and it’s the people of New York City,” Lander said.

“And yesterday, the people who were protecting and serving New Yorkers were the protesters who showed up.”

However, law enforcement sources told The Post that NYPD brass was less than pleased with New York’s Finest getting caught in the middle of the raucous riot — without a heads-up from the feds.

NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch allegedly gave the feds a tongue-lashing over the Saturday melee, which saw cops pelted with debris when they tried to step in to protect the ICE agents, sources said.

Tisch has agreed to stay on when Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a frequent critic of federal immigration policies under President Trump, takes office after his election victory earlier this month.

Federal authorities have also had to navigate New York’s status as a sanctuary city and policy of not working with ICE on civil arrests and deportations — which runs counter to the Trump administration’s campaign to launch immigration raids throughout the country since taking office.

Meanwhile, immigrant advocates said they’re not going to let up while the raids continue.

“Every time federal officers come into our communities with the intention of conducting lawless raids, of terrorizing our communities, they will be met with non-violent community resistance,” Hannah Stouts, an organizer for Hands Off NYC, said during Sunday’s press conference.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/new-york-city-public-advocate-116464715.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-11-30 21:56:42.751561

I hope everyone had a happy Thanksgiving, as well as a restful and enjoyable long weekend. We spent quality time with both my family and Zach’s family, across three states—Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York—and, of course, we ate too much.

Unfortunately—but unsurprisingly, given the time of year—various family members were under the weather at various points in time. They included our two-year-old son, Chase—who started “school” (read: day care) earlier this month, then came down with some bug three days later. Public service announcement (if you share my belief that vaccines are good): get your flu and Covid shots, if you haven’t already.

Now, on to the news.

Lawyer of the Week: Peter Skandalakis.

On Wednesday, Judge Scott McAfee of Fulton County Superior Court dismissed the Georgia state prosecution of Donald Trump, which accused Trump and a slew of co-defendants of election interference and other offenses arising out of the 2020 presidential election. But credit or blame for the dismissal shouldn’t be given to Judge McAfee; he was merely granting the state’s motion to dismiss the case.

Who filed that motion? As I mentioned earlier this month, Peter Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, was responsible for finding a district attorney to take over the Georgia case from the disqualified Fani Willis. After asking (and getting turned down by) several other prosecutors, Skandalakis took on the case himself. And on Wednesday, Pete Skandalakis filed a motion to dismiss the Trump prosecution, which Judge McAfee promptly granted.

Here are some highlights from Skandalakis’s 22-page motion:

“It is not illegal to question or challenge election results. Our nation’s foundational principles of free speech and electoral scrutiny are rooted in this very freedom. The State of Georgia is no stranger to such challenges. In 2018, Ms. Stacy [sic] Abrams questioned the legitimacy of Brian Kemp’s victory in the gubernatorial race. Likewise, in 2020, many Republicans struggled to accept the reality that President Donald J. Trump did not win the popular vote in Georgia or in other key states and therefore lost the presidential race.”

“While the call [in which Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to ‘find’ enough votes to change the election outcome] is concerning, reasonable minds could differ as to how to interpret the call. One interpretation is that Trump, without explicitly stating it, is instructing the Secretary of State to fictitiously or fraudulently produce enough votes to secure a victory in Georgia. An alternative interpretation is that Trump, genuinely believing fraud had occurred, is asking the Secretary of State to investigate and determine whether sufficient irregularities exist to change the election outcome. When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally.”

“Given the complexity of the legal issues at hand—ranging from constitutional questions and the Supremacy Clause to immunity, jurisdiction, venue, speedy-trial concerns, and access to federal records—and even assuming each of these issues were resolved in the State’s favor, bringing this case before a jury in 2029, 2030, or even 2031 [i.e., after Trump leaves office] would be nothing short of a remarkable feat.”

Not surprisingly, reactions to the dismissal were all over the map—and strongly tracked people’s political views. Readers, what do you think?

Other lawyers in the news:

FBI Director Kash Patel is facing scrutiny for reportedly using FBI SWAT teams to protect his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins.

Erez Reuveni—who worked at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for almost 15 years, before departing amid controversy and then becoming a whistleblower—joined Democracy Forward, the progressive legal advocacy group that’s “working to become the nerve center of the legal opposition to Trump,” in the words of Ankush Khardori of Politico.

One of Biglaw’s longest-tenured leaders, Jami McKeon—who has led Morgan Lewis since 2014—will step down as chair of the firm in September 2026, when her current term expires.

It’s not just Biglaw partners and federal judges: now state prosecutors in California are allegedly filing briefs filled with AI-generated errors, according to defense lawyers who claim to have received briefs with hallucinated citations.

New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani added several lawyers to his transition team, including Legal Aid Society CEO Twyla Carter (my former podcast guest); Julissa Reynoso, former U.S. ambassador to Spain and current Winston & Strawn partner; and veteran election lawyer Jerry Goldfeder.

Judge of the Week: Judge Cameron Currie.

Judges have rejected the Trump administration’s attempts to install U.S. attorneys in multiple districts, including New Jersey, Nevada, and the Central District of California. But Judge Cameron McGowan Currie went a step further than these judges: in addition to holding that Interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan (E.D. Va.) was not validly appointed—i.e., “Ms. Halligan’s appointment violated 28 U.S.C. § 546 and the Appointments Clause” of the Constitution—Judge Currie dismissed two criminal cases as a result. And these weren’t run-of-the-mill cases: Judge Currie tossed the high-profile prosecutions of two Trump adversaries, former FBI director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James.

On whether Halligan was validly appointed, the reasoning of Judge Currie’s decisions in United States v. Comey and United States v. James was unsurprising—consistent with that of the other judges who have tackled this topic. On remedy—i.e., whether the cases could continue without Halligan’s involvement or had to be dismissed—Judge Currie held that they had to be dismissed. As folks familiar with the Supreme Court’s Appointments Clause jurisprudence will recall, the standard remedy in situations where an official hasn’t been validly appointed is to set aside the actions of said official (because they lacked the authority to act in the first place).

In other cases challenging the appointments of Trump U.S. attorneys, additional prosecutors with legitimate appointments were involved in the proceedings, and their involvement was able to protect the prosecutions from dismissal. But in Comey and James, Halligan “appeared alone in front of the grand juries that returned indictments and was the sole prosecutor to have formally signed the charging documents,” per The New York Times—and so this argument was unavailable to the government.

Judge Currie also rejected the administration’s claim that Attorney General Pam Bondi “ratified” Halligan’s actions after the fact. According to Currie, allowing such ratification “would mean the Government could send any private citizen off the street—attorney or not—into the grand jury room to secure an indictment, so long as the Attorney General gives her approval after the fact. That cannot be the law.”

Judge Currie dismissed the Comey and James cases without prejudice, which would allow the government to charge the defendants again. Comey’s lawyers argue that the case can’t be refiled, since the statute of limitations has run on his alleged offenses (he was indicted right before the statute was going to run). But this isn’t entirely clear: a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3288, might give the Trump administration a grace period for refiling (per Sarah Isgur and David French of Advisory Opinions).

What’s next? Attorney General Bondi declared that the DOJ would take “all available legal action, including an immediate appeal”—and I could see this issue eventually making its way to SCOTUS, given that district and circuit courts across the country are currently grappling with messy or questionable prosecutorial appointments.

In addition to attacking the ruling, the Trump administration criticized Judge Currie, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt condemning Currie as a “partisan” judge who was “clearly trying to shield” Comey and James. But Judge Currie, a 1994 Clinton appointee to the District of South Carolina, doesn’t have a partisan record. Even though she’s been on the bench for more than 30 years, this appears to be the most newsworthy and politically charged matter she’s ever handled.

By the way, why is a South Carolina judge ruling in a case out of the Eastern District of Virginia? Because the issue before the court was the validity of the appointment of the U.S. attorney for the E.D. Va., it was sent to a judge outside that district, to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest. According to Judge Currie’s opinion, if Halligan wasn’t validly appointed, the power to appoint an interim U.S. attorney would belong to the judges of the E.D. Va., under 28 U.S.C. § 546 (although the judges of that district haven’t moved since last week’s ruling to appoint anyone).

In other news about judges and the judiciary:

Chief Judge William Pryor (11th Cir.) has had a busy month. On November 14, he delivered the Rice-Hasson Distinguished Lecture at Notre Dame Law School, focusing his remarks on “The Judicial Oath and the Judgment of History.” And this past Wednesday, the noted conservative jurist issued a unanimous ruling against Donald Trump (discussed below under Ruling of the Week)—which he was willing to put his name on, instead of having it issued per curiam (as most circuit courts have done when ruling against Trump personally).

Could Judge Aileen Cannon (S.D. Fla.), who (in)famously handled major civil and criminal cases involving Donald Trump, end up overseeing yet another Trump-centric matter? The Trump administration might be angling for that, with U.S. Attorney Jason Reding Quiñones (S.D. Fla.) using a grand jury at the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce—where Judge Cannon is the only judge—to investigate aspects of the Russia investigation that targeted Trump.

Thanks, but no thanks: Chief Judge James “Jeb” Boasberg (D.D.C.) and Judge Deborah Boardman (D. Md.) declined invitations to appear at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing addressing the topic of impeaching “rogue” judges.

Speaking of jurists offering testimony, Judge Emil Bove (3d Cir.) might have to be a witness in Chief Judge Boasberg’s pending contempt inquiry, examining whether the DOJ defied an order of his in a high-profile immigration case.

Should decisions on the Supreme Court’s interim docket be treated as precedential? In an interesting article for the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, Judge Trevor McFadden (D.D.C.) and Associate Deputy Attorney General Vetan Kapoor argue that these rulings should be treated as binding, if they “grant emergency relief and include a majority opinion explaining the reasons for doing so.” (For discussion of the piece from Sarah Isgur and Adam White, check out Advisory Opinions.)

Judge William Ross Mitchell of Uvalde County, Texas, was suspended without pay, after he was indicted on a misdemeanor charge of “official oppression”—i.e., abuse of his authority as a public official—arising out of a dispute with a UPS driver trying to deliver packages at the courthouse.

November 30, 2025

Opinion. During last year’s Idaho election, a Republican state senator lost his composure when a candidate forum turned to the topic of racism.

Trish Carter-Goodheart, a Democratic candidate and citizen of the Nez Perce Tribe, spoke plainly: Racism and discrimination remain real and persistent in Idaho, pointing to the state’s history of white supremacist enclaves in northern Idaho.

The senator denied any racism existed. When the conversation hit a nerve, he abruptly stormed out, shouting to Carter-Goodheart, “Why don’t you go back to where you came from?”

It was a textbook case of mistaken identity. Carter-Goodheart's ancestors have called this land home for thousands of years.

I know this experience personally. Over the years, I’ve been mistaken for Hispanic. My late mother and several of my aunties shared similar stories — people assuming they spoke Spanish or belonged to another group.

For Native Americans, being questioned about who we are is nothing new. But today, that confusion has become dangerous. With U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operating as though anyone with darker skin is fair game for detention, mistaken identity has become a threat.

Native Americans — whose ancestors were the first inhabitants of this land — are being stopped by masked ICE agents across the country. Why? Because some agents see darker-skinned individuals as potential undocumented immigrants based solely on appearance.

It’s an assault on identity, on tribal sovereignty, and on basic human dignity.

Our most-read article on Native News Online this week involved Native American actress Elaine Miles, who was detained by four ICE agents while walking to a bus stop in Redmond, Wash., near Seattle.

Best known for her role as Marilyn Whirlwind in the television series Northern Exposure and in films such as Smoke Signals and The Business of Fancydancing, Miles is a card-carrying member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation.

According to what she shared with The Seattle Times, she did exactly what any citizen should do — she presented her federally recognized tribal ID when ICE agents demanded identification.

That should have been the end of it.

For those of us who are citizens of federally recognized tribes, a tribal ID is our primary form of identification. I have used mine to get past TSA agents at airports. Miles has used hers to cross international borders. Federal agencies accept it. Yet one of the agents told her the card was “fake.” Another said, “Anyone can make that.”

Miles said both her son and her uncle were previously detained by ICE agents who initially refused to accept their tribal IDs before eventually releasing them.

“What we’re talking about here is racial profiling,” Seattle-based Indigenous rights attorney Gabriel Galanda, who is not representing Miles, told The Seattle Times. “People are getting pulled over or detained on the street because of the dark color of their skin.”

In another story Native News Online earlier this month, Salt River Pima-Maricopa tribal citizen Leticia Jacobo was jailed in a small town in Iowa.

Jacobo was booked into the Polk County Jail in Des Moines in September on a charge of driving with a suspended license. She was set to walk free on Nov. 11, but what should have been a routine release was thrown into chaos — and delayed — after jail staff flagged her with an ICE detainer that never should have existed.

Jacobo’s sister questioned authorities: “How is she going to get deported if she’s a Native American?”

Both stories reveal a disturbing pattern. Separated by hundreds of miles and different circumstances, they share the same core problem: When federal or local authorities disregard tribal identification, they disregard tribal sovereignty. And when they dismiss our sovereignty, Native people pay the price — in fear, humiliation, and unjust detention.

Native Americans should not have to worry about deportation. We should not have to fear that our children or relatives will be taken into custody because an ICE agent or jail clerk does not recognize a tribal ID. Yet here we are.

These incidents raise a larger question: What training — if any — do ICE agents, local jail staff, and law enforcement officers receive regarding tribal sovereignty and Native citizenship? Tribal IDs are recognized by the federal government. Tribal nations are sovereign governments. That is not up for debate.

And yet, for far too many Native people, recognition seems to depend on whether the person looking at the card has ever been taught what it means.

The federal government cannot continue to preach government-to-government respect with tribes while allowing its own enforcement agencies to undermine that respect on the street or in county jails. Tribal nations should not have to lobby, plead, or litigate to ensure that their citizens are not wrongfully detained.

What happened to Elaine Miles and to Leticia Jacobo are not isolated incidents. In January, Navajo Nation officials reported that more than a dozen Indigenous citizens had been swept up in ICE operations.

Collectively, these incidents should serve as a warning to Native Americans to carry their tribal IDs and even passports, if they have one.

But the burden shouldn't fall on Native people to prove we belong here. The solution lies with federal agencies. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security must immediately:

Issue clear directives that tribal IDs are valid federal identification

Mandate training on tribal sovereignty for all ICE agents and Border Patrol officers

Establish a reporting system for wrongful detentions of tribal citizens

Publicly apologize to Miles, Jacobo and other Natives wrongfully detained

Until these steps are taken, every Native person in this country remains at risk of being told they don't belong in their own homeland.

Our ancestors did not need permission to be here. Neither do we.

Background

These interlocutory appeals arise from extensive litigation between Eleni Napier’s children and grandchild following her death. In these two, Eleni’s son, Eleftherios Napier, challenges three orders that denied his motion for a nonsuit and that held him in contempt for violating an order requiring him to relinquish possession of real property to Margery Cannon, Sean Weaver and the Estate of Eleni Napier. The preliminary question before this court may address the assignments of error, however, is whether it has jurisdiction over these two appeals.

Analysis

On brief, Napier’s appeals challenge five distinct orders: (1) the Feb. 12, 2024, status quo order; (2) the March 19, 2024, order granting defendants’ motion to consolidate; (3) the March 19, 2024, order denying Napier’s nonsuit motion; (4) the March 19, 2024, contempt order that required Napier to vacate the property and held that defendants were “entitled to immediate possession” and (5) the May 13, 2024, contempt order finding that Napier “remains in contempt.”

Two of those five orders were not challenged by either notice of appeal to this court – the February status quo order and the March motion to consolidate. Further, none of the appealed orders is a final order, as the entire matter before the court, including Napier’s estate dispute that began this litigation, still has not been resolved. Thus, jurisdiction over these appeals, if it exists, must be grounded in this court’s limited interlocutory jurisdiction or in its jurisdiction over final civil contempt judgments.

The circuit court’s order denying Napier’s nonsuit motion does not fall within this court’s interlocutory jurisdiction. The order neither “(i) requires money to be paid or the possession or title of property to be changed [n]or (ii) adjudicates the principles of a cause,” so this court does not have jurisdiction under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5).

Napier maintains that this court may review the first and second contempt orders under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5) because they required “possession or title of property to be changed.” The challenged orders may indeed have required a change of possession of property from Napier to defendants. But they did not “involv[e] an equitable claim,” a statutory precursor to this court’s jurisdiction set forth in Code § 17.1-405(A)(5). Instead both the contempt orders were based on and involved defendants’ legal claim of ejectment. Consequently, this court may not consider the contempt orders under Code § 17.1-405(A)(5) because the orders do not “involve” an equitable claim.

Code § 19.2-318 grants jurisdiction to consider an appeal “[f]rom a judgment for any civil contempt of court.” “[A] contempt order is. . . appealable if it adjudicates all issues of guilt and imposes a sentence.” Here, the record demonstrates that both the contempt orders found Napier in civil contempt.

But those findings do not render the contempt orders appealable under Code § 19.2-318, as neither order imposes any sentence or penalty on Napier. Rather, they merely reiterate and clarify the actions Napier needed to take to comply with the court’s earlier status quo order. Thus, they are not appealable orders under Code § 19.2-318.

Appeal dismissed.

Experts across the refugee sector urge the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to use its visit to Australia, starting today, to investigate harmful immigration detention policies that breach human rights.

A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia’s immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group has previously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

· offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

· the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

· the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

· the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

· specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

“After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.”

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said:

“Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.”

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said:

“JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.”

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said:

“Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.”

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said:

“This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.”

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said:

“Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.”

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said:

“Australia’s system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people – some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people.”

“While we know that this news might cause alarm, we have no sense that ICE is planning the kind of activity that we saw Border Patrol do,” said Siembra NC co-director Nikki Marín Baena in a Sunday call with reporters. “The report that we got is that 50 additional agents were going to be deployed to North Carolina for activity starting December 1st.”

The grassroots immigrants rights organization has also had reports that ICE has reserved the same charter flights between Charlotte and Florida’s Jacksonville International Airport as they did last week, scheduled from Dec. 2 to Dec. 6.

Marín Baena declined to talk further about the origin of the information, and NC Newsline was not able to independently confirm it.

Marín Baena noted said the arrests ICE has typically made throughout this year have made it nearly impossible to get to school and work safely. Siembra NC launched the website Ojo Obrero in November to give communities a better sense of where federal enforcement activity has taken place.

“Businesses are being disrupted, classrooms are being disrupted, even people who have become naturalized U.S. citizens are doubting whether they are safe or thinking about what they need to do in the case of these operations,” Marín Baena said.

Many naturalized U.S. citizens and green card holders have started to carry their passports just to go grocery shopping.

“My own parents are naturalized U.S. citizens, and we had to talk about what would happen, what they should do, were they stopped by a border patrol agent,” Marín Baena said.

She believes the anticipated ICE’s operation in Raleigh comes as the result of remarks made by North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall. Last week, Hall told The News & Observer that ICE and the border patrol were doing important work.

“It looks like they’re doing a pretty good job at it right now. And so, we don’t have much to ask, other than to come back,” Hall said.

Siembra is encouraging North Carolinians who have been impacted by the recent detentions to contact Hall’s office.

“We think that they listen to their own campaign contributors. And so, a few key contributors to Speaker Dustin Hall include political action committees with the N.C. Home Builders Association, Duke Energy and Lowe’s Home Improvement,” said Marín Baena. “We are inviting people to write letters and create illustrated cards to Speaker Hall’s top campaign contributors, specifically explaining why children and their parents should not have to live in fear.”

For business owners who have closed because employees are sheltering in place, Siembra NC is inviting people to post placards explaining that they’re closed “Courtesy of Speaker Destin Hall.”

The organization has also suggested that immigrant workers who miss work because they are sheltering in place can send a “Destin Hall Pass” to their employer.

Hall said on social media that he supports the enforcement action and that Gov. Joh Stein should be “more concerned about the safety of our citizens than protecting criminal illegal aliens.” Hall also faulted Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden for blocking previous ICE detainers and putting undocumented immigrants back onto the streets.

“They’re stepping in to clean up his mess and restore safety to the city,” Hall said in a Nov. 17 post on X expressing support for the Border Patrol.

Over the holiday weekend, Homeland Security officials pivoted to focus on the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C.

President Donald Trump announced on Thanksgiving that he intends to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”

The five-day crackdown by Border Patrol in North Carolina resulted in 370 arrests.

Marín Baena said Sunday that many of those detained could eventually see charges dismissed.

“And we actually don’t know, of those 370 people, how many they’ve already had to let go because they were actually U.S. citizens or green card holders and how many they will have to let go because we’ve documented that they were unconstitutional arrests,” she said.

Marín Baena said she hopes that ICE’s plans change and it does not resume indiscriminate arrests in North Carolina in December. But if they do return, she says immigrant advocates are prepared.

“Thousands of people across the state of North Carolina have received training to get their neighbors safely to school, safely to work. And so, we are a little bit more prepared at this moment in time.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20251116_No-ICE-rally_che.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 20:57:13.254151

The lawmakers said they did not know whether last week's Washington Post report was true, and some Republicans were skeptical, but they said attacking survivors of an initial missile strike poses serious legal concerns.

“This rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information that happened. He noted that leaders of the Armed Services Committee in both the House and Senate have opened investigations.

“Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump on Sunday evening while flying back to Washington from Florida, where he celebrated Thanksgiving, confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump also is weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

Trump declined to comment on details of the call, which was first reported by The New York Times.

“I wouldn’t say it went well or badly,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, when asked about the call.

The Venezuelan communications ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the call with Trump.

Turner said there are concerns in Congress about the attacks on vessels that the Trump administration says are transporting drugs, but the allegation regarding the Sept. 2 attack “is completely outside anything that has been discussed with Congress and there is an ongoing investigation.”

The comments from lawmakers during news show appearances come as the administration escalates a campaign to combat drug trafficking into the U.S. On Saturday, Trump said the airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered as “closed in its entirety,” an assertion that raised more questions about the U.S. pressure on Maduro. Maduro's government accused Trump of making a ”colonial threat” and seeking to undermine the South American country’s sovereignty.

After the Post's report, Hegseth said Friday on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.”

""Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict—and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,"" Hegseth wrote.

Trump said on Sunday the administration “will look into” the matter but added, “I wouldn’t have wanted that — not a second strike.” The president also defended Hegseth.

“Pete said he did not order the death of those two men,” Trump said. He added, “And I believe him.”

Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and its top Democrat, Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, said in a joint statement late Friday that the committee “will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”

That was followed Saturday with the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, and the ranking Democratic member, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, issuing a joint statement saying the panel was committed to “providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean.”

“We take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question,” Rogers and Smith said, referring to U.S. Southern Command.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., asked about the Sept. 2 attack, said Hegseth deserves a chance to present his side.

“We should get to the truth. I don’t think he would be foolish enough to make this decision to say, kill everybody, kill the survivors because that’s a clear violation of the law of war,” Bacon said. “So, I’m very suspicious that he would’ve done something like that because it would go against common sense.”

Immigration attorneys and panelists Matthew Gillhouse and Alayna Connolly said immigration law has noticeably changed under the Trump Administration, mentioning a September federal court case which gave Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the power to decide whether detainees can receive bond.

Gillhouse said there is “more corruption” in the immigration law system now.

The Trump Administration also removed Temporary Protective Status (TPS) status from several countries such as Venezuela, Afghanistan and Syria, despite the respective U.S. embassies deeming travel to these countries unsafe. TPS is meant for immigrants who cannot safely return back to their country due to issues such as political turmoil or weather disasters..

Connolly, who does a lot of work with unaccompanied minors, said the administration has also changed immigrants’ rights to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a U.S. immigration policy providing temporary protection from deportation and a work permit for two years at a time for children brought into the U.S. before their 16th birthday.

Previously, kids with Special Immigrant Juvenile status could get Deferred Action while waiting to apply for a green card if they were abused or neglected. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently ruled for DACA renewal applications to be processed, but not new ones.

“Right now, the wait [for Deferred Action] is like four or five years, so one of the major changes is that deferred action is no longer an option for those kids,” Connolly said. “It's also getting harder to terminate or defer cases for kids who are in removal proceedings or deportation proceedings since judges aren't as accepting of the fact that kids have Special Immigrant Juvenile status or have other applications pending in other offices.”

Karen Romo, president of the UW-Madison VOCES chapter, outlined what immigrants can do to stay safe in case of an ICE encounter. She warned immigrants to not open the door, remain silent, not to run or resist, not to sign any documents, not to lie and to film and take photos.

Ashley Hagen, another panelist and Associated Students of Madison vice chair, said they hope to team up with VOCES in the future to teach employees specifically how to support international students. The group is also working on a new task force for academic freedom and freedom of expression in response to the crackdown on protest policy with the Expressive Activity Policy.

Melanie Leyva, College Organizer for Voces de la Frontera, spoke about the Community Defense Network, which trains people to be “verifiers” — people who go to hotline ICE sightings to verify whether the call was real to stop misinformation and fearmongering.

Both Connolly and Gillhouse said the best thing immigrants can do while their rights are uncertain is make a plan.

“One thing that we talk a lot about with people who are coming in for intakes is, what are your goals out of this? Do you want to stay detained by your case or do you want to fight your case?” Connolly said. “Do you want to just try and go back to your home country? Or do you want to try and go somewhere else?”

Gillhouse said the whole process is disheartening.

The Trump administration is extending its anti-immigration agenda beyond US borders. This week, US embassies in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and several Western European nations were instructed to collect and transmit migrant-related crime data in these countries to Washington.

The administration’s stated purpose is to assist US allies in reforming their immigration systems and curbing what the US labels “ mass migration”. In a briefing to explain the action, a US State Department spokesperson called mass migration an “existential threat to Western civilisation and the safety of both the West and the world”.

This request is unprecedented and extremely harmful.

First, it is embedding the Trump administration’s criminalisation and mass deportation of migrants into its diplomatic relations with other countries.

Second, the Trump administration’s directive is perpetuating a false narrative that migrants are to blame for any perceived increase in crime rates.

Empirical research over decades in the US shows migrants do not offend at disproportionate rates, despite persistent political claims.

Nonetheless, the Trump administration continues to escalate its harsh crackdown on migrants under the justification that US cities are under siege. This has enabled the government to take actions that critics say violate international law and curtail domestic civil liberties, including deporting migrants without due process, detaining migrants with no criminal history for long periods, and separating families.

In addition, the US government has also taken lethal military action against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, alleging “narco-terrorists” are flooding the country with drugs.

Australia is described in the US State Department briefing as a “great ally”. The spokesperson explained the US government’s intent in collecting migrant crime data:

“To warn our friends that if you import a rapid number of individuals of any background, but particularly individuals of a culture that’s radically different than Australia’s without any sort of mechanism for diffusing the impact, that can lead to political unrest, that can lead to economic instability.”

In Australia, public inquiries and criminology research have consistently found claims of a link between migrants and crime to be exaggerated and harmful. These studies often call for stricter media regulations on inaccurate crime reporting to avoid scapegoating marginalised communities.

Yet, successive governments have continued to expand their powers to deport migrants under the guise of public safety. This approach is a form of “crimmigration” – when immigration enforcement is incorporated into crime control.

It creates harsher consequences for non-citizens who commit offences, compared to citizens. In addition, many people who have not been convicted of a violent crime – and sometimes no crime at all – have been caught up in these exclusionary processes.

In 2023, the High Court ruled in the NZYQ case that continuing to detain individuals who cannot be removed from Australia is unconstitutional. This resulted in the release of hundreds of non-citizens (some of whom had no convictions, or had convictions and had served their prison sentences) into the community on bridging visas.

The action ignited heated parliamentary debates about a supposed existential threat to Australian society. In many cases, the debates featured divisive language and unsupported claims that are characteristic of the current US administration.

Emergency laws were hastily passed to respond to the situation. These resulted in punitive measures, including a new visa regime with parole-like conditions, new criminal offences with mandatory minimum sentences, and preventative detention modelled on existing counter-terrorism provisions.

These developments show the potential for Trumpian-style immigration approaches to take hold in Australia. The recent anti-immigration rallies across Australia – in addition to the adoption of the “mass migration” terminology – suggest there would be fertile ground for this in parts of society.

But it is not clear to us how enhanced visa cancellations and deportation powers improve community safety.

Every day in Australia, people are processed by the criminal justice system and returned to the community. The government is not taking responsibility for effective crime prevention by targeting non-citizens for punishment and exclusion. This will not make Australia safer. It will only trigger safety concerns for multicultural communities.

A more rigorous and evidence-based approach is needed to address the social determinants that increase the risk of marginalised communities coming into contact with the criminal justice system. This includes systemic racism.

Migration is a feature of our globalising world and does not represent an existential threat to Western civilisation, as claimed in the US State Department.

Retreats into ultra-nationalist rhetoric and the scapegoating of migrants are never the answer.",https://johnmenadue.com/images/Large-group-of-people-forming-Australia-map-and-national-flag.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 23:56:37.863115

On Jan. 13, 2026, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v.

The Supreme Court in May allowed Trump’s transgender military service ban to take effect while litigation continues, after a district court had temporarily blocked it nationwide.

Trump administration lawyers have argued the ban on transgender troops is no different than other policies disqualifying people from military service over medical conditions that can affect military readiness, such as epilepsy or schizophrenia. The policy disqualifies people based on a diagnosis or history of gender dysphoria as defined by psychiatric professionals.

An appeals court heard arguments over the ban in May. The three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit pressed the Trump administration on why the seven transgender servicemembers at the heart of the lawsuit, all of whom are actively serving in the military, should be discharged despite each one individually serving without a problem.

“When we talk about unit cohesion and good order and discipline, that affects everyone” in the military, said Abhishek Kambli, the DOJ lawyer defending the transgender military ban.

Kambli also pushed back on questions about whether the ban was hastily implemented at the start of Trump’s presidency, noting that the Pentagon had built its policy off a similar one put in place under then-Defense Secretary James Mattis during Trump’s first term.

In 2019, the Supreme Court upheld that transgender ban, which allowed transgender troops who were already serving to remain in the military but otherwise included similar reasoning for banning the enlistment of new ones.

Trump’s transgender passport policy rule upheld as ‘historical fact’

The president issued an executive order at the beginning of his term in January, reversing a Biden-era policy that allowed people to select their listed sex on passports, along with allowing an X designation, and reverting to the long-standing policy of listing the biological sex of the passport holder on the document.

The move was met with a lawsuit and a subsequent injunction in April, which blocked the new rule from taking effect, as ordered by U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick.

Kobick claimed in her ruling that the order was “part of a coordinated and rapid rollback of rights and protections previously afforded to transgender Americans” and said that “such targeting of a politically unpopular group runs afoul of our Nation’s constitutional commitment to equal protection.”

The Trump administration appealed the injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which upheld the lower court’s ruling halting the policy, leading the Justice Department to submit the case to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket.

The people who sued the administration over the policy claim it violated the Equal Protection Clause and discriminated against transgender people, while the Justice Department has maintained it is about presenting factual information on government documents.

“Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person’s biological sex—especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President’s constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in his petition to the Supreme Court’s emergency docket.

The justices sided with the administration 6-3, lifting the block on the passport rule while the case continues in lower federal courts. The unsigned majority opinion stated that the policy is not discriminatory, but instead requires the listing of a “historical fact” about the passport holder.

“Displaying passport holders’ sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth—in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment. And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government’s choice to display biological sex ‘lack[s] any purpose other than a bare … desire to harm a politically unpopular group,’” the majority ruling in the Nov. 6 order said.

The ruling marked the second victory on transgender policy issues for the Trump administration this year on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket. It also continued the broader trend of higher courts largely reversing lower courts’ injunctions of Trump policies.

Trump-backed transgender sports laws under review at the Supreme Court in January

While the pair of lawsuits over transgender sports laws before the Supreme Court in January are not directly related to Trump orders, the two state laws at the center of the cases mirror Trump administration policies and have the administration’s backing.

On Jan. 13, 2026, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Little v. Hecox and West Virginia v. B.P.J., where laws in Idaho and West Virginia, respectively, limiting women’s sports to biological women will be under scrutiny. The laws are similar in substance to the president’s February executive order aiming to keep biological men out of women’s sports.

The pair of cases will examine whether the laws either violate the 14th Amendment, as in the Hecox case, or if they violate Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause, as in the B.P.J. case. In Hecox, both the federal district and appeals courts ruled that the law was unconstitutional, while in B.P.J., a federal district court sided with West Virginia in upholding the law, but a federal appeals court later struck down the law.

The Justice Department will receive time to argue in favor of both state laws during oral arguments in January, hoping to notch another legal win with transgender policies via a ruling that upholds the state laws.

“In short, the laws of West Virginia and Idaho place trans-identifying athletes on sports teams on the same valid, biology-based terms as everyone else. That is the definition of equal treatment. It is not gender-identity discrimination at all, much less sex discrimination,” the Justice Department said in a brief to the Supreme Court.

SUPREME COURT TO WEIGH WHETHER STATES CAN TARGET DONOR LISTS

“However else Title IX or the Equal Protection Clause may apply to trans-identifying individuals, they certainly do not require granting these men and boys a preferential exemption from biology-based rules, let alone when that would come at the expense of competitive fairness and safety for women and girls—the very people Title IX was enacted to protect,” the brief continued. “In holding the opposite, the courts below relied on a set of rationales that have no basis in law or fact.”

The Supreme Court has not offered any insight into how it will rule in the transgender sports cases, but it has not handed LGBT activists many wins in recent years. Earlier this year, the high court ruled 6-3, upholding a Tennessee law that banned transgender procedures for minors, a significant loss for LGBT activists.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP21127729510159.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-11-30 17:56:48.207749

By JACK BROOK, REBECCA SANTANA and SARA CLINE Associated Press/Report for America

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Around 250 federal border agents are expected to launch a monthslong immigration crackdown on Monday in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi dubbed “Swamp Sweep.”

The deployment, which aims to arrest 5,000 people, is centered in liberal New Orleans and is the latest federal immigration enforcement operation to target a Democratic-run city as President Donald Trump’s administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign.

Many in the greater New Orleans area, particularly in Latino communities, have been on edge since the planned operations were reported earlier this month, even as Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

Here’s what to know about “Swamp Sweep.”

Border Patrol accused of aggressive tactics in blue cities

Bovino has become the Trump administration’s go-to operative for leading large-scale, high-profile immigration enforcement campaigns. During his operation in Chicago, federal agents rappelled from a helicopter into a residential apartment complex and fired pepper balls and tear gas at protesters.

Federal agents arrested more than 3,200 immigrants during a surge in the Chicago area in recent months, but have not provided many details. Court documents on roughly 600 recent arrests showed that only a handful had criminal records representing a “high public safety risk,” according to federal government data.

Border Patrol, which does not typically operate in dense urban areas or in situations with protesters, has been accused of heavy-handed tactics, prompting several lawsuits. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Chicago accused Bovino of lying and rebuked him for deploying chemical irritants against protesters.

Bovino has doubled down on the efficacy of his agency’s operations.

“We’re finding and arresting illegal aliens, making these communities safer for the Americans who live there,” he said in a post on X.

Louisiana has strict immigration enforcement laws

The Department of Justice has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement and included it on a list of 18 so-called sanctuary cities. The city’s jail, which has been under longstanding oversight from a federal judge, does not cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under most circumstances, and its police department views immigration enforcement as a civil matter outside its jurisdiction.

However, Louisiana’s Republican-dominated Legislature has passed laws to compel New Orleans agencies to align with the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration stance.

One such law makes it a crime to “knowingly” do something intended to “hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts. Anyone who violates the law could face fines and up to a year of jail time.

Additionally, lawmakers expanded the crime of malfeasance in office, which is punishable by up to 10 years in jail, for government officials who refuse to comply with requests from agencies like ICE. It also prohibits police and judges from releasing from their custody anyone who “illegally entered or unlawfully remained” in the U.S. without providing advance notice to ICE.

New Orleans awaits federal agents

In and around New Orleans, some immigration lawyers say they have been inundated with calls from people trying to prepare for the upcoming operation. One immigration lawyer, Miguel Elias, says his firm is conducting many consultations virtually or by telephone because people are too afraid to come in person.

He likens the steps many in the immigrant community are taking to what people do to prepare for a hurricane — hunker down or evacuate. Families are stocking up on groceries and making arrangements for friends to take their children to school to limit how frequently they leave the house, he said.

In the days leading up to Border Patrol’s planned operations, businesses have posted signs barring federal agents from entry and grassroots advocacy groups have offered rights-related trainings and workshops on documenting the planned crackdown.

While New Orleans is famous for its blend of cultures, only around 6.7% of its population of nearly 400,000 is foreign-born, though that rises to almost 10% in neighboring metro areas. That’s still well below the national average of 14.3%, according to U.S. census data.

The city’s Hispanic population ballooned during rebuilding efforts following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and now makes up around 14% of the population, according to census data compiled by New Orleans-based Data Center.

The Pew Research Center estimates 110,000 immigrants who lack permanent legal status were living in Louisiana as of 2023, comprising approximately 2.4% of the state’s population. Most of them are from Honduras.

Amanda Toups, who owns local restaurant Toups Meatery and runs a nonprofit to help feed neighbors in need, said she expects the federal operations to negatively impact the city’s tourism-dependent economy, which supports the rest of Louisiana.

“If you’re scaring off even 5% of tourism, that’s devastating,” she said. “You’re brown and walking around in town somewhere and you could get tackled by ICE and you’re an American citizen? Does that make you want to travel to New Orleans?”

A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia's immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group haspreviously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government's failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: 'After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.'

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said: 'Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people's liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.'

Fr. Brett O'Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: 'JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group's visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.'

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: 'Australia's mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government's obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.'

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: 'This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia's immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.'

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: 'Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.'

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: 'Australia's system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people - some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ellomay Capital Ltd. (NYSE American; TASE: ELLO) (“Ellomay” or the “Company”) , a renewable energy and power generator and developer of renewable energy and power projects in Europe, Israel and USA, today reported the publication in Israel of financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 of Dorad Energy Ltd. (“ Dorad ”), in which Ellomay currently indirectly holds approximately 16.9% through its indirect 50% ownership of Ellomay Luzon Energy Infrastructures Ltd. (“ Ellomay Luzon Energy ”).

On November 30, 2025, Amos Luzon Entrepreneurship and Energy Group Ltd. (the “ Luzon Group ”), an Israeli public company that currently holds the remaining 50% of Ellomay Luzon Energy, which, in turn, holds 33.75% of Dorad, published its quarterly report in Israel based on the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law, 1968. Based on applicable regulatory requirements, the quarterly report of the Luzon Group includes the financial statements of Dorad for the same period.

The financial statements of Dorad as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. Ellomay will include its indirect share of these results (through its holdings in Ellomay Luzon Energy) in its financial results for this period. In an effort to provide Ellomay’s shareholders with access to Dorad’s financial results (which were published in Hebrew), Ellomay hereby provides a convenience translation of Dorad’s financial results .

Dorad Financial Highlights

Dorad’s revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 919.1 million.

Dorad’s operating profit for the three months ended September 30, 2025 – approximately NIS 205.8 million.

Based on the information provided by Dorad, the demand for electricity by Dorad’s customers is seasonal and is affected by, inter alia, the climate prevailing in that season. The months of the year are split into three seasons as follows: summer – June-September; winter – December-February; and intermediate (spring and autumn) – March-May and October-November. There is a higher demand for electricity during the winter and summer seasons, and the average electricity consumption is higher in these seasons than in the intermediate seasons and is even characterized by peak demands due to extreme climate conditions of heat or cold. In addition, Dorad’s revenues are affected by the change in load and time tariffs – TAOZ (an electricity tariff that varies across seasons and across the day in accordance with demand hour clusters), as, on average, TAOZ tariffs are higher in the summer season than in the intermediate and winter seasons. Therefore, the results presented for the quarter ended September 30 , 202 5 , which include the summer month s of July-September , are not indicative of full year results. In addition, due to various reasons, including the effects of the increase in the Israeli CPI impacting interest payments by Dorad on its credit facility and regulatory changes , the results included herein may not be indicative of third quarter results in the future or comparable to third quarter results in the past .

A convenience translation of the financial results for Dorad as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and as of and for each of the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 is included at the end of this press release. Ellomay does not undertake to separately report Dorad’s financial results in a press release in the future. Neither Ellomay nor its independent public accountants have reviewed or consulted with the Luzon Group , Ellomay Luzon Energy or Dorad with respect to the financial results included in this press release.

,Agencies,2025-11-30 17:59:52+00:00,CNN,Multiple arrested as protesters block federal agents at Manhattan garage - CNN,"Emma Tucker, Mark Morales",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/29/us/manhattan-protesters-immigration-garage,"More than a dozen demonstrators were arrested in lower Manhattan on Saturday after their attempts to stop federal agents from conducting immigration and enforcement activities, according to a law enforcement official.
The group of protesters chanted “ICE out of New York” in footage that showed them locking arms to form a barrier blocking federal agents from exiting the garage in their car.
“We won’t let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted,” the spokesperson said.
Tisch criticized the action for putting the public, federal agents and officers at risk, the officials said.
Federal officers at the scene were armed and many of them wore face coverings.","More than a dozen demonstrators were arrested in lower Manhattan on Saturday after their attempts to stop federal agents from conducting immigration and enforcement activities, according to a law enforcement official.

The group of protesters chanted “ICE out of New York” in footage that showed them locking arms to form a barrier blocking federal agents from exiting the garage in their car. Some grabbed planters from the roadway and hurled them at federal vehicles, the official said. The confrontations prompted some officers to deploy what appeared to be pepper spray to subdue demonstrators, the official added.

The incident is the latest in an array of protests that have taken place across the country between federal agents and demonstrators who are fighting against the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration.

Saturday’s protest took place just down the street from Foley Square, where there was a larger demonstration last month. October’s protest came the day after a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street – a popular and highly trafficked area well-known for its street vendors who sell counterfeit designer goods.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said individuals “dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers” after social media posts called “agitators to ICE’s location” in the city.

Publicizing details about the location of ICE agents, DHS said, puts “a target” on their backs, citing an increase in assaults against officers. “We won’t let violent rioters slow us down and anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted,” the spokesperson said.

Ricky Patel, special agent in charge of New York’s Homeland Security Investigations office, apologized in a call with New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch on Saturday for how the enforcement action unfolded, two law enforcement officials briefed on the call said. Tisch criticized the action for putting the public, federal agents and officers at risk, the officials said.

Tisch warned Patel that the displays of force by federal agents intending to cause chaos and disorder on city streets need to stop because they will lead to someone getting hurt, one of the officials familiar with the conversation.

CNN has reached out to HSI for further information.

The incident unfolded just before noon when NYPD officers responded to a 911 call for a “disorderly group” near Chinatown and observed multiple people blocking the street and exits at different locations and “throwing debris,” the agency said.

“They were instructed multiple times to disperse, and they did not comply. As a result, multiple individuals were taken into custody,” the NYPD said in a statement.

The situation remained peaceful at first as the crowd of protesters gathered in front of a closed garage before moving to the corner of the street, chanting “ICE out of New York” and shouting at police officers who did not engage. Federal officers at the scene were armed and many of them wore face coverings.

At one point, the garage opened and a barrier of protesters continued chanting while blocking a vehicle from exiting. The group also created a blockade with piles of wood and cardboard from a construction dumpster and trash bins, according to videos from the scene.

As the car moved out of the garage, protesters chased and shouted at it while police officers tried to stop them and tackled at least one protester who was later released.

City Council member Julie Menin called federal immigration agents’ actions “utterly irresponsible” after the incident in a statement on X.

“Today, ICE threatened the public’s safety yet again — and this time, their actions created a dangerous situation for both the public and our NYPD officers,” she said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-11-29t202917z-1333124512-rc2g6iaq1y2i-rtrmadp-3-usa-migration-new-york.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-11-30 17:56:43.910805

“Going after a large group of people, most of which I think are just trying to live their lives, raise their families, go to work every day, the U.S. government harassing them years later does not make a lot of sense to me,” Kelly told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The Trump administration indefinitely paused immigration from Afghanistan on Wednesday, hours after two West Virginia National Guard members were shot in Washington, D.C. The suspected gunman, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 via a program for those who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in Afghanistan.

One Guard member, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her wounds on Thursday. Another, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition.

President Trump said Wednesday evening that his administration will review the case of every Afghan migrant who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The next day, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said his agency, at the direction of the president, will reexamine green cards held by individuals from 19 countries, including Afghanistan.

The State Department has also paused visas for Afghan nationals in the wake of the shooting.

Kelly said Sunday that while individuals entering the country “should be vetted,” those who assisted the U.S. during the war “provided a valuable service to the United States of America and deserve an opportunity to resettle in our country.”

Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.)","A deadly shooting involving two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., earlier this week rattled officials across the nation, and has spurred an increased presence of federal law enforcement in the nation’s capital and an intensification of President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

West Virginia National Guard members U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe and U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom were both shot. Beckstrom died on Thursday, while Wolfe remained in critical condition on Saturday.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey (R) is expected to discuss the violent event and honor the two service members during an appearance on Fox News’s “The Sunday Briefing.”

In response to the shooting, which occurred blocks from the White House on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said 500 additional National Guard troops will join forces with members already deployed to Washington.

“This will only stiffen our resolve to ensure that we make Washington, D.C., safe and beautiful,” Hegseth told reporters on Wednesday during his trip to the Dominican Republic.

“The drop in crime has been historic. The increase in safety and security has been historic. But if criminals want to conduct things like this, violence against America’s best, we will never back down. President Trump will never back down. That’s why the American people elected him,” he added.

Hours after the shooting, the president said his administration would also place an indefinite pause on immigration from Afghanistan, the country of origin for the suspected shooter.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, entered the United States in September 2021 through the program “Operation Allies Welcome,” the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Wednesday night.

“The suspect who shot our brave National Guardsmen is an Afghan national who was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States … under the Biden Administration,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a Wednesday statement on X.

“I will not utter this depraved individual’s name. He should be starved of the glory he so desperately wants,” she added.

Noem is slated to make appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and ABC’s “This Week,” where she will likely discuss further protocols being implemented in the aftermath of the shooting.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Department of Justice will seek the death penalty against Lakanwal. Bondi is scheduled to make an appearance on Fox News’s “Fox News Sunday.”

Bondi will likely discuss the potential of capital punishment for the suspected shooter in addition to his charges, which include three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed and one count of first-degree murder, according the office of U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro.

White Hose border czar Tom Homan, meanwhile, is set to appear on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” and could provide details on how the shooting is impacting the Trump administration’s moves to restrict immigration.

Amid a rabid political climate, Trump and Hegseth have tussled with Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and five other Democratic lawmakers over a video in which the group urged military members not to abide by “illegal orders.”

Trump described the clip as an act of “sedition” which could be “punishable by death,” sparking outrage from elected officials far and wide while Hegseth said the Pentagon would launch an investigation into Kelly for “serious allegations of misconduct.”

Kelly will likely share his response to the president’s remarks during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He’ll be joined by his colleagues, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), who may also weigh in on Kelly’s feud with the president.

Besides, a group of human rights organisations have filed lawsuit against the administration demanding the employees to be reinstated.
The Guardian quoted one former watchdog saying: “They don’t care about civil rights concerns.
They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants.
“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.""","The US Department of Homeland Security has cut its civil rights watchdog staff, sparking lawsuits and whistleblower complaints over unchecked abuses under Trump administration.

The federal watchdog system at US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) overseeing complaints regarding civil rights violations have been dismantled, which has led to the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity"", according to experts.

According to The Guardian, former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

During President Trump’s second term, hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, known as watchdogs, have been fired. The main watchdog team overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine, The Guardian reported.

A group of expelled watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP). Besides, a group of human rights organisations have filed lawsuit against the administration demanding the employees to be reinstated.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,"" said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.""

In response to reports and complaints of abuses, The Guardian quoted the DHS stating through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin stating that there are “no sub-prime"" conditions in immigration custody in the US.

Last week, McLaughlin issued a statement saying: ““These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.""

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.""

Meanwhile, senior director of GAP Dana Gold pointed out that without a proper oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity"".

The Guardian quoted one former watchdog saying: “They don’t care about civil rights concerns. That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.""

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,"" the former official explained in a telephone interview with The Guardian. “By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.""

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections"", the former official added.",https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-15-2025-08-42cf5b417d1b813c0ad39ebfb532e8fb-16x9.png,N,,2025-11-30 10:57:09.847187

said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition.","CHINATOWN, Manhattan (WABC) -- Immigration advocates, elected officials and community members will rally and speak out on Sunday after multiple people were arrested during an anti-ICE demonstration in Lower Manhattan.

A rally and press conference will be held at Howard Street and Centre Street at 1 p.m. in Chinatown following Saturday's demonstration and arrests.

It all started around noon on Saturday when protesters gathered outside of 209 Centre Street and blocked streets, building and exits.

The area has been a hotbed for Federal law enforcement activity over the last month or so, with ICE cracking down on Canal Street. On Saturday afternoon, protesters converged on a garage apparently used by authorities - and things got heated.

A total of 15 people were arrested. The NYPD says the anti-ICE demonstration quickly started after a social media post.

The demonstration is the latest in an array of protests that have taken place across the nation between federal agents and demonstrators who are fighting against the Trump's administration crackdown on immigration.

The goal was to stop federal immigration vehicles from leaving the parking garage, but instead, protesters ended up in a standoff with the NYPD. Police say when the demonstrators did not disperse, and some started throwing debris, officers began making the arrests.

The arrests are being condemned by the New York Immigration Coalition.

""There's a report right now that we're following up on of an older gentleman and his daughter who were arrested who had nothing to do with anything and were just walking. So, this is a moment for all of us to ask the question of 'does the NYPD protect New York City residents or is it going to continue to harm them through collaborating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement?'"" said Murad Awawdeh, President and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition.

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that protesters gathered after the social media post. The DHS released a statement following Saturday's protest, saying in part, ""When individuals broadcast the location of ICE, they are putting a target on the backs of officers... We are grateful for the NYPD officers that responded to these violent agitators.""

Sources tell Eyewitness News the special agent in charge of the New York Homeland Security Field Office Ricky Patel called NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch later in the afternoon to apologize for what happened.

Tisch told Patel it was 'unacceptable' and put Federal agents and police officers in harm's way -- and if this activity continues someone will get hurt.

Protesters at Saturday's demonstration said they were trying to prevent another large-scale ICE raid, at least two of which were conducted on Canal Street over the past month.

Caracas, which views a large U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean as a pressure campaign to oust President Nicolas Maduro, slammed Trump's warning as a ""colonialist threat.""

""To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers,"" Trump wrote on social media, ""please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.""

He did not elaborate, but after months of deadly U.S. strikes on alleged drug-running boats, speculation is mounting that Washington may launch some sort of military operation on Venezuelan soil.

Trump's warning comes days after U.S. aviation regulators told airlines to use increased caution near Venezuela over the mounting tensions, prompting multiple major carriers to suspend flights.

Maduro's government then issued a ban on the airlines for ""joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government.""

A statement by the Venezuelan foreign ministry called the U.S. president's latest remarks a ""new extravagant, illegal, and unjustified aggression against the people of Venezuela.""

It warned that the airspace disruptions would also mean a halt to repatriation flights of Venezuelan migrants from the United States, a key Trump administration initiative.

Venezuela's military Saturday also conducted exercises along coastal areas, with video broadcast on state TV showing anti-aircraft weapons and other artillery being maneuvered.

'By land'

Though Trump has not publicly threatened to use force to remove Maduro, he said this week that efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking ""by land"" would begin ""very soon.""

Maduro's re-election last year was widely rejected by the international community as fraudulent, while Washington also claims the leftist leader heads an alleged terrorist-designated drug cartel.

A steady buildup of U.S. naval and air assets in the region has seen the world's largest aircraft carrier move to the Caribbean, while American fighter jets and bombers have repeatedly flown off the Venezuelan coast in recent days.

U.S. media reported that, despite the bellicose posturing, Trump and Maduro spoke last week.

The New York Times reported Friday that Trump and Maduro had discussed a possible meeting, while the Wall Street Journal on Saturday said the conversation also included conditions of amnesty if Maduro were to step down.

Amid fears that Trump may launch a major operation in Venezuela, members of U.S. Congress – both Democrats and the president's own Republican Party – have expressed anger that he has not sought legislative approval.

""President Trump's reckless actions towards Venezuela are pushing America closer and closer to another costly foreign war,"" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Sunday on X.

""Under our Constitution, Congress has the sole power to declare war,"" he added.

Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, until recently a close Trump ally, said similarly: ""Reminder, Congress has the sole power to declare war.""

Congress

However, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham cheered on Trump, writing on X that the president's ""strong commitment to end this madness in Venezuela will save countless American lives.""

Trump is also facing congressional pressure over recent media reports that the U.S. military launched a second missile at survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat in September.

Leaders of both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have released separate statements saying they would be investigating the strike, which legal experts say could amount to a war crime.

With Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, the Trump administration has so far largely escaped probing of its controversial anti-trafficking campaign.

Since the operation began in September, at least 83 people have been killed in the Caribbean Sea and the Eastern Pacific Ocean.

Washington has yet to release evidence that the vessels it targeted were used to smuggle drugs or posed a threat to the United States, and experts say the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2025/11/30/thumbs/800x531/414161.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 11:57:30.056205

The vote comes one week after hundreds of people filled city council chambers to urge Salem leaders to take action against what they called unconstitutional and fearmongering ICE sweeps.

Communities across Oregon are reeling from mass immigration arrests.

After at least 35 people were arrested in Woodburn by ICE in late October, some residents in the 60% Hispanic city said they are afraid to leave their homes, hesitant to buy groceries and are questioning whether to go to work. Businesses reported as much as an 80% drop in customer traffic.

Woodburn City Council declared a state of emergency on Nov. 21 in response to the impact.

At least 24 people were arrested by ICE in Salem on Nov. 11, the highest one-day total in Salem in many years.

Dozens of people testified about racial profiling, violence and uncertainty wrought by ICE.

A vote brought forth by Councilor Linda Nishioka to reaffirm Salem as an inclusive city and its status as a sanctuary city passed in a 7-2 vote.

A separate motion from Councilor Vanessa Nordyke to have City Manager Krishna Namburi craft a declaration for a vote during the Dec. 1 meeting passed in a 6-3 vote, with Mayor Julie Hoy and Councilors Deanna Gwyn and Shane Matthews voting no.

The declaration condemns the unconstitutional use of ICE sweeps, especially when politically motivated and done without due process. It calls on Oregon's members of Congress to enact legislation to protect immigrant and vulnerable communities like mask bans and identification requirements.

The declaration would authorize the following actions:

Coordination with community partners, including immigrant rights advocates, legal services providers, educational institutions, local business owners, neighborhood leaders, and faith leaders, to support programs for communication and outreach for the emergency impacts of federal immigration enforcement.

Consider implementation of legally defensible programs, policies and resources that protect and support employees and the community.

Provide training to city employees on city and state sanctuary policies and laws, including protocols for employees to follow in the event federal immigration authorities appear at city facilities.

Regular review of programs and services to identify ways to further enhance the goals of this declaration and implement best practices and policies for communities impacted by immigration.

Provide periodic reports to the council regarding the implementation of this declaration.

Some requests from the public, including calls for ""sanctuary zones"" at schools and the suspension of Flock camera use that could go to federal officials, were not included in the resolution.

City officials said the city does not have authority over Salem-Keizer Public Schools to create sanctuary zones. Police officials said they do not use Flock systems and instead use an automated license plate recognition program that is not shared with federal immigration enforcement agencies.

Other Salem City Council agenda items

A vote on authorizing Namburi to execute a cooperative improvement agreement with the Oregon Department of Transportation for the Center Street Bridge project.

A presentation on updates to the Center Street Seismic Retrofit Project.

Japanese American groups have filed an amicus brief contesting President Trump’s recent invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a law that was also used to justify the imprisonment of Japanese Americans.","From the passenger seat of a sky blue Prius, Amy Oba craned her neck to get a look at the federal detention center, a hulking tower surrounded by a black chain-link fence and laced with barbed wire. On a recent evening, she was on patrol, part of a group of Japanese Americans who are keeping a watchful eye on the actions of immigration agents in Los Angeles.

“I definitely think about my family when we organize, when we go out on patrols, because that could have been my family in prison,” said Ms. Oba, 33. “It’s just a difference of what, like, 80 years?”

During World War II, Ms. Oba’s grandparents were among the more than 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were forced by the federal government to live for years in remote, hastily constructed internment camps across the West.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, backed by the Supreme Court, treated the Japanese Americans as national security threats because of their ethnicity. Families left behind communities, businesses, homes and even pets. Some of them never returned. It wasn’t until the Reagan administration that the government apologized and said it would pay compensation to families who were affected.

Now, as the Trump administration carries out its immigration crackdown, Japanese Americans see chilling similarities to what their families experienced.

The federal government’s current efforts have focused on arresting and deporting Latinos who don’t have legal status in the United States. That contrasts with the situation in the 1940s, when most of the Japanese Americans held in detention camps were U.S. citizens.

But to many Japanese Americans, the images of uniformed federal agents ushering people onto buses, the mass detentions and the dehumanizing language used by government officials stir collective memories of the trauma faced by their own parents and grandparents.

Lisa Doi, 34, a board member of the Japanese American Citizens League’s chapter in Chicago, said that people who showed up to a recent event to connect community members with local rapid response networks were already seeing the parallels.

Japanese Americans tend to support Democrats at the polls and did so in the 2024 election, according to AAPI Data, a research organization focused on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. But this year, some have taken more concrete action to oppose the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

Japanese American groups have filed an amicus brief contesting President Trump’s recent invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a law that was also used to justify the imprisonment of Japanese Americans. They have denounced as a disgrace the government’s mass detention of immigrants at Fort Bliss, a former internment camp for Japanese Americans in Texas.

As a surge of federal agents put immigrant communities on edge in Chicago, Japanese American organizers marched, documented arrests and lined streets around schools to help protect parents who were afraid to pick up their children.

In Dublin, Calif., near San Francisco, camp survivors and Japanese taiko drummers rallied in July to oppose the proposed reopening of a federal prison to hold immigrants.

The alliance between Americans of Japanese and Mexican descents has been particularly strong in Los Angeles. Both include people who came to the United States with very little, worked as landscapers, cooks and farmers, and settled in urban neighborhoods where they were confined by redlining.

Ms. Oba and her partner, Nicole Suzuki, are part of Nikkei Progressives, a group founded by Japanese American activists in 2016 to push for immigrant rights. The group has raised money for undocumented immigrants affected by Los Angeles’s devastating wildfires and has served as advocates for migrants held at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Adelanto, a desert community about 80 miles outside Los Angeles.

And as the Trump administration stepped up immigration raids across Southern California this year, the group started patrolling.

Ms. Suzuki, 28, said it was important to make sure that agents know that residents are watching what they do. On their weekly drives, Ms. Oba and Ms. Suzuki look out for unmarked vans, trucks with dark tinted windows or agents gathering behind the federal detention center.

“I think a lot of people lose hope that they have the power, that they can do anything about what’s happening,” Ms. Suzuki said. “But no — they could drive around their neighborhood every now and then and keep an eye out.”

Japanese American groups have also rallied against what they say is the Trump administration’s attempt to erase their history.

To Latino immigrant rights leaders, Japanese Americans have been both allies and examples.

Angelica Salas, the executive director of CHIRLA, one of the leading immigrant rights groups in the state, cited stories of Mexican Californians watching over the property of their Japanese neighbors. There was also the case of Ralph Lazo, a Mexican American teenager who was the only known person who wasn’t of Japanese ancestry to report to the camps, in solidarity with his classmates.

Now, Ms. Salas said, Japanese American groups have been returning the support through rapid response networks and efforts to educate the public about their history.

“They remind everybody that we aren’t enemies. We are just people living our lives, running businesses,” she said.

That has held true, even when Little Tokyo was caught in the middle of clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers.

In June, when demonstrators were protesting immigration raids and Mr. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, law enforcement officers pushed them into Little Tokyo, which is right next to City Hall and the federal detention center. While the vast majority of the protesters were peaceful, when night fell, vandals broke windows and ransacked stores. Buildings, including the Japanese American museum, were heavily tagged.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/17/multimedia/00-nat-japanese-americans-01-qklc/00-nat-japanese-americans-01-qklc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:01:09.661033

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration.
Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.
“A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.
But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website.","The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

A group of fired watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP), and a coalition of human rights organizations sued the administration, demanding the employees be reinstated. There is deepening concern that a system of oversight that was already weak is now hanging by a thread, even as criticism surges over treatment of detainees in the ballooning immigration jail network.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.”

The DHS has repeatedly, through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, insisted when asked about reports and complaints of abuses that there are “no sub-prime” conditions in immigration custody in the US.

But Dana Gold, a senior director of the GAP, which is working with those behind the whistleblower complaint, echoed Enriquez’s warning.

Without a robust oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity”, she said.

The second Trump administration early on fired hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, typically known as watchdogs.

This included at the DHS. The main watchdog team there overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine. This despite there being about 550 investigations that were active and alleging serious civil rights violations by DHS officials and contractors, including inside immigration detention centers.

Cases that were active when Trump returned to office include civil rights officials then in post investigating allegations of civil and human rights abuses, according to CRCL documents that were previously public, original complaint records submitted to the CRCL and the whistleblower disclosure, reviewed by the Guardian. Among the cases, were the following allegations:

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document. This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint.

This last one, into Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents for his pro-Palestinian activism, was one of the final investigations launched before the mass firing of civil rights watchdog officials in March.

The status of these investigations, and hundreds more, is unknown. Enquiries by the Guardian to the DHS last week about the above specific cases and the many others previously understood to be active elicited no response.

However, in response to requests for comment by the Guardian, also submitted to DHS last week, McLaughlin issued a statement, saying: “These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.”

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.

“CRCL and OIDO, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, regularly inspect detention facilities, document conditions in accord with facility standards, investigate detainee complaints, and issue recommendations to ICE and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] when appropriate.”

An investigation by the Guardian based on interviews with five recently dismissed DHS civil rights officials, hundreds of pages of documents, and interviews with immigration attorneys, has found that the already limited oversight practiced within the DHS prior to January 2025 now appears almost nonexistent.

Of the nine people now working at the CRCL, one is its acting officer, installed in May, Troup Hemenway, a former adviser to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint for conservative government.

Congress originally tasked the three offices, including CRCL, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) and the Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS), with oversight at DHS. The watchdog bodies process complaints, initiate investigations and provide guidance to DHS agencies in various areas of interest.

Now, those operations have seemingly been halted, or at least significantly slowed.

In recent months, the former DHS officials who have filed the whistleblower complaint have watched as the Trump administration has targeted political adversaries, expelled immigrants to a foreign prison, allowed officials to arrest immigrants at court appearances, encouraged officers to wear face coverings during arrests and targeted people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal record.

Few know much about what is happening behind closed doors inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and at secretive holding facilities.

Former DHS employees the Guardian spoke with, who were dismissed from their positions at CRCL, spoke with the Guardian on condition of anonymity to discuss matters more freely and avoid retaliation.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration. “That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.”

One morning in late March, top DHS officials emailed employees at the three oversight offices, ordering them to stop working. Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.

A coalition of immigrant rights organizations sued the administration in Washington, declaring the cuts illegal and demanding all oversight employees be reinstated.According to a declaration filed by a top DHS official, , nearly every single employee from the offices was fired, including 147 employees at the CRCL, 118 at the OIDO and 46 at CIS.

The Trump administration wants “no oversight into what they are doing,” said Enriquez from RFK Human Rights.

Following the lawsuit, the DHS walked back its claims that the offices were being abolished. Instead they told the federal judge they reduced the number of staff in order to “refocus” the offices and “create more efficient processes.” The internal oversight work was continuing, the DHS said, arguing the lawsuit should be tossed.

Throughout litigation, the administration has put out various staffing figures, most recently that only nine people total, including Hemenway, now worked at CRCL. Five of them are “contract” investigators, meaning that as of August, there were only two full-time CRCL investigators. Fifteen additional contractors are also reportedly at CRCL, according to the DHS court declaration, exclusively focusing on internal Equal Employment Opportunity cases for DHS employees.

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,” the former official explained in a telephone interview with the Guardian.

“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.”

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections”, the former official added.

Gold, at the GAP, said of the whistleblowers she is working with: “The idea that getting rid of basically every employee with institutional knowledge and replacing them with just a few – in the wake of daily multiple examples of the kinds of things that CRCL would have dealt with – is just deeply disturbing to them.”

Oversight at the DHS “is a guardrail that has been deliberately decimated to make sure that sand is not put in the gears of executive branch priorities”, Gold added.

Many CRCL investigations focused on complaints inside ICE detention centers, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse and deaths in custody, the whistleblower complaint said. Now, the Trump administration is further expanding its immigration detention network.

“ I don’t think they care about the conditions of these facilities. I think they’re just trying to round up as many people as they can and get rid of them without any due process and without any regard for conditions,” said the former official, who worked on CRCL investigations into allegations of abuse at several facilities.

A third former official, speaking to the Guardian, warned of dangers for immigrants targeted by ICE.

“If there isn’t oversight that keeps pace, the potential for real danger is great,” that former official said, adding: “You are left to ICE policing itself.”

In 2023, the CRCL’s compliance branch received 3,104 complaints and investigated 25% of them, according to a report to congress.

“I don’t know if they’re actually reading and investigating those complaints or doing anything with the complaints,” said the former CRCL official quoted first in this report.

Sophia Genovese, an immigration attorney and faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center, has submitted over 100 complaints to CRCL.

“Nine people can’t cover a detention center, much less an entire country – especially with so many new detention centers popping up left and right,” she said. “It’s laughable that they think that they can do anything with so few staff.”

As the Trump administration ramps up its enforcement operations, Genovese is seeing an increase of cases of ICE threatening physical violence on immigrants, pressuring them to self-deport – an allegation CRCL would have likely investigated.

“I’m getting referrals every day from people who have family members who are picked up, detained and are being coerced into signing deportation orders,” said Genovese.

Immigrant advocates for years were already frustrated with CRCL’s limited powers. Typically after an investigation, CRCL officials make recommendations to DHS agencies to improve their civil rights practices but can rarely mandate changes.

“Structurally speaking, the way congress set up the agency, there were some real weaknesses,” said Enriquez from RFK. But he argues that any oversight, no matter how limited, is significantly better than no oversight. “A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.

That appears highly unlikely in the current climate.

Gold said of CRCL: “Even with its weaknesses at some level, it did investigations, it could mitigate problems and it provided a really important oversight function – also in terms of just getting information to Congress to do [additional] oversight. And without that, there’s just a blank check for impunity.”

CRCL always used to publish memos about completed investigations and those they were initiating, which, Genovese said, journalists and attorneys found valuable in helping reveal conditions inside ICE detention centers and other problems within the DHS.

But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website. (The Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, later published the majority of the CRCL public records after they were scrubbed by the DHS).

“It’s a real breakdown in the rule of law. It’s really concerning,” said one former CRCL official. “It’s very upsetting.”

The main avenue of resort now is public protest and legal action, Genovese said.

“We’re seeing really incredible acts of bravery by members of the public,” she said. “That’s been helpful at preventing detention in some ways, but also educating the public about the horrors of detention.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1c63b71514e711a2e8ffb7f1e3436c263c00c47/151_0_2006_1605/master/2006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f03ffccfa72ce3f3c2eeb36dc6e49148",N,,2025-11-30 08:01:14.134933

For one thing, his governing strategy has been all but unprecedented. Most presidents who have just won an election are forced to choose whether they want to cash in their political chips to get big things done or build up political capital for future elections. Trump has chosen the first fork in the road with an audacious policy agenda and massive expansions of presidential power. But at the same time, he’s trying to make future elections more promising not by improving his lagging popularity but by rigging the landscape via aggressive gerrymandering and efforts to manipulate voting rules. Because nearly all his power grabs have drawn legal challenges, much of his legacy remains up in the air, slowly moving through the federal court system toward reckonings in a Supreme Court that Trump has done much to shape.

What’s made this situation especially hard to figure out is the Supreme Court’s new habit of relying heavily on its “shadow docket.” This involves temporary rulings on emergency petitions, sometimes from the administration as it seeks relief from lower-court judges who have thwarted Trump’s high-speed agenda, and sometimes from Trump opponents who are trying to slow down the locomotive of unparalleled executive actions. So the state of play on any given issue depends on the interplay of both temporary and regular Supreme Court decisions with the implications of “shadow docket” rulings often clouded by terse orders with no explanation of the legal reasoning. It’s quite a quagmire.

The most familiar set of issues facing the Supreme Court, mostly because litigation on them began early in 2025, involves assertions of presidential authority over matters normally consigned to Congress, the courts, or independent federal agencies. Typically, the administration has found some obscure emergency power intended for situations like wars or natural disasters and asserted the president’s exclusive right to determine when and to what it applies. Accordingly, in 2025 Trump has declared nine separate “emergencies” that give him and his hirelings extraordinary powers over tariffs, exclusion or deportation of refugees, and energy policy, among other things.

Reinforcing these claims of executive preeminence has been a general argument, to which Supreme Court conservatives are receptive, that the president deserves great deference to his actions in any area affecting foreign relations or national security. Trump’s lawyers, for example, claim tariffs are so entwined with diplomacy that restricting his ability to obtain leverage through “trade deals” would hamstring his ability to conduct foreign relations. Similarly, they argue that border control and the immigration policies necessary to maintain it are inherently national-security matters where Congress and the courts should give the chief executive maximum leeway.

Big upcoming Supreme Court decisions involving executive authority include (1) a batch of tariffs cases that will determine whether the centerpiece of Trump’s economic policy will stand or fall; (2) appeals from lower-court decisions restricting the president’s power to arbitrarily deploy military units in U.S. cities; (3) a welter of immigration cases testing the administration’s power to cancel refugee status for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deport “illegals” to countries other than their own, and cancel “birthright citizenship” for children of undocumented immigrants born in this country; and (4) a test of the outer limits of presidential power over executive agencies, especially those created to be independent, like the Federal Reserve Board, which Trump wants to control personally.

In a very real sense, the Supreme Court will determine in the coming weeks and months whether a president determined to act outside traditional executive boundaries can or cannot be meaningfully restrained by Congress or the judiciary. As Christian Farias put it in New York, if the Court acts quickly and decisively in Trump’s favor, it could in just three months effectively make him king.

Aside from the scope of Trump’s powers, the Supreme Court will also have a lot to say about their duration by granting or denying him the power to rig the midterms and perpetuate Republican trifecta control of the federal government. That could make the difference between the Trump 2.0 train roaring toward the end of his presidency at full throttle and a chastened lame-duck president facing obstacles to his reign from a Congress partially controlled by the opposition.

Most immediately, the Supreme Court will decide whether a lower-court decision scrapping his first and most audacious gerrymandering bid will stand. This summer, Trump abruptly ordered Texas to conduct a rare mid-decade remapping of U.S. House districts to help insulate the GOP majority from the midterm electorate. Texas complied, but its new map giving Republicans five new districts was based on a blatantly racial justification provided by Trump’s Justice Department, which led to the adverse judicial ruling on November 18. Now Trump’s lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to intervene and reimpose the gerrymandered map on grounds that the lower court acted too late in the election cycle. The Court will also review a Justice Department suit claiming that the retaliatory Democratic gerrymander approved by California voters on November 4 was unconstitutionally racial in its motivations. If it chose to rule for Trump in both cases, the Supreme Court could swing the midterm map by as much as ten net House seats, aside from its effect on other gerrymandering disputes that might arise. That could be enough to protect the GOP majority in the House.

But the biggest blow to the midterm electorate’s ability to restrain Trump could come from a different case involving Louisiana, in which the Supreme Court has been invited to invalidate the minority vote rights guarantees in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. That case has been argued and reargued before the Court, and a decision could arrive at almost any time. If the Supreme Court acts quickly and sweeps away what’s left of the VRA, it could produce a wave of instant gerrymanders in Republican-controlled states that would be free to dismantle House (and state legislative) districts designed to give Black and Latino citizens some minimal representation. In turn, that could tilt the national map far enough in the GOP’s direction that only a major Democratic wave could dislodge Trump’s total control of Washington.

It’s generally assumed that Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas will give Trump virtually everything he wants and that Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson will dissent powerfully. But three of the remaining Justices (Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) owe their lifetime appointments to Trump, and Chief Justice John Roberts is the jurist who placed this president above the law in last year’s big immunity case.

If the Supreme Court’s conservative majority does give the 47th president a helping hand in expanding and maintaining his power, Democrats might be forced to reconsider their current tendency to subordinate “threat to democracy” warnings to crass material considerations in their midterm messaging. Yes, Trump’s economic policies and broken promises on “affordability” are damaging his and his party’s popularity significantly. But if he’s given royal authority to run wild and the ability to overcome any popular backlash at the polls, then the bad times could continue to roll for at least three more years.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2dc/b98/061454f56aebc966ac4f7183043a362dcc-supremecourt-trump.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 08:01:21.536705

I think [federal agents] knew they encountered people that weren't gonna take their BS,” he said.","In the middle of the night on Sept. 30, Eboni Watson heard an unusual buzzing sound.

The noise came from 10 drones and three Black Hawk helicopters, Watson says, which dropped armed men on neighbouring rooftops in Chicago's South Shore neighbourhood. On the ground, Watson saw agents deploy out of unmarked cars and rental vans.

“It was bringing people outside because it was such a disturbance. You have people that was thinking UFOs and stuff was landing,” Watson, who livestreamed the situation, told CBC News.

But it wasn't an alien invasion. It was a federal immigration raid involving hundreds of agents.

Eleanor McMullen-Webster was among those arrested.

“When I opened that door, I tell you, I saw that little red light, and that gun was right in my face,” McMullen-Webster told CBC.

Federal agents handcuffed the 64-year-old retiree and her husband, she says, directing them into an apartment where Venezuelan migrants were lined up against a wall.

The raid on the South Shore apartment complex was part of a larger initiative by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to capture the “worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in Illinois, according to a press release. Codenamed Operation Midway Blitz, the mission was to capture undocumented migrants allowed to “roam free on American streets” due to the state’s sanctuary policies.

That night, authorities arrested 37 immigrants, mostly Venezuelans, though none have been charged.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) says two of them are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan transnational criminal group the U.S. designated a terrorist organization in February, but didn't release names. One of those men denied any association with the organization in an interview with ProPublica.

After being held for more than an hour, McMullen-Webster and her husband were released, without an explanation.

“I felt this small,” said the Chicago resident, still furious at the “disrespectful” way she was treated.

President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has faced sharp criticism, including from former president Barack Obama and Pope Leo, who is from Chicago. Both admonished the vilification of migrants.

But the idea of “saving” Chicago has been ongoing for years.

While running for president in 2016, Trump frequently invoked the city’s violent crime rate, calling Chicago a “war zone” and saying minorities in “inner cities” were “living in hell.”

Two weeks before his assassination, MAGA influencer Charlie Kirk — a Chicago native — spoke out in favour of Trump's efforts to apprehend ""illegal criminals” trying to “take over” the U.S. “from within.” At Kirk’s memorial, Trump said one of the last things Kirk said to him was, “Please, sir, save Chicago.”

“We're going to do that,” Trump told the crowd. “We're going to save Chicago from horrible crime.”

But in the wake of Operation Midway Blitz, Chicagoans themselves are divided over who the criminals are — and who is ultimately responsible for keeping their city safe.

Troops sent to ‘straighten out’ Chicago

The helicopter-assisted ICE raids took place three weeks after Trump threatened the city in a post on Truth Social. It included an image of him as a military commander with the caption, “I love the smell of deportations in the morning,” a reference to the 1979 war film Apocalypse Now.

Trump’s rocky relationship with Chicago goes back years. In 2014, he built a 20-foot-tall steel sign spelling out his name on the city’s Trump Tower. The move drew widespread backlash, including from then-mayor Rahm Emanuel.

As president, Trump blasted the city’s tolerance of illegal immigration, saying violence in Chicago was “worse than some of the places … where you have wars going on.” He frequently took aim at local officials on social media, threatening to “send in the Feds” in January 2017.

Crime in “sanctuary” cities has been a focal point for the second Trump administration. After deploying the National Guard in August to address the “complete and total lawlessness” in Washington, D.C., he again vowed to send federal troops to “straighten out” Chicago.

Robert Reich, a former U.S. secretary of labour, suggested it's all a concerted effort to suppress the vote in the 2026 mid-term elections.

“He is saying to himself and maybe others quietly, this is a way to intimidate [residents],” Reich said. “‘If they're just afraid to be very public in any way, then I win, because they're not going to vote.’”

‘Absolute betrayal’ of American people

The force used by federal agents in the South Shore apartment complex is far from isolated.

In Evanston, Ill., a car was following a vehicle of DHS officers when agents slammed on the brakes, resulting in a crash. While arresting the activists, one of whom was severely beaten by officers, an immigration agent threatened to shoot a civilian filming the arrests.

“I believe that they're acting with total authority, but without any sort of oversight at all, and they should be held accountable for their actions,” said local resident David Brooks, who had a pistol pointed at him.

Michael Rodriguez, a representative for Chicago’s Little Village neighbourhood, characterized the immigration raids as an “absolute betrayal” of the U.S. Constitution and the American people.

“This is a disgrace to our country, to our legacy,"" he said. ""It will live in infamy.”

Democratic Chicago committeeman Raymond Lopez says the violent nature of the raids have made his constituents — many of whom are long-term undocumented, mostly Mexican immigrants — fearful of going outside.

‘Black Americans vs. brown illegals’

Despite growing opposition, some Chicago residents have welcomed Trump’s aggressive actions as a way to keep the city safe.

“When you place unvetted gang members into our buildings amongst us with our kids, then you put us in danger. And that's what we have seen in our communities,” said Danielle Carter-Walters, vice-president of grassroots conservative movement Chicago Flips Red.

The current violent crime rate in Chicago is down about 40 per cent from 2023, which had the most reported incidents in the last decade, city data shows. Crime across Illinois has followed a similar downward trend, though rates of homicide and rape remain higher than the national average.

Ramona Paravola, operations manager of Chicago Flips Red, says poor, often Black neighbourhoods were forced to absorb newcomers under the Biden administration — including more than 30,000 from Texas.

“They are not spreading the load out,” said Paravola, who believes politicians knew that adding migrant shelters to an “affluent white neighbourhood” would face greater backlash.

Seeing migrants receive help that Black Chicagoans have been demanding for years is another source of resentment. In 2024, for example, city officials invested more than $300 million US to address the migrant crisis — money, they say, should have been invested into their communities first.

“How does that happen when they told us that they didn't have these [funds]?” said Carter-Walters.

“It's not Black and brown people. It's Black Americans versus brown illegals,” said Paravola.

Paravola, whose husband is a retired Chicago police officer, says she supports pathways to citizenship for “Dreamers” who come to America, including undocumented migrants without violent criminal records.

“We're not racist,” she said. “We're just intelligent enough to see people as individuals, or as individual communities, and not Black and brown as a big lump.”

ICE facility ‘gates of hell,’ says pastor

Presbyterian minister Rev. David Black has witnessed the violent methods used against immigrants employed against protesters at the ICE detention facility in nearby Broadview, Ill.

Black was praying for ICE agents and calling on them to “repent” on Sept. 19 when officers on the roof of the facility shot him in the face, head and body with pepper balls.

Immediately after, video shows Black shouting, “God is watching you — and you will pay for this!”

“It seems like they've been testing out how much they can get away with … as they suppress free speech and try to dismantle the civil society of a major American city,” Black told CBC News.

When Kat Abughazaleh, a congressional candidate, first visited the Broadview facility for a vigil in the summer, she said ICE “didn’t even board up the windows."" Since then, she has witnessed the “one-sided violence” by ICE agents escalate.

“People were dragged, beaten,” she said.

Abughazaleh, a journalist, was thrown to the ground herself at multiple rallies. In one video that went viral, Abughazaleh can be heard hitting the asphalt after being shoved by immigration officers.

“They shot pepper bullets at the sidewalk and said, ‘Your First Amendment rights are on the sidewalk,’” she said.

Meanwhile, Sister JoAnn Persch, who worked with migrants in the Chicago area for 40 years, was repeatedly denied access to provide spiritual care to detainees at the Broadview facility. Authorities cited “safety reasons.”

“All these years I've been right with immigrants, I've never felt they were going to attack me and surely I was not going to attack them,” said the 91-year-old nun, who was not allowed inside to visit migrants during a Nov. 1 mass.

Earlier this month, the spiritual coalition Persch was a part of sued the federal government for what they allege are violations of First Amendment rights to religious freedom.

Persch, a Sister of Mercy who got a state law passed in 2009 to allow pastoral workers into immigration facilities, said the situation made her “extremely sad.”

“There's just so many human rights being violated in that building. So we just have to keep working for human and religious rights,” said Persch, who died on Nov. 14.

Border Patrol commander ‘outright lying’

Two months since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz, federal authorities and Chicago locals still find themselves at odds on whether the mission to “save” Chicago has succeeded.

At the end of October, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem boasted that agents “arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens including rapists, murderers and gang members” since September.

But a Chicago Tribune analysis of government records found that of 614 arrestees whose names were released by the Department of Justice, only 16 — or 2.6 per cent — had criminal histories.

U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has defended the agency’s tactics, asserting in an interview that their “operations are airtight — legal, ethical and moral.”

But the widespread use of force has led to judicial scrutiny of the government’s tactics in Chicago. Bovino was subpoenaed to appear in federal court about his agents’ use of force against protesters in the Chicago area, and in a 233-page ruling released Nov. 20, Judge Sara L. Ellis identified “inconsistencies” in his testimony.

Ellis said Bovino “appeared evasive” throughout his deposition, either providing “cute” responses to the plaintiffs’ questions or “outright lying.”

The judge wrote that videos contradicted Bovino’s claims that his agents’ use of force was justified.

Ellis’s ruling prevents federal agents from using tear gas against people who do not pose a threat. A federal appeals court paused the injunction on Nov. 19, calling it “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.”

DHS did not respond to multiple requests from CBC News to interview Bovino.

U.S. Border Patrol agents ultimately left Chicago in mid-November. Committeeman Rodriguez believes resistance efforts in the city were a large factor.

“It wasn't just the weather. I think [federal agents] knew they encountered people that weren't gonna take their BS,” he said. “We know what makes us safe. We keep us safe. Not Donald Trump.”

But Abughazaleh believes this fight won't be “over” for years.

“We're living in a horror movie,” she said. “A lot of our most important systems are being razed to the ground. But that does mean that we have an opportunity to build something better.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/b0caa8fa-b7f5-437a-ba4f-d364e5e0c314,1764351415388/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C310%2C5961%2C3353%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-30 06:56:26.935725

The Supreme Court of Ohio’s decision in State ex rel. Brown v. Columbiana County Jail, 2025-Ohio-5280, is a significant follow-up to its earlier 2024 opinion in the same matter. While the first decision granted a limited writ of mandamus compelling the Columbiana County Sheriff’s Office to obtain certain jail records from private contractors, this second opinion addresses two distinct issues:

whether the relator, an incarcerated requester, is entitled to statutory damages under Ohio’s Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43; and

whether the sheriff should be held in contempt and sanctioned for alleged noncompliance with the court’s limited writ.

Relator Terry Brown, an inmate at Belmont Correctional Institution, sought records relating to the Columbiana County Jail’s intake and booking policies, personnel, and records-retention policies. The jail is operated under contracts with private administrators—Correctional Solutions Group, L.L.C. (“CSG”) and Community Education Centers, Inc./GEO Group, Inc. (“GEO”). Brown initially obtained a limited writ ordering the sheriff to obtain specified records from these private entities and to certify nonexistence if records could not be found.

After the sheriff filed a notice of compliance, Brown moved for contempt and sanctions and also sought statutory damages. The majority opinion (DeWine, J.) denies both statutory damages and contempt. Justice Brunner concurs in part and dissents in part, agreeing that contempt is unwarranted but arguing that Brown should receive statutory damages.

The decision clarifies:

the evidentiary burden for statutory damages, particularly when requests are transmitted by a third party or by non-qualifying means such as fax;

the unresolved status of non-attorney “agents” transmitting requests on behalf of others;

the standards governing contempt for noncompliance with a public-records writ where third-party contractors hold the records; and

the continuing role of the quasi-agency doctrine in accessing records in the hands of private contractors, even as the court expresses skepticism about suing only the public office rather than the contractor directly.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Procedural Posture

In Brown v. Columbiana Cty. Jail, 2024-Ohio-4969, the court granted a limited writ of mandamus ordering the Corrections Division of the Columbiana County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff Brian McLaughlin (“the sheriff”) to:

produce specific requested records to Brown; or

certify that such records do not exist.

The court required the sheriff to seek and obtain records from CSG and GEO, the private jail operators, under a quasi-agency theory of public-records jurisdiction. It specifically deferred ruling on statutory damages until the sheriff complied with the writ.

After the sheriff filed a notice of compliance, Brown responded with:

a motion, later amended, for contempt and sanctions, alleging noncompliance; and

a request for statutory damages under R.C. 149.43(C).

B. Holding

The court holds:

Statutory damages denied. Brown failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that he transmitted his public-records requests in one of the statutorily qualifying ways (hand delivery, certified mail, or electronic submission) such that statutory damages are available.

Contempt and sanctions denied. Brown did not show that the sheriff disobeyed or resisted the court’s limited writ, as required for contempt under R.C. 2705.02(A).

C. Key Doctrinal Points

Transmission requirement for statutory damages: Even when a requester ultimately receives some records after litigation, statutory damages are not automatic. The requester bears the burden to prove proper transmission by a qualifying method.

Fax is not a qualifying method: Requests faxed to a public office do not support statutory damages.

Third-party email and agency: The court declines to decide whether a requester can obtain statutory damages when a non-attorney agent emails the request, but holds that Brown failed to prove that the friend who emailed his request was in fact his authorized agent.

Contempt standard: A public office is not in contempt where it has made good-faith efforts to comply with a limited writ ordering it to obtain records from private contractors, even if the contractors decline to produce certain categories of records or state that none exist.

III. Legal and Factual Background

A. The Underlying Public-Records Requests

Brown’s August 2023 requests to the sheriff concerned:

Policy records – policies on inmate intake and booking procedures, including specific policy-related “information” about:

lost, stolen, or misplaced inmate records;

drug testing and toxicity testing for impaired inmates; and

mental health and psychiatric evaluation processes at booking.

Personnel records – records about jail personnel for a specific historical period (January 1, 2017, to July 1, 2018).

Retention policies – records-retention schedules and related policies, including for jail activity logs.

He claims that:

he tried hand delivery but was refused;

he attempted certified mail, which was returned as undeliverable; and

he ultimately submitted the requests by fax.

Separately, a third party, Christine Serna, emailed the requests to the sheriff and averred in an affidavit that she acted with “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’ for Terry Brown.”

B. The Private Jail Administrators

Columbiana County contracts with:

GEO, which operated the jail from 2014 to approximately 2019; and

CSG, which began operating the jail in January 2022.

In the earlier phase of the case, the sheriff had responded that many of the requested records were not in his possession but instead were maintained by CSG (or, for earlier years, GEO), and thus Brown should direct his requests to those companies. Brown instead filed a mandamus action against the sheriff and the “Columbiana County Jail.” The court dismissed the jail as a non-entity but granted a limited writ against the sheriff.

C. The Limited Writ (2024 Decision) and Quasi-Agency

In Brown, 2024-Ohio-4969, the court declined to treat CSG and GEO as defendants because Brown did not sue them and had not made direct public-records requests to them. The court also found that its functional-equivalency line of cases (making certain private entities directly subject to the Public Records Act) did not apply, because the private contractors were not parties.

Instead, the court invoked a quasi-agency doctrine derived from State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson, 49 Ohio St.3d 37 (1990), holding that:

Records held by a private entity can be within the “jurisdiction” of a public office when they are created and maintained to carry out the public office’s duties and where the public office can monitor performance and access the records.

On that basis, the court ordered the sheriff to:

request and obtain relevant records from CSG and GEO; or

certify that such records do not exist.

Importantly, the court did not require that the sheriff maintain control over CSG or GEO for quasi-agency to apply; it was enough that the entities were performing a “delegated public duty.”

IV. Precedents and Authorities Cited

A. Public Records Act and Private Entities

R.C. 149.43 (Ohio Public Records Act): establishes the right of any person to inspect and obtain copies of public records, defines “public record,” and sets forth procedures and remedies, including statutory damages.

State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, 2006-Ohio-4854:

Establishes a strong presumption that private entities are not “public offices” subject to the Act.

Creates an exception where a private entity is the functional equivalent of a public office.

State ex rel. Harm Reduction Ohio v. OneOhio Recovery Found., 2023-Ohio-1547:

Applies the functional-equivalency test to a private foundation, holding it subject to the Public Records Act.

Confirms that when a private entity is a functional equivalent of a public office, a requester may sue it directly in mandamus for access to records.

State ex rel. Mazzaro v. Ferguson, 49 Ohio St.3d 37 (1990):

Articulates the quasi-agency test used in the earlier phase of this case.

Holds that records in the possession of a private entity can be deemed public records if:

the private entity prepared the records to carry out the public office’s responsibilities;

the public office can monitor the private entity’s performance; and

the public office has access to the records for that purpose.

Also emphasizes, in construing R.C. 149.43(C), that a requester may sue either the public office or the person responsible for the records—a point later stressed in Justice Brunner’s opinion.

State ex rel. Armatas v. Plain Twp. Bd. of Trustees, 2021-Ohio-1176:

Confirms and applies the quasi-agency concept, requiring a public office to obtain records held by a private entity performing delegated public functions.

Forms the doctrinal backbone for the limited writ issued in the earlier Brown decision.

B. Statutory Damages and Methods of Transmission

R.C. 149.43(C)(2)–(3) (pre–April 9, 2025 version):

A requester may be entitled to statutory damages if a public office fails to comply with its obligations under the Public Records Act.

To be eligible, the request must be transmitted by:

hand delivery,

certified mail, or

electronic submission (e.g., email, and in some circumstances, web-based portals) as specified in the statute.

Effective April 9, 2025, R.C. 149.43 was amended (2024 Sub.H.B. No. 265) to bar statutory damages for persons committed to the custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, but the court applies the pre-amendment version to Brown’s case.

State ex rel. Grim v. New Holland, 2024-Ohio-4822:

Holds that the requester bears the burden to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, entitlement to statutory damages.

State ex rel. Sultaana v. Mansfield Corr. Inst., 2023-Ohio-1177:

Holds that faxed public-records requests do not qualify for statutory damages.

State ex rel. Brinkman v. Toledo City School Dist. Bd. of Edn., 2024-Ohio-5063:

Holds that a requester is eligible for statutory damages when his attorney submits public-records requests by email on his behalf.

Demonstrates that attorney-transmitted electronic requests are treated as requests by the client for statutory-damages purposes.

C. Scope of Requests: Information vs Records

State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, 2006-Ohio-6365:

Clarifies that the Public Records Act provides a right to records, not general “information.”

“Requests for information…are improper requests under R.C. 149.43.”

State ex rel. Lanham v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 1997-Ohio-104:

Holds that a request framed only as a demand for “information” rather than specific records is not a proper public-records request.

D. Contempt Statute and Agency Law

R.C. 2705.02(A):

Defines contempt to include “[d]isobedience of, or resistance to, a lawful writ.”

Provides the statutory basis for sanctions such as fines or imprisonment for contempt of court orders.

Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (referenced by the majority):

Defines “disobedience” as refusal or negligence in obeying a command.

Guides the court’s analysis of whether the sheriff’s conduct qualifies as “disobedience.”

Turner v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 2020-Ohio-248 (10th Dist. App.) (cited by Justice Brunner):

Notes that an agency relationship can be implied; written documentation is not always required to establish agency authority.

Supports Brunner’s criticism of the majority’s apparent insistence on documentary proof of power of attorney or written authorization.

V. The Court’s Legal Reasoning

A. Statutory Damages: Transmission and Proof

1. Brown’s Methods of Transmission

Under R.C. 149.43(C)(2), to even be eligible for statutory damages, a requester must show that his request was transmitted by:

hand delivery to the public office; or

certified mail; or

electronic submission (e.g., email).

Brown relied on three methods:

Attempted hand delivery to the sheriff (allegedly refused).

Certified mail to the Columbiana County Jail, returned undeliverable.

Fax to the sheriff.

Email submitted by Serna, claiming to act as Brown’s agent.

2. Hand Delivery and Certified Mail: “Successful” Transmission

The majority holds that Brown did not carry his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, successful transmission by hand delivery or certified mail:

Brown’s affidavit asserts that he “attempted” hand delivery but was refused. He does not identify:

who refused the hand delivery; or

how, as an incarcerated person at Belmont Correctional Institution, he could have personally accomplished hand delivery to the sheriff in Columbiana County.

The certified-mail attempt was provably unsuccessful: the mailing was returned as “not deliverable as addressed.”

Because R.C. 149.43(C) contemplates actual delivery of the request by a specified method, not merely an attempt, the court concludes that Brown fails to prove successful transmission under either hand delivery or certified mail.

3. Faxed Requests: Categorical Exclusion

Brown faxed the requests to the sheriff, but under Sultaana, faxed requests do not qualify for statutory damages. The majority applies this rule directly: fax submission cannot serve as the predicate for statutory damages.

4. Email by a Non-Attorney “Agent”

Serna submitted the public-records requests to the sheriff by email, stating in her affidavit that she acted with “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’ for Terry Brown.” Brown argued that this satisfied the electronic-submission requirement.

The majority’s analysis proceeds in two steps:

Unresolved legal question. The court notes it has never squarely addressed whether a requester can obtain statutory damages when his non-attorney agent (rather than the requester himself or his licensed attorney) transmits the email request. By contrast, Brinkman held that an attorney-sent email request qualifies the client for statutory damages.

No clear and convincing evidence of agency. The majority finds it unnecessary to answer that broader question because Brown did not sufficiently prove that Serna was in fact his agent:

Brown provided no documentation of any executed power of attorney.

Serna is not an attorney and does not claim to be licensed to practice law.

Her statement that she acted “with Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’” is characterized as a conclusory assertion, insufficient to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

Accordingly, the court holds:

“Serna’s conclusory statement that she was acting ‘with Power of Attorney and “Agent Status” for Terry Brown’ is not clear and convincing evidence that Brown executed a power of attorney authorizing her as his agent.”

Because Brown fails to prove any qualifying transmission method, the court denies statutory damages altogether.

B. Contempt and Sanctions: Disobedience and Resistance

Brown sought to hold the sheriff in contempt under R.C. 2705.02(A) for:

alleged failures to produce policy records (requests 4, 5, 11, 12);

incomplete or missing personnel records (requests 1, 2, 6, 7); and

failure to provide a records-retention schedule specific to the jail.

The court’s contempt analysis emphasizes two key points:

The sheriff’s obligation is limited by the court’s writ. The writ required the sheriff to:

request records from CSG and GEO; and

provide Brown with the records obtained or certify nonexistence.

It did not empower the sheriff to compel CSG or GEO to maintain or create records, nor to override their determinations about nonexistence or overbreadth.

Contempt requires “disobedience” or “resistance.” Relying on dictionary definitions, the court distinguishes:

Disobedience – refusal or negligent failure to obey a command.

Resistance – active opposition to execution of a command.

The court finds that the sheriff:

complied with the writ by:

promptly requesting records from both CSG and GEO;

forwarding whatever records those companies provided; and

conveying their representations as to overbreadth or nonexistence.

did not obstruct or undermine Brown’s ability to narrow or clarify his requests; indeed, the sheriff:

transmitted CSG’s invitation to Brown to “be more specific” about the policy requests; and

affirmatively invited Brown to “discuss the outstanding records being sought” with the sheriff.

Any alleged gaps in the production stem, in the court’s view, from:

the vagueness or scope of Brown’s requests; or

the limitations asserted by CSG and GEO (e.g., that they had no statistical data, that they had no responsive personnel documents, or that no separate jail-specific retention schedule exists).

Because these are not actions of the sheriff in “disobedience” or “resistance” to the writ, the court finds no basis for contempt.

1. Policy-Records Requests (Nos. 4, 5, 11, 12)

Request No. 5 (“statistics on how often inmate case files or medical records are lost, stolen, or misplaced”):

CSG responded that it was “not in possession of any statistical data you have requested.”

The majority notes that even if individual incidents of lost or misplaced files occurred, this does not prove the existence of a statistical dataset; thus, the sheriff did not defy the writ by forwarding CSG’s statement of nonexistence.

Requests Nos. 4, 11, 12 (policy information on lost records; drug testing; mental-health evaluation):

CSG labeled these requests “overly broad” and invited Brown to specify more precisely the documents he sought.

CSG also stated that it was not required to “create information or documents that do not exist.”

The sheriff relayed this to Brown and further invited Brown to refine his requests.

Brown did not narrow or clarify, but instead moved for contempt.

The majority underscores that:

“True, CSG didn’t provide records that the sheriff asked it to provide. But any fault for that…lies with CSG, not the sheriff.”

Thus, the sheriff neither disobeyed nor resisted the writ as to policy records.

2. Personnel-Records Requests (Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7)

Requests Nos. 1, 6, 7:

GEO responded that it had no responsive records.

The sheriff forwarded GEO’s letter to Brown, thereby complying with the requirement to “obtain records or certify nonexistence” as communicated by the contractor.

Request No. 2:

GEO did provide some personnel records, which the sheriff transmitted to Brown.

Brown alleged that some temporary employee names and positions were omitted, suggesting incomplete production.

The majority notes:

Neither Brown nor the sheriff filed these documents in the Supreme Court record, making it impossible to assess the alleged omissions.

Any alleged omission is at best attributable to GEO, not the sheriff.

Again, the sheriff’s actions fit the court’s understanding of full compliance, not contemptuous resistance.

3. Records-Retention Schedule

Brown argued that he did not receive a “records-retention schedule for the Columbiana County Jail,” distinct from the sheriff’s office schedule.

The sheriff replied:

he has provided the only retention schedule he maintains, a seven-page document covering both sheriff’s office and jail records, including the daily jail activity log; and

no separate jail-only retention schedule exists.

Finding nothing in the record to contradict this, the court concludes that the sheriff complied with the writ. There is no contempt.

VI. Justice Brunner’s Concurrence in Part and Dissent in Part

A. Agreement on Contempt

Justice Brunner agrees that the sheriff complied with the limited writ and that contempt is unwarranted. She sees no basis to revisit the reasoning of the previous decision granting the writ under quasi-agency.

B. Critique of Majority’s Characterization of the Earlier Writ

Brunner resists the majority’s suggestion that Brown could or should have sued CSG and GEO directly:

She notes that private contractors in correctional settings often resist being characterized as public offices or as subject to the Public Records Act, citing recent litigation where private vendors have moved to dismiss on those grounds (e.g., Ware v. Pierce; pending motions by Aramark, Trinity Services Group, and Securus Technologies).

Under Mazzaro and R.C. 149.43(C), a mandamus action may be filed against either:

the public office (here, the sheriff’s office); or

the person responsible for public records (here, arguably CSG and GEO).

She stresses that Brown’s choice to sue only the sheriff’s office was lawful and effective; indeed, he prevailed in obtaining a limited writ.

In her view, it is ""unnecessary and overly critical"" for the majority to revisit and implicitly fault Brown’s litigation choices.

C. Statutory Damages: Agency and Evidence

Justice Brunner strongly disagrees with the majority’s denial of statutory damages. Her key points:

Delivery by email is established.

Brown’s affidavit states that, after other methods failed, the requests were submitted by fax and by email.

Serna’s affidavit confirms that she emailed two public-records requests on Brown’s behalf to the sheriff’s office.

These sworn statements, taken together, are sufficient to prove that the requests were delivered by email, satisfying the transmission requirement of R.C. 149.43(C)(3).

No dispute by the sheriff’s office.

The sheriff did not oppose damages on the ground that email transmission was defective or that Serna lacked authority; rather, the sheriff’s argument focused on a purported good-faith belief about not having to obtain records from private contractors.

In Brunner’s view, the majority raises an issue—non-attorney agency—that was never argued by the respondents, and then decides it against Brown without necessity.

Agency can be implied.

Citing Turner v. Univ. of Cincinnati, Brunner notes that an agency relationship does not always require written documentation.

Serna and Brown are both laypersons; Serna’s reference to “Power of Attorney and ‘Agent Status’” should be read as a lay description of her authority to send the email at Brown’s request.

Requiring formal, documentary proof of a power of attorney in this context is, in her view, an unwarranted evidentiary hurdle not supported by R.C. 149.43.

Good-faith reduction of damages rejected.

Under R.C. 149.43(C)(3)(a), statutory damages may be reduced if, based on existing law, a well-informed public office could reasonably believe its conduct complied with the statute.

The sheriff’s office claims that it in good faith believed it did not need to obtain records from the private jail administrators and could instead direct Brown to request them directly.

Brunner points out that Armatas (2021) had already held that a public office must obtain records from a private contractor in a quasi-agency relationship, and the court awarded damages there. Thus, the sheriff’s position was not “reasonable” under existing law.

On that basis, she would award Brown $1,000 in statutory damages, the maximum allowed, without reduction for good faith.

Brunner concludes that the majority’s denial of damages is premised on an “illusory and unnecessary inquiry” into Serna’s agency status and adds a requirement—documentary proof of power of attorney—that is not rooted in statute or precedent.

VII. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Mandamus

A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government officer or agency to do something the law clearly requires it to do. In the public-records context, mandamus is the primary vehicle for forcing compliance with the Public Records Act when a public office fails to produce requested records.

B. Statutory Damages under the Public Records Act

Statutory damages are a set amount of money made available by statute, not based on actual monetary loss. Under R.C. 149.43(C):

They are designed to encourage compliance with the Public Records Act and compensate requesters for delay or wrongful denial of records.

However, they are only available if:

the request was delivered via a qualifying method (hand delivery, certified mail, electronic submission); and

the public office failed to comply with certain statutory obligations.

As of April 9, 2025, inmates in state custody are no longer eligible for statutory damages, though this change does not retroactively affect Brown’s case.

C. Clear and Convincing Evidence

“Clear and convincing evidence” is a standard of proof higher than “preponderance of the evidence” (more likely than not) but lower than “beyond a reasonable doubt.” It requires evidence that produces a firm belief or conviction in the factfinder’s mind about the facts to be proven.

Here, Brown had to present clear and convincing evidence that he transmitted the request by a qualifying method. The majority found his evidence (particularly regarding hand delivery, certified mail, and Serna’s agency) insufficient at that elevated standard.

D. Quasi-Agency vs. Functional Equivalency

Functional Equivalency:

Asks whether a nominally private entity functions so much like a public office (e.g., in governance, funding, purpose, and level of public control) that it should itself be treated as a “public office” directly subject to the Public Records Act.

If so, requesters can sue the private entity directly.

Quasi-Agency:

Does not make the private entity a public office.

Instead, treats certain records in the contractor’s possession as being within the “jurisdiction” of the public office for purposes of public-records disclosure when:

they were prepared to carry out the public office’s duties,

the public office can monitor performance, and

the public office has access to the records.

The public office remains the mandamus respondent, but must obtain and produce records from the contractor where these elements are met.

E. Contempt of Court

Contempt is a court’s power to punish conduct that disobeys or obstructs its orders. Under R.C. 2705.02(A), contempt includes:

Disobedience – a refusal or negligent failure to do what a court order requires (e.g., ignoring a court-ordered obligation).

Resistance – actively opposing or hindering enforcement of the order (e.g., undermining or obstructing compliance).

In this case, the sheriff promptly requested documents from CSG and GEO, forwarded what he received, and transmitted their explanations of nonexistence or overbreadth. The court found no evidence that he refused to comply or actively obstructed compliance with the writ.

F. Requests for “Information” vs. Requests for “Records”

The Public Records Act guarantees access to records, not to general “information.” A proper request should describe records—documents, files, emails, logs, policies—rather than ask generalized questions.

The court notes (in a footnote) that Brown's wording (“policy information” on various topics) might be viewed as an improper request for information rather than records, but it declines to decide the issue because the sheriff did not raise it.

VIII. Impact and Implications

A. For Incarcerated Requesters and Statutory Damages

This case is a transitional decision, important both for how it applies the pre-2025 statutory regime and for what it implies going forward:

It underscores that imprisoned requesters must strictly satisfy procedural prerequisites to preserve statutory-damages claims, including:

ensuring successful delivery by a qualifying method; and

maintaining documentary or testimonial proof sufficient to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

However, after April 9, 2025, R.C. 149.43 bars statutory damages to persons committed to ODRC custody, making the transmission issues litigated here largely academic for future inmate-requesters (though they can still obtain records and possibly court costs or other relief).

B. For Use of Agents and Third-Party Intermediaries

The decision leaves unresolved but fraught questions about using non-attorney agents to submit requests:

The majority avoids deciding whether statutory damages are available when a non-attorney agent emails a request on a requester’s behalf.

It signals that conclusory statements in an affidavit about “Power of Attorney” or “agent status” will not, by themselves, suffice; more concrete evidence of authorization may be needed to meet the clear-and-convincing standard.

Justice Brunner’s dissent suggests a more flexible, pragmatic approach: testimony that a friend was authorized to send the email may be enough, especially if unchallenged by the public office.

For practitioners and requesters:

If possible, submit requests personally by email or certified mail, or through a licensed attorney.

If relying on a non-attorney intermediary, consider:

executing a short written authorization; and

keeping documentation showing that the intermediary acted at the requester’s direction.

C. For Public Offices Working with Private Contractors

The opinion reinforces and clarifies obligations of public offices that outsource operations:

Public offices must request records from private contractors when a quasi-agency relationship exists.

However, they will generally not be held in contempt for the contractor’s refusal or limitations, so long as they:

make timely requests to the contractor;

forward all responsive records received; and

communicate to the requester any statements from the contractor regarding overbreadth or nonexistence.

This creates a practical division of responsibility:

The public office must act diligently and transparently; and

The private contractor bears responsibility (doctrinally and practically) for any underproduction, although the contractor may not be directly before the court unless separately sued or deemed a functional equivalent of a public office.

D. Contempt as an Enforcement Tool in Public-Records Cases

The court’s rigorous definition of “disobedience” and “resistance” somewhat narrows the use of contempt as an enforcement mechanism against public offices that rely on private contractors:

Even where records remain missing or incomplete, contempt will not lie if the public office has:

taken reasonable steps to comply;

documented those efforts; and

not obstructed or delayed production.

Requesters facing nonresponsive contractors may need to:

directly sue the contractor (if it is or may be a functional equivalent of a public office); or

seek expansion of the writ to bring the contractor into the case where legally possible.

E. Internal Division on Statutory Damages Standards

The sharp disagreement between the majority and Justice Brunner highlights a doctrinal tension:

How strictly should courts enforce technical prerequisites (like documentary proof of agency) for statutory damages?

To what extent should courts infer agency or rely on uncontradicted affidavits from laypersons?

Future cases may need to address squarely:

whether non-attorney agents can trigger statutory damages when they email a request on another’s behalf; and

what type and quantum of evidence is necessary to show an agency relationship for this purpose.

IX. Conclusion

State ex rel. Brown v. Columbiana County Jail, 2025-Ohio-5280, consolidates and extends several important strands of Ohio public-records law:

It confirms that statutory damages are never automatic; requesters must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that their requests were delivered by one of the specified methods in R.C. 149.43(C).

It reiterates that faxed requests do not qualify for statutory damages and emphasizes the need for robust evidentiary support when requests are transmitted via intermediaries.

It clarifies that public offices that rely on private contractors may be obligated to seek records from those contractors under quasi-agency principles, but will not necessarily face contempt if the contractors do not comply, provided the public office has obeyed the court’s writ in good faith.

It underscores the ongoing complexity of public-records enforcement in a landscape increasingly populated by private vendors and jail/prison contractors, where lines of responsibility are often contested.

Justice Brunner’s separate opinion underscores a countervailing policy concern: that rigid, technical applications of statutory prerequisites and evidentiary standards may unduly limit the remedial force of the Public Records Act, especially for incarcerated and pro se requesters. She would have awarded Brown $1,000 in statutory damages, finding that existing quasi-agency caselaw gave the sheriff fair notice of his duties and that Brown’s affidavits sufficed to show valid email transmission.

Overall, Brown refines Ohio’s law on statutory damages and contempt in public-records litigation, particularly in the context of privatized correctional operations and third-party intermediaries. For public offices, it highlights the importance of prompt, documented efforts to obtain records from contractors and clear communication with requesters. For requesters and practitioners, it reinforces the need for careful attention to method of delivery, documentation of transmission and agency, and strategic consideration of whether and when to bring private entities directly into public-records litigation.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 10:58:05.288443

Call for Applications

Irish Yearbook of International Law: The editors of the Irish Yearbook of International Law welcome expressions of interest from persons interested in taking on the role of Editor(s) in Chief.

Since its foundation, the Yearbook has always had at least two Joint Editors-in-Chief, supported by an editorial board and advisory committee. The current Editors-in-Chief are James Gallen (DCU), Richard Collins (QUB) and Bríd Ní Ghráinne (Maynooth).

The primary responsibilities of the Editors-in-Chief are to liaise with the publisher (Hart Bloomsbury), generate and manage article submissions, oversee the commissioning and editing of correspondents’ reports, and to oversee generation and editing of book reviews. The Editors-in-Chief should have expertise in any area of Public or Private International Law and should have some connection with Ireland, for example, employment/ previous employment in Ireland and/or has received an educational qualification from an institution in Ireland. The IYIL is published once per year, and the new Editors-in-Chief should be in place to take the lead on the 2024 Yearbook (to be published in 2026). The outgoing Editors-in-Chief will provide transitional support.

Expressions of interest in the form of a cover letter and CV should be sent to the outgoing editors by 15 January 2026 (james.gallen@dcu.ie; rcollins@qub.ac.uk; brid.nighrainne@mu.ie). We welcome combined expressions of interest from persons proposing to act as Joint Editors-in-Chief, or expressions of interest from individuals. In the latter case, we may propose the role be shared between two or more persons who express an interest.

Calls for Papers

Human Rights and the Crises of Global Order: The Nordic Journal of Human Rights invites submissions of papers presenting innovative scholarship analysing the multiple challenges facing the international human rights project amid shifting global power relations in contemporary world politics and seeking to address issues such as:

How are international human rights institutions – and the actors within them – adapting to geopolitical and normative transformations?

How can we distinguish between the use and abuse of human rights claims in an increasingly plural global landscape?

How do human rights defenders and policymakers need to rethink strategies, concepts, and methodologies to confront the erosion of democracy, ongoing armed conflicts, or the evolving conditions for accountability and justice?

The journal takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights as legal, political, and social practice. We publish high-quality scholarship analysing the past, present and future of human rights from a variety of theoretical and methodological viewpoints. For more information, see here.

Climate Apartheid – Law, Economy, Culture: The “Climate Apartheid: Law, Economy, Culture” project at the Institute of Advanced Study, Durham University, invites papers for its conference on the same topic on 24-25 March 2026. The term ‘climate apartheid’ was first coined in 2007 by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to raise alarm about uneven patterns of climate change adaptation. In 2019, the concept gained more international attention when the Special Rapporteur Philip Alston warned the UN Human Rights Council that ‘climate apartheid’ was a ‘scenario’ in which the ‘wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict, while the rest of the world is left to suffer.’ Since then, ‘climate apartheid’ has been invoked or implied in a range of contexts from academic analyses to climate and racial justice activism and concerning border enforcement and immigration policy, infrastructural development, the law, the development of emergent technologies, climate colonialism, responsibilities for loss and damage, climate adaptation, and climate-resilient urbanism. Despite the proliferation of the concept’s use, however, it remains unclear how it is and ought to be precisely comprehended and utilized, for whom the concept is available, how it can be distinguishable from other concepts including ‘climate justice’, and what opportunities or barriers it creates. In this conference we aim to take an interdisciplinary approach understand how climate apartheid is, has been, and could be used. Abstracts of up to 500 words are due 16 January; more details and a submission form are available here.

His reluctance to declare himself a Democrat publicly is tied up with what he finds objectionable about the current administration.
Republicans used to be willing to discuss issues with the other side “to come up with solution(s),” he said.
Most participants in the vigil were middle aged at least, but it was heartening to see some younger ones, said Koller, who is 65.
It was a pretty good turnout for a Sunday evening, according to Carol Taylor, president of Invisible Blair County and vigil organizer.","About 50 people took part in Indivisible Blair County’s “Lights for Liberty Vigil” near the Blair County Courthouse on Sunday evening to call attention to “the inhumane treatment of refugees, immigrants and their families,” as stated in a flier for the event.

Participants carried battery-operated candles, wore small placards reading “No Kings; No ICE; No Fear” attached to lanyards around their necks and they processed quietly along the sidewalk from the courthouse to the

Diamond, then back again via the sidewalk across the street.

There were a few friendly beeps, but no counter-protesters and no negative interactions with the general public, as police in patrol cars passed by periodically.

“I’m just fed up with the (Trump) administration,” said Billie Conrad of Altoona, as she walked back toward the courthouse on one of several circuits. “There’s a right way and a wrong way (to handle immigration), and they’re doing it the wrong way.”

Raised as a non-denominational Christian, Caleb McCoy of Altoona is angry that supporters of the administration’s policies present themselves as Christian nationalists.

“It turns my stomach,” said McCoy, who no longer considers himself a Christian. It’s a “betrayal” of “what we as a nation purport to stand for,” he said.

Warrantless arrests based on the color of arrestees’ skin or their accents, “blatant intentional infliction of harm,” violation of due process, “disregard of basic human rights,” and lack of accountability are among the issues that upset him, McCoy said.

A former longtime Republican who’s now a Democrat asked that only his first name be used – then asked for even that to be withheld.

He was involved in Republican politics for years and retains many Republican friends and associates and is “not looking to burn any bridges,” he said.

His reluctance to declare himself a Democrat publicly is tied up with what he finds objectionable about the current administration.

Republicans used to be willing to discuss issues with the other side “to come up with solution(s),” he said.

“Now, it’s a war,” he said. “(And) I disagree with the Republican side.”

He cited unpleasant interactions with passing motorists experienced by individuals who’ve protested in front of the office of U.S. Rep. John Joyce as evidence that things could get unpleasant for him.

He knows other Republicans who share his feelings about the administration – and also his reluctance to express misgivings publicly.

Those friends say they’ll make their statements in private at the ballot box, he said.

“People are afraid to speak up because of the backlash,” he said.

His presence in Hollidaysburg on Sunday was an effort “to help in a small way,” he said.

“Another guy standing there with a light,” he said.

It’s critical for groups like Indivisible to gain adherents, including people like him, locally, statewide and nationally, he said.

That will send a message to the politicians, he said.

As for the politicians, those who have fallen “in line need to get a backbone and stand up for what is right,” he said.

He has hope for the 2026 midterms, he said.

“We need to try and start making corrections to this problem,” he said.

Ed Koller of Carson Valley feels like the Trump administration has “broken (his) spirit.”

“I don’t know how this reprehensible human being got elected,” Koller said. “I don’t understand how the whole half of the country accepted this.”

As a Navy Seabee from 1978-82, he also doesn’t understand “how a military man can serve him,” Koller said.

Most participants in the vigil were middle aged at least, but it was heartening to see some younger ones, said Koller, who is 65.

Detentions of immigrants followed by their disappearance into other countries – sometimes countries other than where they originated, are among the administration’s actions that upset Bill Kelley of Tyrone.

This country’s economy needs immigrants, said Dave Galbraith.

They’re needed especially in states like California, where he once lived, he said.

Businesses that depend on immigrants are hurting for workers, he said.

Immigrants are avoiding places they need to go, for fear of arrest, he said.

Those include health care providers and places where they can get food, he said.

It was a pretty good turnout for a Sunday evening, according to Carol Taylor, president of Invisible Blair County and vigil organizer.

People generally believe in Constitutional due process – and that violations are “anathema” in the U.S., Taylor said.

“We are concerned with the harsh immigration policy of this administration,” said Imad Hamad, AHRC Executive Director.
“There is no evidence that a harsh and inhumane immigration policy makes the country safer or richer,” added Hamad.
""Reverse migration is not the policy of a democracy that embraces human rights and democratic values,"" concluded Hamad.","The American Human Rights Council (AHRC-USA) joins the nation in mourning the tragic loss of West Virginia National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, who was killed on Wednesday, November 26, 2025, in an ambush attack outside a Metro station in Washington, D.C. We also extend our heartfelt wishes for a full and speedy recovery to Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, who was critically injured in the same attack.

The attack is under investigation as a possible terrorist attack. Authorities have identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who previously worked as a member of an Afghan CIA partner force in Afghanistan until 2021.

AHRC unequivocally condemns this vile act of violence, regardless of the motive of the shooter. At the same time, we caution against collective blame and generalizations that unfairly target Afghan asylees, migrants, or any community based on race, faith, or national origin.

The Trump administration has pursued restrictive, harsh, and inhumane immigration policies, and the recent shooting in Washington, D.C., is being used to intensify and escalate this agenda and as ammunition in the war on immigration, both legal and illegal.

The Wall Street Journal of November 28 published an article entitled ‘After D.C. National Guard Shooting, Trump Steps Up Immigration Crackdown: White House pushes for ‘reverse migration’ and aims to expand restrictions on nations it deems high risk,’ an article that should raise alarm in the human rights community. The harsh and inhumane immigration policy started before the shooting. No criminal violent act makes a barely legal and inhumane policy acceptable.

We recognize the importance of effective security vetting, as emphasized by President Trump, but stress that broad crackdowns or sweeping labels against entire communities are extreme measures that foster fear, anxiety, and mistrust. They are also ineffective and counterproductive. The US already has high-level vetting process in place.

AHRC stands in solidarity with the families of the victims, expresses its deepest condolences for the loss of Sarah Beckstrom, and prays for the recovery of Andrew Wolfe.

Despite the horrors and harm involved, all three stories show how important discussing lawlessness is to making accountability possible — now or in the future.

The responses from senior officials in the Trump administration — from President Donald Trump on down — to the Wednesday shooting of two National Guard troops sent from West Virginia to Washington, D.C. over the summer was immediately to assess collective guilt and assign collective punishment once an Afghan national was named as the suspect.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed Trump’s racist, anti-immigrant speech in response to the shooting, quickly blaming the Biden administration. An hour later, action. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — under Noem’s jurisdiction — announced that “all” immigration requests involving Afghan nationals had been “stopped indefinitely.” This — as Trump’s speech made clear — was an angle to further restricting immigration from people the Trump administration wants to keep out of America.

This is the stuff of Stephen Miller’s dreams, and he spent Thanksgiving making that clear to anyone who would read to his hate — including lashing out at The Wall Street Journal editorial board for opposing the administration’s racist collective-guilt response.

The head of USCIS followed up on Thanksgiving, announcing that this would go further than the Wednesday statement — both to encompass people already in the U.S. and countries beyond Afghanistan.

After Sarah Beckstrom, one of the West Virginia National Guard troops who was shot, died from her injuries on Thanksgiving, the hate pouring out of the administration only became more aggressive, more lawless.

To end that day, Trump issued a triptych of late-night, racist, anti-immigrant diatribes — horrifyingly discussing unconstitutionally and illegally “denaturaliz[ing]” people who “undermine domestic tranquility“ and “deport[ing]” foreign nationals who are “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

On Friday morning, DHS made clear that all of this was, yes, very fascist, indeed.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, apparently feeling left out, piped in on Friday evening to announce that he, too, was on board with the collective punishment plan.

As the collective-punishment campaign was building, however, the Trump administration was forced to address a second front in its lawlessness.

Share

Around lunchtime on Friday, The Washington Post reported on the administration’s boat-strike murders. The report from Alex Horton and Ellen Nakashima about the first boat strike, on September 2, is alarming. Once analysts became “more confident“ that 11 people aboard the boat they were tracking were drug smugglers, the Post reported, this is what happened:

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. “The order was to kill everybody,” one of them said.

A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck.

The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said. The two men were blown apart in the water.

While purportedly attacking their reporting as “fake news,” Hegseth on Friday evening did not deny the key claim in the report about the second strike, stating, “As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.“

That is not the end of it, not at all. The response to the Post’s report from Jack Goldsmith — the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel official during the George W. Bush administration who withdrew the administration’s earlier “torture memos” — was perhaps the most notable immediate response.

“[T]here can be no conceivable legal justification for what the Washington Post reported earlier today,” he wrote at Executive Functions. “In short, if the Post’s facts are correct, it appears that Special Operations Forces committed murder when the ‘two men were blown apart in the water,’ as the Post put it.”

Ryan Goodman from Just Security reported on Saturday that the Former JAGs Working Group — a group of former military lawyers — echoed Goldsmith, concluding a white paper response, “[S]ince orders to kill survivors of an attack at sea are ‘patently illegal,’ anyone who issues or follows such orders can and should be prosecuted for war crimes, murder, or both.“

By Saturday night, bipartisan leaders of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed Services Committee had issued strong statements.

The Senate leaders, Sens. Roger Wicker and Jack Reed, referencing “recent news reports — and the Department of Defense’s initial response — regarding alleged follow-on strikes on suspected narcotics vessels in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,“ stated that their committee had “directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.”

The House leaders, Reps. Mike Rogers and Adam Smith, similarly stated that their committee is “committed to providing rigorous oversight of the Department of Defense’s military operations in the Caribbean,” adding that they “take seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.”

Finally, and as I reported Friday, Chief Judge James Boasberg’s contempt inquiry over the March 15 flights — with, as of this past week, its increased focus on Noem, in addition to the then-key Justice Department leadership — is also proceeding into its next phase next week:

This weekend, then, illustrates three points at which the administration’s lawlessness can become a part of the public discussion — when officials announce lawless actions, reporting that follows lawlessness, and when orders from federal courts are issued seeking to hold officials accountable for lawlessness.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LPVj!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63172e3b-a943-4916-bb3d-eac4f352a923_1208x890.png",N,,2025-11-30 01:56:23.132173

The raid resulted in the arrests of nine migrants and four protesters.","Several protesters have been arrested in downtown Manhattan after a nearly two-hour confrontation with federal authorities in which they barricaded the entrance of a parking garage, and prevented agents from exiting in vehicles, seemingly foiling an immigration raid.

As President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown continues, dozens of demonstrators Saturday yelled “ICE out of New York!” at police officers standing in front of a parking garage on the edge of Chinatown, according to footage of the standoff posted on social media.

Agents from Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security tried to exit the garage in vehicles when protesters gathered, blocking them with their bodies and piles of garbage bags, according to the New York Times.

A few federal agents — perched on a higher floor of the garage — watched on.

Just before noon Saturday, authorities responded to a 911 call of a “disorderly group” near Centre Street and Howard Street who were blocking the street and, in some cases, throwing debris, the New York Police Department told The Independent.

“They were instructed multiple times to disperse, and they did not comply. As a result, multiple individuals were taken into custody,” police said.

The NYPD didn’t provide the exact number of protesters arrested. The Independent has asked DHS for more information about whether a nearby raid had been planned.

But the police presence didn’t calm the situation. Clashes continued after federal agents finally exited the garage around 1.15 p.m., with protesters trying to block their vehicles with recycling bins and bags of trash, online footage shows.

The Times estimated that about 200 people surrounded the garage, which is part of a government building.

In late October, an immigration raid targeted vendors just a few blocks away on Chinatown’s famed Canal Street. The raid resulted in the arrests of nine migrants and four protesters.

Earlier this month, Trump met with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Following their surprisingly warm meeting, Trump insisted that there wasn’t a need for federal presence in the Big Apple, after he repeatedly threatened to send troops there.

“Right now, other places need it more,” the president told reporters. “We had a very good meeting yesterday. We talked about that.”

President Trump on Saturday pointed to a federal law that grants the president broad authority to restrict immigration just days after unveiling a sweeping new immigration agenda.

In a Truth Social post, Trump highlighted Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the president to ""suspend the entry"" of non-U.S. citizens whenever it is deemed ""detrimental"" to the national interest.

""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate,"" Trump wrote, quoting the law.

“The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.” What is Temporary Protected Status?","Donald Trump plans to remove temporary immigration protections from thousands of Haitians. Trump’s plan became clear on Wednesday when the US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency (USCIS) released a notice to announce that Haitian immigrants will lose Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, on Feb. 3. About 352,959 Haitians will lose protections as a result of this decision, Al Jazeera reported.

Why is Donald Trump taking away immigration protection from Haitians?

As the latest controversial move from the Trump administration became official on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security explained the decision to remove protections from Haitians. The department stated that violent gang activity is causing national security issues to the US. At the same time, the department gave a contradicting statement, saying Haiti is now safe enough for the protected immigrants to return.

“Ending Temporary Protected Status for Haiti reflects a necessary and strategic vote of confidence in the new chapter Haiti is turning,” the department stated, per Al Jazeera. “The United States cannot call for bold change on the ground while signaling doubt from afar.”

What is Temporary Protected Status?

TPS is given to immigrants who are already living in the U.S., but they cannot return to their native country due to unsafe conditions. The program allows immigrants to work and study legally in the U.S. Citizens from about 17 countries were granted TPS earlier in the year. Some of the immigrants protected with TPS are from countries such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.

Haitians have been protected with TPS since 2010 when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake destroyed their country. More than 1.3 million Haitians were displaced due to the devastating earthquake, Al Jazeera reported. In recent years, many Haitians also fled their country due to dire economic conditions and political disruption.

While Trump continues to strip protection from Haitians, human rights advocates are still fighting for justice.

“Revoking Haitians’ legal immigration status that has kept them safe with their families in the US is cruel and dangerous,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement, per Al Jazeera. “Haitian immigrants have contributed immensely to our communities, neighborhoods and local economies, and without them, New York and this nation would not be the same.”","https://cms.blavity.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,slow-connection-quality=30,onerror=redirect/https://cms.blavity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2173420055.jpg",N,,2025-11-29 23:57:20.348593

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins did damage control by saying that the administration’s goal remains that farms should have “a 100% American workforce” and that “ultimately, the answer on this is automation.”

So why is the Trump administration doing the exact opposite, encouraging farmers to import more foreign workers and to slow harvest mechanization? That’s what a recent Department of Labor regulation would do.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump threatened a slew of aggressive actions to curtail legal migration to the U.S. in response to one National Guard member dying after being ambushed near the White House, though the scope of those moves and what legal or congressional mechanisms he may pursue remain unclear.

Trump, who has amplified his anti-immigration rhetoric in the wake of the shooting attack by an Afghan national, said late Thursday he would permanently pause migration from “all Third World Countries,” “terminate” what he called “illegal admissions” under former President Joe Biden and end federal benefits for non-citizens. The president also said he would deport foreign nationals deemed a security risk and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

The comments signal a renewed effort to sharply curtail even legal migration to the U.S. and scale up deportations of those already in the country. Trump’s administration, however, remained largely silent Friday on how any of those changes would be made, which countries would be targeted or how sweeping the actions could be — for instance, whether the president aims to deport significant numbers of people with legal status or even citizenship by denaturalizing them, as he put it.

On Friday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said in a social media post that the U.S. is halting all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The agency earlier announced it would review green cards of people from “countries of concern,” potentially widening efforts to remove legal permanent residents. Those countries are the 19 listed in a travel ban from earlier this year but whether the “third world” nations Trump cited match that list is not clear.

The travel ban imposed in June restricted travel by foreign nationals from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, from entering the U.S., citing the need to counter the threat of terrorist attacks and safeguard the public. Those countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Another seven countries faced partial restrictions.

Federal authorities have identified the suspected shooter as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who previously worked with U.S. forces and the CIA before arriving in the U.S. in 2021, intensifying scrutiny on the more than 190,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Most of those comprise people who assisted U.S. forces during the war and their families.

Since the shooting, the president has claimed Afghan evacuees received no vetting, waving a photo of one departure flight while speaking to the media Thursday. He’s also said Lakanwal simply “went cuckoo” even as the investigation into the gunman’s motives continues.

While the Trump administration has cast blame on the Biden team, Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit group, and would have undergone vetting, including for his work alongside U.S. forces fighting the Taliban. Advocacy groups have called on Lakanwal to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and without his case negatively affecting other Afghans in the U.S.

Even before this week’s shooting, the administration aggressively moved to slash legal migration or travel to the U.S., offering some insight into their priorities. Trump has dramatically lowered the refugee cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by high-skilled workers and revoked thousands of visas.

The administration is also planning to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden.

“If you’re not someone who loves this country, if you’re not any benefit to this country, then we’re going to send you out of this country,” top Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News Wednesday.

The June travel ban reinstated one of the most controversial measures from Trump’s first term, which went through numerous iterations and a protracted court fight before ultimately being upheld by the Supreme Court as “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.”

Trump said the latest ban protects the nation from terrorist attacks and public safety threats. The administration has said the 12 countries on the new list facing full bans were chosen because they pose a “very high” terrorism or national security risk to the U.S. and had deficient screening and vetting processes. The seven countries where travelers face a partial ban were chosen because they posed a “high” risk.

Officials over the holiday weekend sought to quickly signal they were acting on Trump’s threats, adding to confusion over what new steps the administration was taking.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said his department would issue regulations clarifying that refunds for certain income tax benefits were “no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens,” a plan the agency already announced the previous week, before the shooting.

Trump on Thursday night also called for “reverse migration,” but without detailing what that would entail.

Any new immigration moves by the president are likely to draw legal challenges.

The administration is already facing claims it is removing migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections. Multiple lawsuits in federal court allege wrongful deportation, including a transgender woman sent to Mexico despite an immigration judge’s order blocking the move because of her risk of being tortured or killed, and the ongoing case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant from El Salvador who sued to challenge his mistaken deportation to his home country.

The Justice Department has admitted authorities made mistakes in several deportation cases, which could hinder future removal attempts. A federal judge is pressing ahead with an inquiry into whether Trump administration officials willfully defied his orders to turn planes around that were en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful. An analysis from Noah Feldman of Just Security data on immigration cases found “44 involve executive actions that have been blocked by the courts; 92 have been temporarily blocked, and 29 have been blocked pending appeal.”

In a post on X, New York State Attorney General Letitia James wrote, in part, ""Today there was a planned federal operation in lower Manhattan.""

At one point, more than 100 protesters united to create a human barrier outside the parking garage.

""We're here to stand up for our communities, and we're here to stand up for our neighbors,"" protester Amanda Holden said. ""We do not agree with ripping families apart, with ICE ripping families apart. We'll do anything we can to stop it, and that includes putting our bodies on the line.""

Protesters clashed with NYPD officers and what appeared to be Department of Homeland Security officers. Groups of people could be seen throwing debris at police and standing in front of their vehicles.

""There were protesters that had been pepper-sprayed, sprayed with something else that looked kind of like it was orange, and then there were protesters that had bloody faces,"" Holden said.

Video shows white vans did eventually leave the garage.

""Hopefully we were able to stop them from doing stuff down here,"" Zorek said.

It is unclear if any raids were conducted. CBS News New York reached out to DHS twice on Saturday but did not immediately hear back.

The exact number of protesters arrested is unknown at this time. Video shows police officers detaining multiple people and placing them in NYPD vans.

The C.I.A. has not commented on the vetting process that brought the man, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, to the United States, and the former U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity given classified nature of C.I.A. partner units. But the agency’s director, John Ratcliffe, has faulted the Biden administration’s vetting of Mr. Lakanwal and said he “should have never been allowed to come here.” Mr. Lakanwal is accused of killing one of the National Guard members and critically wounding the other in the attack on Wednesday, just blocks from the White House.

Mr. Lakanwal was granted asylum in April, during the Trump administration, but it is not clear when the C.I.A. might have offered its endorsement of him.

The C.I.A. routinely wrote classified letters to add to immigration files to help members of their partner forces in Afghanistan win approval for asylum or parole claims, one of the officials said. American officials believed that the Afghans who had worked with the agency would be in particular danger if they remained behind under a Taliban-run government. The C.I.A.-backed units were responsible for the deaths and detention of Taliban leaders and fighters.

One former American official said the agency was diligent in advocating the immigration cases of all the people it worked with, and had a dedicated team to help them settle in the United States.

The agency also kept extensive biometric data, including retinal scans, on Afghans who served in their units, information that helped identify their partners among the thousands of Afghans who fled the country, according to former officials.

To join the partner forces, at first called Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams and later Zero Units, Afghans needed to get current force members to vouch for them, putting the reputation of their tribe or family on the line. As Afghans moved up in rank, they continued to be vetted regularly.

During the Afghanistan war, the C.I.A. also conducted polygraphs on members of its partner units to identify potential Taliban allies or those with anti-American sentiments, former officials said.

That intense vetting process in Afghanistan — and the work the units did evacuating people to the Kabul International Airport after the regular army collapsed in the face of the Taliban takeover — gave the agency confidence that people who had fought in their units posed no danger to Americans.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/29/multimedia/29dc-intel-ratcliffe-bvzf/29dc-intel-ratcliffe-bvzf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 19:56:30.835611

ICE agents needed to call in the NYPD, who arrested protesters after giving multiple warnings to stop blocking the sidewalk and the garage entrance.

Once the caravan of ICE agents moved out of the garage, NYPD officers were recorded pepper-spraying demonstrators as they tried to chase the departing motorcade, throwing debris and garbage from a nearby dumpster at their vehicles. The departing ICE agents drove to New Jersey to regroup, a law enforcement source told The News.

Several protesters were taken into custody after they ignored multiple warnings to back away from the building, the NYPD said. Some were charged with disorderly conduct for jumping the barricades and throwing garbage, and dragging planters and city garbage cans into the street. The exact numbers and charges were not immediately disclosed Saturday afternoon. At least 10 people were seen handcuffed and escorted away by cops as the protest raged on.

“I saw the NYPD pepper-spray, mace people,” protester Jay Walker, 58, told the Daily News. “(The protesters) were trying to impede the ICE trucks from going on.”

Another protester, Mia Kurzer, said she was knocked down to the ground during the ensuing chaos.

“I was trying to block ICE vehicles from arresting my neighbors,” Kurzer, 22, said.

The scheduled ICE operation was believed to be similar to one that occurred on Canal St. a month ago when agents, in a surprise raid, swooped in to target illegal street vendors. The protesters on Saturday managed to locate ICE’s rallying point — the garage — and quickly alerted fellow protesters to join them, sources said.

Monica Klein, a spokesperson for Mayor-elect Mamdani, condemned the planned ICE action.

“The Mayor-elect has made it clear — including to the President — that these raids are cruel and inhumane, and fail to advance genuine public safety. New York City’s more than 3 million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality and success, and the mayor-elect remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of every single New Yorker, upholding our sanctuary laws, and deescalation rather than use of unnecessary force.”

Because of New York’s sanctuary city law, the NYPD is barred from helping the feds with civil immigration enforcement, but cops can be called in if a crime or violation is being committed, such as protesters blocking sidewalks or stopping traffic.

Ricky Patel, Homeland Security special agent in charge of the New York field office, called Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch and apologized over the way the situation unfolded, a source with knowledge of the conversation said.

“She told him that what happened today is unacceptable,” the source said. “ICE has tried this twice with these shows of force that are intended to cause chaos and disorder on our streets, but all they are doing is putting the public, federal agents and her cops in harm’s way. She warned them that this needs to stop because, if it happens again, someone will get hurt and it will be entirely on them.”

The confrontation started just before noon as a large crowd dropped traffic cones and stood in front of the entrance to the Centre St. garage near Howard St., about a block from Canal St. Videos on news sites and social media show masked agents going back inside the garage as the protesters showed up. Some of them watched the gathering crowd from a second-floor landing.

Within an hour, dozens of protesters had converged on the garage. ICE agents called in the NYPD to set up barricades and push the protesters blocking the sidewalk and garage exit back so they could leave.

“Is this what you want, tearing America apart?” one protester demanded to know from an ICE agent.

Other protesters linked arms in front of the garage, chanting, “ICE out of New York!” as others pounded on the plastic barricades.

NYPD officials said they received a call for a disorderly group on Centre St., blocking egress from a building.

Cops made multiple arrests as they tried to move the protesters away from the garage entrance, the NYPD confirmed. According to a police source, the cops who pepper-sprayed protesters were from the Strategic Response Group. However, some of the SRG officers themselves were also seen staggering along and rubbing their eyes in pain after being pepper-sprayed.

Some protesters learned a procession of ICE agents were leaving the garage from another entrance and ran over there, dragging large planters and garbage cans into the middle of the street.

“One of the tactics that people use is that they take the garbage cans and push them into the street to try to impede the traffic,” Walker said. “When that happens, the garbage falls out.”

A request for comment from the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned. Confrontations like this between ICE agents and protesters in other cities have resulted in stepped-up federal law enforcement activity amid the Trump administration’s sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

City Hall declined comment.

Last month’s raid on Canal Street also provoked a grass roots response. As dozens of ICE agents detained a total of nine allegedly undocumented vendors at the Oct. 21 enforcement action, a crowd of people gathered to protest, then followed the agents down to 26 Federal Plaza — ICE’s Manhattan processing and detention center — where a larger protest took place.",https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2248478940.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-29 20:56:45.719902

Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside.
Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.
But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast.
Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.","Earlier this year, the Trump administration reversed the convention that nobody would be snatched by immigration and customs enforcement, or ICE, by a school, church or hospital. Since then, teachers have reported classrooms a third empty, as parents are too scared to send their kids in – volunteers walk them there and back.

In the Rogers Park area of Chicago, a group of citizens are organising to resist such immigration raids. Sometimes, it’s simple non-violent tactics, such as slowing officers down by walking in front of them. Last month, 50 people rushed to a church, where the congregation was trapped, having got word that there were ICE agents waiting outside. Maybe their most evocative tactic is whistles – coded blasts for when a convoy is suspected to be ICE agents, a different code when it’s confirmed. They have numerous accounts of undocumented migrants warned off driving right into a raid, which is galvanising, but they also see and hear dismaying things all the time: vehicles standing empty, one door open, not robbed, merely relieved of their drivers; landscape gardeners arrested off ladders. Earlier this month, the Protect Rogers Park group got 1,500 calls in a day.

This isn’t unusual; people don’t like it when their neighbours are disappeared. Similar stories could be told about Kenmore Street, Glasgow, or Peckham, in London, where neighbours surrounded Home Office vans until they were forced to release their cargo and head home.

But I only know about Rogers Park from Criminal, a true-crime podcast. It’s been running for more than a decade, and covers crimes that range from the macabre to the peculiar – always introduced with the same disconcerting intonation, the host announcing “I’m Phoebe Judge” with the kind of pride and pizzazz you might use for “I’m Mr Invisible”. But who, in this episode, is the criminal?

It’s plain from the start that she is not talking about the whistleblowers, and yet it still takes a while for your brain to catch up: she has got to mean the federal government. This is a huge thing to imply, only secondarily because Trump is notoriously litigious, particularly against media organisations. First and foremost, it’s a terrifying thing to articulate: if your government is breaking the law, what do laws mean? Can any be relied upon once some are breached? How do you tell the difference between living in such a society and hiding in it? In this, and a number of other episodes, Criminal is forensic, sober, but also quite unusual: a norm has settled over the reporting of ICE, where all the facts are laid out – raw numbers, painful details, the state of detention centres – except the central one, that people are being kidnapped.

Hannah Arendt discussed the term Gleichschaltung, roughly translatable as “coordination” or “synchronisation”. It came from the Nazi justice minister Franz Gürtner to mean, broadly, that all political, social, cultural and civic institutions had to fall in line with the totalitarian state. Such a thing can only be achieved with the complicity of everyone: the minute-by-minute decisions of people who will do anything, personally or professionally, to stay with the majority. It might mean turning a blind eye to unacceptable state actions, or it might mean insisting, with the logic of your arguments, that things are still the same when they plainly are not.

This is the trap many Democrats are currently in – they produce pie charts to show that the majority of immigrants snatched off the streets are not criminals, but they do not say that to detain 65,000 people is an authoritarian act. And this is partly a boiling-frog effect: ICE has been in existence since 2003, introduced by George W Bush after 9/11; Barack Obama was no stranger to deportations; that uptick of detainees may break records, and the sheer activity of ICE across the US is running communities ragged, but there were nearly 40,000 migrants in detention when Donald Trump took office in January. Nobody gets a memo when democracy tips into something else.

But it’s not all avoidance: most people prefer to synchronise, to stick with the majority. The anthropologist Michael Maccoby, writing in The Leaders We Need almost 20 years ago, drew on the research of Erich Fromm from 1930s Germany, and summarised quite bluntly that, as Fromm predicted, only about 15% of people resisted nazism. It wasn’t because they were fervent supporters, or even, at the outset, because they were scared, but because that’s where the herd was.

The US is currently trying to export its anti-migrant agenda. The New York Times reported on a bizarre set of documents in which Marco Rubio tells diplomats in Europe to “regularly engage host governments … to raise US concerns about violent crimes associated with people of a migration background”. Bizarre as that is, it’s not why the story of Rogers Park, and the storytelling of Protect Rogers Park, is universally relevant.

Don’t wait until your government is so racist that it’s lifting people off ladders while they are trying to work, or seizing kids as they are trying to get to school, before you protest. Every time you hear aggressive xenophobia and racist insinuation from those in power and check in with how it polled before you say it’s disgusting, you are building the herd that will suffocate opposition when it matters.

In an event this autumn, Olly Knowles from Led By Donkeys said “The time to fight fascism isn’t five to midnight”, going on to say that he didn’t think we were at five to midnight in the UK. Someone in the audience said “What time is it?”, and it was funny because, really, who can say? It’s quite impressionistic, this metaphor, it’s not what you would call digital. But it’s the question to ask with each fresh wave of anti-migrant policy, and rhetoric, and kite-flying, and debate: what time does that make it? Because five to midnight is too late.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7ac510825001e5bfe7c54ab6f590c6c31139f5d/511_0_4503_3602/master/4503.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=c4833d2f320374dc340a77a95a28dc91",N,,2025-11-29 15:56:52.124072
,Human Rights,2025-11-29 20:31:57+00:00,Los Angeles Times,School enrollment drops amid ICE raids. 'We just don't know what happened to them.',"Howard Blume, Kate Payne, www.latimes.com, howard-blume",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-29/school-enrollment-plummets-lausd-amid-trump-immigration-raids,"The drop also reflects the lack of non-U.S.-born students, or “newcomers,” entering the nation’s public school systems.
How Los Angeles Unified is affected In the L.A. Unified School District, enrollment overall is down just over 4% compared with last year.
Newcomers are defined as non-U.S.-born students enrolled for three or fewer years in any U.S. school.
Widespread effect on newcomer students In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the last couple of years.
Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students.","Last school year, this Roybal Learning Center junior was doing well and making excellent grades. This year, as a senior, she’s almost dropped out several times and has talked of leaving the U.S. and reuniting with her mother, who was deported over the summer to Guatemala.

So far, the girl has remained in school, says teacher Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona. But many students in similar situations have not.

Across the nation, immigration raids and border restrictions have led to a drop in K-12 enrollment that appears to number in at least the tens of thousands, affecting Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami and elsewhere, based on figures provided by school district officials. The drop also reflects the lack of non-U.S.-born students, or “newcomers,” entering the nation’s public school systems.

For students who had already been attending U.S. schools, the decline is an indicator of disrupted learning — and, in some school districts, financial shortfalls.

“These declines reflect a climate of fear and instability created by ongoing immigration crackdowns, which disrupt family stability, housing and mobility,” said L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho. “When families are afraid to be seen, or when they cannot afford to remain in their communities, they are less likely to enroll, reenroll, or stay in public schools.”

At Roybal, just west of downtown L.A., there are at least 200 fewer students than anticipated, said Cardona, who teaches ethnic studies and serves as coordinator for a film and television magnet program. Before this year, she said, programs at the school had a waiting list.

“We’re not too sure if some students are sheltering in place, if they’re working, or if they got deported or self-deported,” Cardona said. “We’ve done our best to help them with resources but with a lot of the kiddos, we just don’t know what happened to them.”

Neither the U.S. Department of Education nor the Department of Homeland Security — which are charged with enforcing Trump administration education and immigration policy — responded immediately to a request for comment.

How Los Angeles Unified is affected

In the L.A. Unified School District, enrollment overall is down just over 4% compared with last year. This it is about 2% more than a projection based on factors other than immigration enforcement.

Carvalho said fears in immigrant communities “are now exacerbating preexisting factors that were already driving statewide enrollment declines — including falling birth rates, rising housing costs and broader economic pressures.”

In a school system with nearly 400,000 students, the difference this year between the anticipated decline and the actual decline is more than 7,000 students.

An indicator that speaks to the effect of immigration enforcement is the number of “newcomer” students.

Newcomers are defined as non-U.S.-born students enrolled for three or fewer years in any U.S. school. This is an educational category, not an indication of whether a student resides legally in the country. California schools do not collect information about legal status — and a 1982 Supreme Court decision protects the right of immigrant children to receive a public education.

In 2023-24, L.A. Unified had 21,997 newcomers by the end of the school year, accounting for 5.2% of students. The end-of-year total for last year was 19,110 students — 4.7% of total enrollment and a decrease of 2,887 from the previous year.

At that point, President Trump had been in office for about six months — with a surge in immigration raids in Los Angeles spiking in June.

The enrollment trend continued this fall, with recent data showing an additional decline of 1,768 newcomers, bringing their enrollment to 17,342 and reducing newcomers to 4.4% of total enrollment.

“While newcomers have historically been a vibrant and growing part of our school communities, their enrollment has declined significantly over the past three years, with year-over-year decreases that mirror the uncertainty many families are living through,” Carvalho said.

The mother of the Roybal student was detained during a summer raid at the Vernon factory where she worked and then quickly deported, Cardona said. The student is staying with relatives and, with support from the school, remains in classes. But she also has to help care for two younger siblings and feels pressure to get a job.

“It’s distressing to us when she says that she’s going to have to drop out of school,” Cardona said. “It’s obvious that she is good at it and works hard at it, but she’s just preoccupied with ensuring that there’s funds so her siblings can reunite with her mom.”

District data suggest that many newcomers who were expected to return have not done so.

At the end of the 2024–25 school year, after accounting for graduates and families known to have relocated, 18,232 newcomer students were enrolled and expected to return this fall. Of these, 16,668 returned, 8.5% lower than anticipated.

Widespread effect on newcomer students

In San Diego, Principal Fernando Hernandez has enrolled dozens of newcomer students from across Latin America over the last couple of years. Many made the treacherous journey through the jungles of the Darien Gap before setting up camp in a park near the Perkins K-8 school.

About a third of students at the school are homeless. Staffers have become experts on supporting kids who are facing adversity.

But so far this school year, he hasn’t enrolled a single newcomer. Other families did not return when the new school year began. Overall, the district’s enrollment is on par with last year’s, according to a spokesperson. But at Hernandez’s school, the change is noticeable.

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County Public Schools — formerly led by Carvalho — about 2,550 students have entered the district from another country so far this school year — down from nearly 14,000 last year, and more than 20,000 the year before that. School board member Luisa Santos, who attended district schools, said the trend is “a sad reality.”

“I was one of those arrivals when I was 8 years old,” Santos said. “And this country and our public schools — I’ll never get tired of saying it — gave me everything.”

Collectively, the enrollment declines in Miami-Dade erased about $70 million from the district’s budget, forcing administrators to scramble to cover the unexpected shortfall.

In northern Alabama, Albertville City Schools Supt. Bart Reeves said the district’s newcomer academy at a local high school hasn’t been enrolling any new students. Reeves’ district is home to one of Alabama’s largest Latino student populations, about 60% of all students.

Reeves said he expects the hit to his budget from enrollment declines will cost him about 12 teacher positions.

Denver Public Schools enrolled 400 new-to-country students in the summer, compared with 1,500 during the previous summer. Outside Chicago, Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 signed up 100 fewer new immigrant students. The Houston Independent School District shuttered the Las Americas Newcomer School, a program dedicated to children who are new to the U.S., after its enrollment fell to 21 students from 111 last year.

In California, the financial effect of enrollment decreases are expected to hit hardest in later years. But unexpected enrollment losses can immediately force schools to reduce their teaching staff and combine classes a month or more into the school year.

Missing 200 students in Inglewood

At the Inglewood Unified School District, about 200 of the newest newcomers did not show up as anticipated, a drop of more than 50% in a school system with about 6,000 students.

In 2023-24, Inglewood Unified enrolled 391 students living in the U.S. a year or less. The following year that number was 312. This year the number is 109.

As with L.A. Unified, the Inglewood district had planned for declining enrollment, but the drop was steeper than expected.

“I’m really worried about those 200 kids who aren’t here,” said Inglewood Supt. Jim Morris. “That really is alarming data.”

For the students in school, overall district attendance has improved slightly, part of a districtwide push to get all students to class more often.

“It’s critically important that students and families know that the school is a place that they can trust, that the school is a place where they’re safe, and that the school is a place where whatever needs they have — we’re going to do our best to meet those needs,” Morris said.

In L.A. Unified similar efforts are underway, including at Roybal, where a few students are being picked up by bus directly from home to quell fears over ongoing immigration enforcement.

“Our responsibility is to ensure every child — regardless of where they were born — feels safe in our schools,” Carvalho said. “We will continue to stand firmly with our immigrant communities and protect every student’s right to a welcoming, stable and supportive education.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2b81a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F75%2Ff1f0558b4cce9a5f4e7c9c0e8798%2Fla-photos-1staff-464309-me-0829-csu-math-10-cmc.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:57:09.348333

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: ""You may hear people say, 'Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.
He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump's sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration's crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, ""was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,"" said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. ""But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.""

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.""

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

The shooting sparks anti-immigrant rhetoric

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal ""should have never been allowed to come here,"" Trump called lax migration policies ""the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,"" and Vice President JD Vance said Biden's policy was ""opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.""

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration"" from a list of nearly 20 countries, ""terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,"" and ""remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States."" Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

""They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,"" said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: ""You may hear people say, 'Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump's problem.' That's not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.""

Afghans in the US fearful for their status

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called ""a hellhole on Earth"" on Thursday.

""These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What's new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

""Life was finally getting easier for me. I've learned to speak English. I found a better job,"" he said. ""But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they're now looking at me the same way as the shooter.""

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an ""extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,"" he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

""It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,"" he added.

That's going to be the number one category that's targeted by a broad-based absolute ban on legal immigration to the United States.
Liz Landers: David Bier from the Cato Institute, thank you so much for joining us this evening this holiday weekend.","Liz Landers:

OK, let's start with some of these social media posts from the president.

He wrote last night in a pair of posts demeaning immigrants and calling the country's immigration policies stupid. What's your reaction to that?

David Bier:

Well, first of all, this was a horrific attack. No one condones it. This is an individual who should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Unfortunately, what the president has taken away from this attack is that all of 53 million, as he says, immigrants to the United States, legal or illegal, are now seen as suspicious, as people who should be driven out of the United States, even denaturalized.

If you look at the rhetoric in that post, he can't find a single good thing to say about any of the immigrants from any country in the world. And that's really what's different. What I see here is, the president has for a long time talked about the problems with certain types of immigration, with illegal immigration, with refugees and others.

But this was really the broadest attack that I can remember on the immigrant population overall, both legal and illegal, even the naturalized citizens who have taken the oath to the Constitution of the United States.

Liz Landers:

Trump's post had a series of pledged reforms, including, but not limited to a permanent pause on migration from all Third World countries. We heard that a few moments ago.

Remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States. End all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens and denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.

How much of that can he follow through on?

David Bier:

Well, certainly, he's already trying to carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in the history of the United States. He wants to deport millions and millions of people who are here illegally.

So now he's just adding to that campaign promise with trying to deport people who are in the country legally. Now, taking away someone who has illegal permanent residence, their status, is quite difficult. You have to prove your case against them. You have to bring that before an immigration judge and layout exactly what immigration law they violated.

And what he's talking about here, net asset, all this stuff, there is some ambiguity in the law, but there's not that much ambiguity, and it will be difficult for him to actually follow through on that promise and effectively deport most of the legal immigrants in the United States.

Liz Landers:

The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, is saying that his agency is going to issue proposed regulations clarifying that the refunded portions of certain individual income tax benefits are no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens.

What benefits do those without legal status receive? And do we know whether what Bessent posted about will have any substantial impact?

David Bier:

Usually, these benefits are based on the Social Security numbers that are available to them. So, you submit your application for benefits along with your income tax return, checking that box that you have a Social Security number that is work-eligible, which is the basis for the refund or otherwise.

So I certainly support this type of proposal in terms of policy. Unfortunately, Congress is the one who sets the rules for this, and they just went through this tax reform bill that they put forward and they didn't go all the way with this idea effectively barring most noncitizens from those.

And so really what he's advocating for is Congress to change the law. We will see if that happens.

Liz Landers:

What trends have we seen in immigration recently? And what impact could these changes that we're seeing from the president being proposed, what could those have — impact on these immigration trends we're seeing?

David Bier:

Well, ultimately, the president's proposals from day one have been to restrict legal immigration. He's come out with a number of different ideas on those lines, including the total shutdown of the refugee program, a ban on most immigration from 19 different countries, restrictions on the H-1B high-skilled visa.

So, across all the different categories of immigration that we have, he's looking to restrict. This is the first time he's said an outright ban. And when you think about who gets most legal immigrant visas to come to the United States, it is spouses of U.S. citizens.

That's going to be the number one category that's targeted by a broad-based absolute ban on legal immigration to the United States. And that's really cutting at the heart of family values and a lot of the other things that conservatives like to talk about.

Inspector-general reports later confirmed that individuals with security flags nonetheless entered the United States.
In those cases, the United States has no basis to assume the risk at all.
These are hybrid-threat network-driven movements that the United States cannot map, measure, or vet.","A day after two National Guard soldiers were shot, one fatally, in a “barbaric terrorist attack” in Washington, DC, President Trump declared that the United States will “permanently pause migration from all Third World countries”. The announcement landed just days after the US State Department issued an unprecedented statement, explaining that “mass migration poses an existential threat to Western civilization and undermines the stability of key American allies.”

Under new guidance, US embassies must now report the human-rights impacts of mass migration on receiving nations. These include crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assault patterns, community displacement, political retaliation against citizens who oppose mass migration, and two-tiered justice systems emerging for illegal immigrant offenders. This is a historic reframing. For the first time, mass migration is formally recognised as a human-rights issue for host societies, and sovereign governments are acknowledged to have the right — and obligation — to protect their people.

The suspected DC attacker, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, arrived in the US during the 2021 Kabul evacuation under Operation Allies Welcome and was granted asylum in April 2025 after claiming he had served alongside American forces in Kandahar. That credential was accepted as sufficient proof that he posed no threat.

Clearly, he did. As National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) Director Joe Kent put it: “It is true that the terrorist who conducted the attack in D.C. was ‘vetted’ by the intelligence community, however he was only vetted to serve as a soldier to fight against the Taliban, AQ, & ISIS IN Afghanistan.” Kent went on: “He was NOT vetted for his suitability to come to America and live among us as a neighbor, integrate into our communities, or eventually become an American citizen.”

After Afghanistan collapsed, true vetting was impossible. Civil registries were unreliable even before Kabul fell. Afterwards, the US lost access entirely. Tens of thousands of evacuees were processed using fragmented or outdated data systems incapable of verifying identity, criminal history, or network affiliation. Inspector-general reports later confirmed that individuals with security flags nonetheless entered the United States.

The Trump administration has now announced a nationwide halt on all asylum decisions, and has instructed officers to apply “country-specific factors” for nationals from 19 high-risk nations. Beyond those 19 nations, the administration will almost certainly replace the informal term “Third World” with a defined list grounded in national-security findings. The issue is not income level or geography — it is whether a country can provide reliable identity, criminal, and security data. Many cannot. This is especially true for states dominated by cartels, transnational criminal organisations (TCOs), jihadist networks, or foreign intelligence proxies. In those cases, the United States has no basis to assume the risk at all.

Mass immigration flows deepen the challenge. Cartels, CCP-linked triads, Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, and foreign intelligence services increasingly control migration pipelines, using debt bondage and coercion to compel illegal immigrants into labour, sex trafficking, and revenue generation. Illegal populations become sub-governed communities, extensions of the networks that moved them. Every illegal immigrant is a financial asset and operational tool for these organisations. These are hybrid-threat network-driven movements that the United States cannot map, measure, or vet.

However, US law is built for moments like this. Under §212(f), a president may suspend “any class of aliens” whose entry is detrimental to national interests — a power upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018’s Trump v. Hawaii. And so the question before the country is simple: how can a state protect its citizens when it cannot verify who is entering or which foreign adversarial networks they belong to?

When a nation can no longer see, the first duty is to stop moving forward blindly. Recent US immigration policy has been misguided and far too lenient. Under such conditions, a pause is not a political statement: it is the minimum threshold of national security.",https://unherd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247361430.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 13:57:21.174311

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan war, is facing first-degree murder charges in connection with Wednesday’s shooting. The suspect arrived in the U.S. as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Trump’s latest posts threaten a new wave of severe consequences for people his administration deems illegal, including to “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

The president also vowed to “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility” and “deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” before claiming, without evidence, that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone,” he wrote.

There were roughly 80,000 Somali nationals living in Minnesota in 2023, according to Minnesota Compass, out of a population of nearly 6 million people in the state.

Trump’s remarks about Somalis in Minnesota come after several instances of fraud were uncovered in state programs, including by Somali residents.

Republican members of Congress highlighted those claims in a letter last week seeking an investigation into the funnelling of “taxpayer dollars into the hands of the Al-Shabaab terrorist network in Somalia.”

Khalid Omar, an organizer with the interfaith group ISAIAH, said to the Guardian: “Collective punishment is wrong and racist, and using the actions of a few people to attack an entire community is un-American.”

“If anyone, regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity, committed fraud, they should be held accountable under the law as individuals,” he continued.

Trump’s remarks also drew criticism from UN agencies.

Asked to respond to Trump’s remarks about immigrants, UN human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

UN refugee agency spokesperson Eujin Byun echoed those sentiments.

“When people who need protection arrive in their territory, they have to have a due process of asylum. And then they have to have access to territory,” she said, adding that the overwhelming majority of refugees are law-abiding members of the host community.

Since Trump took office in January, his administration has deployed ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents to multiple American cities and have detained tens of thousands of foreign nationals.

In his recent post, Trump claimed — again, without evidence — that “most” of the 53 million foreign nationals currently living in the United States are “on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.”

As of Nov. 16, there were 65,135 people in ICE detention, 73.6 per cent of whom have no criminal record, according to Trac Immigration.

In 2023, the most recent year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce, including about 23 million lawful immigrants and 10 million unauthorized immigrants, the research centre says.

Unauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status, including people with temporary protection from deportation and those with various forms of legal work permits.

Among the unauthorized immigrants with some deportation protections were 2.6 million asylum applicants; 700,000 people who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole; 700,000 victims of crime and violence; 650,000 people with Temporary Protected Status and 600,000 immigrants protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Afghan man accused of shooting two National Guard members will face first-degree murder charges for an attack that prompted President Donald Trump to declare he would freeze migration from “Third World Countries” to the U.S.

U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro, said on Friday that there will be other charges as well against 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who she said ambushed the National Guardsmen from West Virginia near the White House on Wednesday.

In a Thanksgiving call with U.S. military service members on Thursday Trump called the shootings a “terrorist attack” and officials have said they were conducting a terrorism probe into Wednesday’s shooting.

“What happened at that crime is unmistakable. It is a premeditated murder,” Pirro told Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” program. “We are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” she said.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds on Thursday. Pirro told Fox that Beckstrom’s fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was in critical condition.

On his Truth Social platform late Thursday, Trump escalated his rhetoric on immigration. Since taking office this year he has stepped up arrests of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, cracked down on unlawful border crossings and stripped legal status from hundreds of thousands of people.

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” Trump said on Truth Social, referring to his predecessor.

After taking office in 2021, Biden reversed many of Trump’s restrictive immigration policies from his first term, saying they blocked people in need of humanitarian protection and were unfairly discriminatory.

Trump did not name any countries. Asked about “Third World” countries, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Friday referred Reuters to 19 countries listed in a June travel ban.

Earlier, Homeland Security officials had said Trump ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the Biden administration and green cards issued to citizens of the 19 countries, which include Afghanistan.

SHOOTING PROMPTS SWEEPING MIGRATION REVIEWS

Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era immigration program to resettle thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war and feared reprisal from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal.

More than 70,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under the program. Officials said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. He was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.

Investigators said Lakanwal drove across the country from his home in the state of Washington and shot the two Guardsmen with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops.

The shootings may give Trump an opening to argue that even legal pathways like asylum pose security risks for Americans.

Less than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies.

Lakanwal lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, according to investigators. Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect’s wife and five children who live in Washington state, Trump has said, “We’re looking at the whole situation with family.”

INTERNATIONAL GROUPS DEFEND ASYLUM SEEKER RIGHTS

U.N. agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country and to be given due process.

“We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, told Reuters.

U.N. human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

Jasmin Lilian Diab, director of the Institute for Migration at the Lebanese American University, said freezing Afghan applications or reconsidering thousands of approved asylum claims would disrupt families and local communities and erode the integrity of the migration system.

“While the recent incident is tragic, using an isolated incident to justify mass restrictions is inconsistent with evidence showing no link between refugee arrivals and increased crime,” Diab told Reuters.

But President Donald Trump’s administration doubled down, and more high-profile raids followed as the White House sought to make good on the president’s promise to conduct the largest mass deportation program in the nation’s history.

Immigration agents have since conducted sweeps at construction sites, restaurants, factories, car washes, and farms, upending life for undocumented workers nationwide. California estimates that nearly 1.5 million undocumented workers call the state home.

As militarized crackdowns have become more common in many parts of the country, employers and unions alike have taken new steps to protect their workers. In industries ranging from farmwork to garment production to food service, they have begun organizing defenses to make it harder for ICE to identify, detain and deport unauthorized immigrant employees who help keep their workplaces in business.

While the strategies vary, they share common goals: to find ways to inform immigrant workers about threats and, when possible, to shield them from detainment and deportation.

Adopt a Corner

On Aug. 6, day laborers gathered in front of the same Home Depot in Los Angeles that had been raided two months earlier. Tensions were still high in the city with ongoing ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) actions, but the workers needed some income.

Suddenly, the back door of a Penske rental truck slid open from the inside to reveal nearly a dozen CBP agents in body armor lying in wait. They surged toward unsuspecting laborers, many of whom scattered in fear.

The raid, dubbed “Operation Trojan Horse” by the Department of Homeland Security and captured on camera by a Fox News reporter embedded with the agents inside the truck, resulted in the arrests of more than a dozen undocumented immigrants.

Similar raids earlier in the year inspired the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, a labor group that advocates for improved working conditions, to create the “Adopt a Corner” campaign.

Jose Madera, the director of the NDLON-affiliated Pasadena Community Job Center, said that the campaign encourages volunteers to go to places where immigrants regularly gather in search of work, to teach people about their rights. So far, volunteers have visited more than 100 locations across the country, Madera said.

The group’s volunteers hand out “Know Your Rights” materials like red cards, which are pocket-sized cutouts that explain what anyone — regardless of immigration status — can do when confronted by an immigration officer. But since ICE officers frequently violate immigrants’ rights, Madera alleged, people who adopt a corner can help workers in a more immediate way.

The Pasadena Community Job Center also tells people in the community to record actions by authorities on cell phones so that when there is a raid, “there can be someone documenting the abuse, the violence, people’s constitutional rights being violated,” Madera said.

Organizers hope that documentation can serve both as evidence in lawsuits or in immigration courts, and as proof to show the public how the Trump administration is conducting immigration enforcement operations.

“Many Americans do not want to see this type of violence — masked men in unmarked cars, armed to the teeth, going into communities and causing this terror,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Capital & Main’s requests for comment.

In the Fields

Federal agents staged massive immigration raids on a pair of California cannabis farms in the cities of Carpinteria and Camarillo on July 10, blocking roads with armored vehicles, launching tear gas and firing crowd control munitions at protesters.

Amid the chaos, Jaime Alanis Garcia — who had worked at Glass House Farms for a decade — was fleeing from immigration officers when he fell 30 feet from the roof of a greenhouse, fracturing his neck and skull, according to NBC. Two days later, he died.

At those raids, federal agents arrested 361 people including American citizen and U.S. Army veteran George Retes.

More than a quarter of the state’s large agricultural workforce is undocumented — and nearly two-thirds are immigrants, more generally — leaving hundreds of thousands of laborers vulnerable to immigration crackdowns at work.

Since even before the Glass House Farms raids, the United Farm Workers union has been reaching out to employers to suggest ways to protect their employees.

Elizabeth Strater, vice president of UFW, told Capital & Main that one of the simplest things farmers can do is put up gates and fences to keep intruders out. For large fields that are too difficult or costly to encircle, Strater recommends a more impromptu tactic that, ironically, is sometimes used by law enforcement.

“If you’re out in flat, open fields where you can’t put a gate, what you can do is have the foreman, or whoever, park their vehicle so that it prevents access (by) someone who may not have your workers’ best interest at heart,” Strater said.

Such physical barriers are critical, Strater said, because while undocumented workers are legally protected by constitutional and statutory rights, federal agents have repeatedly been recorded ignoring basic protections.

Undocumented workers “have a right not to answer questions, but what happens when they assert that right is these absolutely unhinged, untrained, uncontrolled agents smash their windows and drag them out of their cars,” Strater said. “The utter lawlessness on behalf of these agencies is just extreme.”

Beyond providing employers with resources, UFW has taken legal action against the DHS, which Strater said has helped reduce the number of indiscriminate raids on farmworkers in certain areas of California.

Still, federal agencies can obtain criminal warrants to go after workers at specific sites, according to Strater.

Not all farm owners are taking action in response to workplace raids, but Strater said that most, including nonunionized operations, have been receptive to UFW’s recommendations. Some have even hosted community meetings to develop plans that could lessen the impact of immigration enforcement on workers and, by extension, the businesses that employ them, some of which have been hit by labor shortages triggered by the raids.

The Factory Floor

Many clothing manufacturing businesses in Los Angeles have also been open to outreach aimed at protecting employees, according to Daisy Gonzalez, campaign director at the Garment Worker Center.

“It’s a new sort of reaction to us … Garment Worker Center is a workers’ rights organization, and often employers are not that receptive to that,” Gonzalez said. “But I think information about what to do in this moment, employers understand it’s a resource for both their workers and themselves.”

Since the high-profile raids in June, many of the Garment Worker Center’s members have been worried about being detained on the job. Some have opted to stay home from work — for months.

In response, Gonzalez said, the Garment Worker Center has significantly ramped up its mutual aid programs, providing financial assistance to affected employees and even delivering resources to home-bound workers.

One middle-aged undocumented worker in Los Angeles, who spoke to Capital & Main on the condition of anonymity for fear that immigration officials would detain him, said the garment factory where he was working closed permanently after immigration raids began. If it were not for the Garment Worker Center’s financial support, he added, he would not have been able to pay for food or rent.

“The raids have deeply affected me, both psychologically and economically,” he said in an interview in Spanish. “There’s panic in the streets. I try to leave the house as infrequently as I can. I speak for myself, but there are thousands of people just like me, many in worse situations…this is a national emergency.”

Undocumented immigrants aren’t the only ones potentially impacted by raids.

In September, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that DHS officers could detain people based on their race, their use of Spanish or accented English, their occupation or their presence at locations such as car washes, agricultural or day labor sites.

The result is that many immigrants with residency, U.S. citizens and their American-born children can get caught up in aggressive raids. To Gonzalez, “Anyone who has a darker skin tone, or speaks a different language, or works in an industry that might be where certain people expect undocumented immigrants to work, are all targets.”

Serve and Protect

On a busy street in L.A.’s Los Feliz neighborhood, customers line up to order tacos and burritos outside of a small hut. Yuca’s is a modest operation with no inside seating, but it has been in business for nearly half a century, becoming a staple of the city’s Mexican-food scene and even winning a prestigious James Beard Foundation Award.

Dora Herrera, the restaurant’s co-owner, delights in being able to serve her local community, but since the Trump administration’s ramped-up immigration raids began, she has worried intensely about Yuca’s customers, vendors and workers, whom she considers “family.”

Herrera sought advice from organizations like the Latino Restaurant Association about how to protect her staff, regardless of their immigration status, as she has seen reports of federal agents arresting U.S. citizens, green-card holders and immigrants with work permits.

She has provided her employees with Know Your Rights materials like red cards and, for the first time since the restaurant opened in 1976, installed signs on the outside of the building declaring it private property. The law requires officers to produce a warrant to gain access to private property.

“We haven’t been around for 50 years for nothing. You learn something, you adapt, and you keep adapting to make it work,” Herrera said.

Such measures are far from foolproof but, according to Herrera, it is incumbent on people like her to do what they can to keep vulnerable workers as safe as possible.

“We want to make sure everybody’s taken care of, protected, educated,” Herrera said. “As an employer, I believe you have to do everything, absolutely everything you can, to protect your people, even the smallest thing.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2232800116-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 11:57:17.457946

The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, “was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.”

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.”

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

The shooting sparks anti-immigrant rhetoric

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal “should have never been allowed to come here,” Trump called lax migration policies “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” and Vice President JD Vance said Biden’s policy was “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.”

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration” from a list of nearly 20 countries, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

“They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,” said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump’s problem.’ That’s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.”

Afghans in the US fearful for their status

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called “a hellhole on Earth” on Thursday.

“These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What’s new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

“Life was finally getting easier for me. I’ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,” he said. “But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they’re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.”

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an “extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,” he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

“It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,” he added.

McHenry County has filed suit against ICE, trying to get the federal government to pay for potential liability for allegedly making immigrant detainees do forced labor.

The court battle pits conservative McHenry County, which once fought in court for the ability to hold accused immigrants in the U.S. without legal permission in its jail, against the agency that once paid it millions of dollars every year to do so. Both county and federal officials have denied liability.

The case comes as the U.S. Supreme Court is considering whether private prisons can immediately appeal their claim of immunity against a rash of similar lawsuits across the nation.

Northwestern University professor Jacqueline Stevens, founding director of the Deportation Research Clinic at the Buffett Institute for Global Affairs, said the Supreme Court seemed skeptical of Geo Group’s claims regarding a prison it runs in Colorado. That might not bode well for a public jail like McHenry County as well.

But McHenry County Assistant State’s Attorney Troy Owens, who manages civil litigation for the county, said the lawsuit against the county should be dismissed.

“This is an absurd lawsuit,” Owens said. “The Trafficking Victims Protection Act is being grotesquely misused.”

County attorneys have argued in court that the courts have established housekeeping duties as an exception to the 13th Amendment prohibition against slavery. Prosecutors also argue that the county is immune from such lawsuits because no court has found that a government-run detention facility violates the law by requiring detainees to perform housekeeping.

“It’s not asking too much to ask them to clean up their cells and common areas,” Owens said.

About a dozen class-action lawsuits have been filed nationwide, including in Colorado, Georgia and New York, against ICE and its contractors, such as CoreCivic and the GEO Group, which run private prisons. Geo Group reported revenue of $2.4 billion last year, 41% of it from ICE contracts.

The suits generally claim that inmates were forced to clean, do maintenance and perform kitchen duties for little or no pay, in violation of minimum wage laws or the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.

The Supreme Court recently took GEO Group’s case, in which it claims it should have “derivative sovereign immunity,” similar to immunity that protects the government from certain liability, because it had a contract to work for the government.

The McHenry County state’s attorney’s office also is arguing that ICE, acting through its contractor, The Nakamoto Group, should cover any liability in the case because the jail was merely following ICE guidelines.

While the McHenry case, filed in 2022, remains in the early stage of gathering evidence to determine its scope, other such cases have involved millions of dollars. In Tacoma, Washington, a jury awarded plaintiffs $17 million in back wages, and GEO was ordered to pay the state nearly $6 million in unfair compensation, known as unjust enrichment. They pay detainees as little as $1 a day for duties that could otherwise be done at normal wages by public workers or private employees.

“My takeaway is that the kind of get-rich schemes some entities might have through mass detention might not work out as well as they planned,” Stevens said.

McHenry County’s detention of noncitizens for ICE while their cases were decided had been a point of contention for years. Activists had pressured the county to stop the practice, but the county board voted in 2021 to continue, saying it generated revenue and kept detainees closer to home. ICE paid the county $95 per day per detainee, for an average of 240 inmates a day from 2016 to 2021, which the suit stated generated more than $41 million.

But effective in 2021, Illinois lawmakers prohibited detention contracts with local authorities. McHenry County appealed in court but lost. Since then immigrant detainees have been held in facilities out of state or at the ICE processing facility in west suburban Broadview, where federal immigration agents recently clashed with protesters over its arrests of hundreds of immigrants during the Trump administration’s Operation Midway Blitz.

In 2022, six detainees filed suit against McHenry, claiming they were forced to clean and maintain the jail without pay or face discipline. Some of the plaintiffs were released, while others returned to the countries they left. While convicted felons can be forced to do work as part of their punishment, immigrant civil detainees waiting for a hearing cannot. McHenry officials said detainees weren’t forced to work, but were responsible for keeping their own cells and day areas clean.

Ultimately, the courts must decide whether entities operating under the direction of the federal government receive governmental immunity from litigation, or whether the federal government assumes liability.

McHenry County officials declined to comment on the litigation, but told the Tribune that before the state prohibited its ICE contract, it was receiving nearly $10 million a year for housing ICE detainees. While the county has temporarily contracted with neighboring counties to house their inmates, the agreements generate about half as much revenue as the ICE contract.

The Trump administration’s solicitor general argued in the Supreme Court case that if an agency delegates authority to perform an unlawful action, the contractor is still liable. The administration has also requested a record $45 billion over the next two years to expand immigrant detention capacity to more than 100,000 people, much of it through private prisons, which are prohibited in Illinois.

In other words, Stevens said, if ICE misinterprets laws Congress passes, its contractors are not immune from lawsuits.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ctc-l-detained-immigrants.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-29 10:57:19.472945

Why it matters: ICE has signed 1,100+ agreements this year for local law enforcement to cooperate on immigration arrests and detentions. The agency is dangling financial incentives from President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

The big picture: Almost 650 counties across the country are now covered by some form of the 287(g) agreement, a formal partnership between ICE and non-federal law enforcement, including sheriff's offices and state police, according to the latest data.

The surge in agreements is fueled by red states and new state laws mandating cooperation.

The Homeland Security Department recently announced that these local partners will also start aiding with vetting sponsors of migrant children with whom the Biden administration lost contact.

Zoom in: As of October, ICE is offering to reimburse for ""each eligible trained 287(g) officer"" their full salary, benefits and 25% of overtime pay.

There's also a merit-based bonus to the agencies based on ""successful location of illegal aliens provided by ICE and overall assistance."" The highest tier pays out $1,000.

Between the lines: There are three types of 287(g) agreements, named after a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as Axios wrote in June.

For agencies to identify and process immigrants subject to removal from the country following arrests.

For ICE to train and authorize law enforcement to serve and execute immigration warrants in jails.

For local agencies to enforce immigration laws in the community. It was phased out by the Obama administration and renewed by Trump.

Zoom out: ICE has been struggling to meet its hiring goals — aiming for 10,000 new agents — as new recruits fail the fitness assessments and immigration law tests.

The partnerships with already-trained local law enforcement have quickly brought more staff onto the immigration mission.

""ICE is not only supercharging our hiring, we are also multiplying partnerships with state and local law enforcement to remove the worst of the worst including murderers, gang members, rapists, terrorists, and pedophiles from our country,"" ICE's deputy director Madison Sheehan said in a statement.

The intrigue: Taxpayers in Maricopa County, Arizona are still footing the bill from a 2013 verdict that found Sheriff Joe Arpaio was racially profiling Latinos under a 287(g) agreement.

Community organizers have, in isolated cases, successfully pushed back against these agreements, including the ouster of a Bucks County sheriff over the issue in an election this November.

""Really the local cost is a huge issue,"" said Christine Sauve, of Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, who helped organize a successful pullback of two agreements in Michigan.

When residents first heard about the agreements, ""there was a real fear that their local police officers would become agents of a lawless immigration enforcement system,"" she added.

The bottom line: Florida has signed the most agreements at 337, as of Nov. 24, followed by Texas's 231.

Both states signed laws this year to require broad participation.

In nearly all of the examples Judge Ellis cited in her 200-plus page opinion, she says the Department of Homeland Security narrative contradicts the reality of what can be seen on agents' body-worn cameras.

The following are just a few examples from her ruling.

On September 26 outside of the Broadview ICE facility, video from an agent's body-worn camera shows a line of agents standing at least 30 feet away from protesters. Despite this distance, the agents start yelling ""move back, move back"" to the protesters and then shoot pepper balls and tear gas at them, all without any apparent justification, according to Judge Sara Ellis's 233-page opinion.

She said an agent wrote in his use of force report about this incident that protesters were ""becoming increasingly hostile."" However, Judge Ellis wrote in her opinion the video shows protesters were simply standing there when agents first deployed any force.

On October 4 in Brighton Park, footage shows an agent pushing a protestor to the ground. Then, tear gas and pepper balls are released. Judge Ellis wrote that only after tear gas, pepper balls and a protester was pushed to the ground by agents did protesters throw items, which ""does not support agents' use of force.""

In an incident the ABC 7 I-Team covered in Albany Park on October 12, Judge Ellis wrote that agents said in reports, and DHS publicized, that a bicyclist threw a bike at agents. But in a video, provided with no sound to start, she says it ""makes clear"" that agents first throw tear gas, then take a protester's bike throwing it and multiple other protesters to the ground after deploying tear gas.

Ellis also noted an agent is seen in redacted and blurred video from his body-worn camera in at least one instance using ChatGPT to write a use of force report, saying ""to the extent that agents use ChatGPT to create their use of force reports, this further undermines their credibility..."" Judge Ellis went on to say ""...it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything that Defendants represent.""

The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Judge Ellis's initial order while the Trump administration's appeal is heard.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.","WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump threatened a slew of aggressive actions to curtail legal migration to the U.S. in response to one National Guard member dying after being ambushed near the White House, though the scope of those moves and what legal or congressional mechanisms he may pursue remain unclear.

Trump, who has amplified his anti-immigration rhetoric in the wake of the shooting attack by an Afghan national, said late Thursday he would permanently pause migration from “all Third World Countries,” “terminate” what he called “illegal admissions” under former President Joe Biden and end federal benefits for noncitizens. The president also said he would deport foreign nationals deemed a security risk and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

The comments signal a renewed effort to sharply curtail even legal migration to the U.S. and scale up deportations of those already in the country. Trump’s administration, however, remained largely silent Friday on how any of those changes would be made, which countries would be targeted or how sweeping the actions could be – for instance, whether the president aims to deport significant numbers of people with legal status or even citizenship by denaturalizing them, as he put it.

On Friday, Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow said in a social media post that the U.S. is halting all asylum decisions “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

The agency earlier announced it would review green cards of people from “countries of concern,” potentially widening efforts to remove legal permanent residents. Those countries are the 19 listed in a travel ban from earlier this year but whether the “third world” nations Trump cited match that list is not clear.

The travel ban imposed in June restricted travel by foreign nationals from 12 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa, from entering the U.S., citing the need to counter the threat of terrorist attacks and safeguard the public. Those countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Another seven countries faced partial restrictions.

Federal authorities have identified the suspected shooter as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who previously worked with U.S. forces and the CIA before arriving in the U.S. in 2021, intensifying scrutiny on the more than 190,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. since the fall of Kabul to the Taliban. Most of those comprise people who assisted U.S. forces during the war and their families.

Since the shooting, the president has claimed Afghan evacuees received no vetting, waving a photo of one departure flight while speaking to the media Thursday. He’s also said Lakanwal simply “went cuckoo” even as the investigation into the gunman’s motives continues.

While the Trump administration has cast blame on the Biden team, Lakanwal was granted asylum by the Trump administration, according to AfghanEvac, a nonprofit group, and would have undergone vetting, including for his work alongside U.S. forces fighting the Taliban. Advocacy groups have called on Lakanwal to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law and without his case negatively affecting other Afghans in the U.S.

Even before this week’s shooting, the administration aggressively moved to slash legal migration or travel to the U.S., offering some insight into their priorities. Trump has dramatically lowered the refugee cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by high-skilled workers and revoked thousands of visas.

The administration is also planning to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden.

“If you’re not someone who loves this country, if you’re not any benefit to this country, then we’re going to send you out of this country,” top Trump adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News Wednesday.

The June travel ban reinstated one of the most controversial measures from Trump’s first term, which went through numerous iterations and a protracted court fight before ultimately being upheld by the Supreme Court as “squarely within the scope of Presidential authority.”

Trump said the latest ban protects the nation from terrorist attacks and public safety threats. The administration has said the 12 countries on the new list facing full bans were chosen because they pose a “very high” terrorism or national security risk to the U.S. and had deficient screening and vetting processes. The seven countries where travelers face a partial ban were chosen because they posed a “high” risk.

Officials over the holiday weekend sought to quickly signal they were acting on Trump’s threats, adding to confusion over what new steps the administration was taking.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said his department would issue regulations clarifying that refunds for certain income tax benefits were “no longer available to illegal and other non-qualified aliens,” a plan the agency already announced the previous week, before the shooting.

Trump on Thursday night also called for “reverse migration,” but without detailing what that would entail.

Any new immigration moves by the president are likely to draw legal challenges.

The administration is already facing claims it is removing migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections. Multiple lawsuits in federal court allege wrongful deportation, including a transgender woman sent to Mexico despite an immigration judge’s order blocking the move because of her risk of being tortured or killed, and the ongoing case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant from El Salvador who sued to challenge his mistaken deportation to his home country.

The Justice Department has admitted authorities made mistakes in several deportation cases, which could hinder future removal attempts. A federal judge is pressing ahead with an inquiry into whether Trump administration officials willfully defied his orders to turn planes around that were en route to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

Many of the legal challenges to Trump immigration policies have been successful.

Moreover, as immigration rates have risen in the past few decades, crime rates across the country have fallen dramatically.
During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335.
This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.
“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added.","Donald Trump’s hateful, falsehood-filled rant on Thursday blaming immigrants for crime, “social dysfunction” and economic hardship is refuted by a wide range of immigration statistics, which show clearly that immigrants dramatically bolster the US economy and commit crimes at far lower rates than people born in the US.

On Thursday evening, Trump condemned immigrants in a broad and vicious invective, painting them as “illegal and disruptive populations” and attacking “those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for”. He vowed to block all migration from “third world countries” to allow the “US system to fully recover”.

The president’s post follows a deadly shooting in Washington DC on Wednesday in which one National Guard member was injured and another killed by a 29-year old Afghan national who assisted the US military effort in Afghanistan and was evacuated to the US after the American military withdrew.

The shooting has sparked even more anti-immigration rhetoric from Trump’s administration, which has indicated it will further intensify its crackdown on immigrant communities - already a focal point of fierce opposition from civil rights groups, Democratic lawmakers and the public.

Since the shooting took place, Trump has vowed to conduct a comprehensive review of asylum cases and green cards issued to people from certain countries.

The unprecedented post from a US president – spiteful even by Trump’s standards contradicted extensive research showing irrefutably that immigrants to the US commit fewer crimes than people born there, and have done so for more than a century.

Despite Trump’s post, in which he claims incorrectly that 53 million people in the US – “most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels” – are contributing to “high crime”, economists have found that the immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated compared to individuals born in the US. This trend has remained consistent for the past 150 years.

Moreover, as immigration rates have risen in the past few decades, crime rates across the country have fallen dramatically. According to an analysis by the American Immigration Council (AIC), the immigrant share of the US population has more than doubled since 1980, rising from 6.2% in that year to 13.9% in 2022. During the same period, the overall crime rate dropped by 60.4%, from 5,900 crimes per 100,000 people to 2,335. This includes a 34.5% decrease in violent crime and a 63.3% reduction in property crime.

In his post, Trump also claimed that immigrants and their children “are supported through massive payments from patriotic American citizens who … put up with what has happened to our country, but it’s eating them alive to do so”.

“A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family,” Trump added.

His claim is flatly contradicted by data showing that immigrants are significant contributors to the US economy. In 2023, undocumented immigrant households contributed $89.8bn in federal, state and local taxes, while holding $299bn in spending power, according to the AIC.

The organization also found that the vast majority of immigrants are not dependent on state governments to guarantee housing. Instead, in 2023, immigrant households paid more than $167bn in rent in the housing market and held over $6.6tn in housing wealth.

Trump, who also asserted that “this refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America”, singled out with particular malice what he described as “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia [who] are taking over the once great state of Minnesota”.

“Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for ‘prey,’” the US president said.

He added, with open racism, that Ilhan Omar – a member of Congress from Minnesota – was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab” and suggested she had married her brother.

Home to the largest Somali population in the US, many of whom arrived as refugees fleeing famine and civil war, Minnesota was labelled a “sanctuary jurisdiction” by the justice department in August . According to the department, this designation applies to states, cities or counties with laws that “hinder the enforcement of federal immigration laws”.

Trump has previously accused immigrants of “poisoning the blood of our country”, but despite repeatedly claiming that his immigration raids are targeting criminals across the country, a new study from the Cato Institute found that 73% of people detained by ICE have no convictions.

It also found that nearly half had no criminal conviction nor even any pending criminal charges and that only 5% had a violent criminal conviction.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f44a49cbed72353a210739d4c2d98273a2b44a96/62_0_4298_3438/master/4298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=edea911811e5d76982f3ded219ab51e8",N,,2025-11-29 08:56:44.630304

""Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions.","Advocates for refugees in the United States continued to raise alarm Friday after President Donald Trump moved quickly to exploit the murder of one National Guard soldier and the wounding of another—allegedly shot by a national from Afghanistan who worked for the US military and CIA during the war there before seeking asylum in the US—by issuing a sweeping ban against asylum-seekers and halting all immigration from what he termed ""all Third World countries"" in response to Wednesday's shooting in Washington, DC.

“Regardless of the alleged perpetrator’s nationality, religion or specific legal status,"" said Matthew Soerens, a vice president with the faith-based World Relief, speaking with the Associated Press, ""we urge our country to recognize these evil actions as those of one person, not to unfairly judge others who happen to share those same characteristics.”

Shawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the US during the war in Afghanistan, explained to the AP that many people in the Afghan refugee community that he knows are terrified by the tone which has been set by Trump after the shooting, afraid to leave their homes for fear of being snatched up by federal agents or otherwise targeted.

“They’re terrified. It’s insane,” VanDiver told AP. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn’t represent all Afghans. He represents himself.”

""The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual."" —Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan

On Thursday, it was announced that Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, deployed with the National Guard under orders from Trump, had died from her injuries while Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remained in critical condition in a local hospital.

While heartbreak and mourning were widely shared for the victims of the shooting, Trump's xenophobic response to the violent assault, including his racist social media posts on Truth Social that critics said echoed white nationalist rhetoric, proved, for many observers, once again his shortcomings as a national leader during times of crisis, but also as a human being.

""The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual,"" said Richard Bennett, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, on Thursday. ""That would be terribly unjust and complete nonsense. Cool heads must prevail.""

Arash Azizzada, co-director of Afghans For A Better Tomorrow, which long-opposed the US war in Afghanistan in the wake of 9/11 and continues to advocate on behalf of the Afghan-American community, condemned Trump for ""using this tragedy as a pretext to demonize, criminalize, and target an entire community. Exploiting a single incident to cast suspicion on Afghans—people who have already endured decades of displacement and America's forever wars—is both irresponsible and cruel.""

Azizzada also pointed out how the alleged gunman now in police custody, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, ""worked alongside US Special Operations forces and served in a CIA-backed covert paramilitary group known as 'Zero Units' that functioned outside the purview of any accountability and has a documented history of widespread human rights abuses against Afghan civilians over two decades.""

""We both condemn the violence by one individual on the streets of Washington, DC, as well as the violence perpetrated by the US in Afghanistan and elsewhere,"" said Azizzada. ""America must confront the decades of violence it inflicted on Afghanistan and acknowledge that its forever wars are a major reason why Afghans seek safety here. Blaming refugees for the consequences of those actions is unjust, and we call for the promises to Afghans to be honored, not abandoned.""

Journalist Ryan Grim, co-founder of Drop Site News, put it this way: ""The idea that we should freeze all migration because one of the CIA’s death squad recruits went on a rampage is absurd. Smarter would be to stop training death squads.""

Evacuate Our Allies, a group that advocates on behalf of Afghans who helped the US during the war and now seeking to resettle, expressed deep sympathies for the victims of the shooting and their families and condemned the ""reprehensible attack."" The group also denounced the ""alarming vilification of an entire community based on the actions of a lone individual.""

""No community, Afghan or otherwise, should be judged, demonized, or collectively punished for the behavior of one person,"" the group said. ""Such narratives cause real harm, inflame tensions, and overlook the truth: one individual does not represent millions. Collective blame is not only unjust but dangerous.

Obtaining court transcripts can cost thousands of dollars for a single day of proceedings, but the documents can contain errors, missing text, and even wrong attribution, frustrating legal practitioners who say the flaws impede justice.

Justice is being obstructed by inaccurate court transcripts — including some where potentially prejudicial comments by judges were missing, according to a slew of legal practitioners interviewed by the ABC.

The prohibitive cost of obtaining transcripts also meant some appeals were not even being considered, lawyers warned.

There are now calls for change, including the cancellation of a lucrative contract with the foreign company that provides the transcripts, and for the raw audio files to be provided to litigants as a matter of course.

The ABC spoke to nine legal practitioners for this story but four declined to go on the record — some saying they feared that speaking out could lead to reprisals from judges in ongoing or subsequent court cases.

Four practitioners said erroneous transcripts in cases they had worked on affected how their cases progressed.

Some said inappropriate or biased comments from the judge were missing from the transcript, making it impossible to lodge an appeal on those grounds.

Transcripts seen by the ABC attributed dialogue to the wrong person, named the wrong legal practitioners, contained an abundance of typographical errors, and one transcript had more than two hours of proceedings missing entirely.

The court later included the missing hours of dialogue, which totalled 29 pages, after a parent in the matter raised it with the judge's associate.

According to the parent, more than one transcript in their case contained errors, forcing them to repeatedly raise it with the court, and ultimately, hindering their case.

Family law barrister Brian Kelly said in his 18 years of practice he had worked on several matters where he believed the court transcripts were wrong.

""There have been times I have reviewed transcripts I have ordered and found that they did not line up with my recollection or my notes,"" he said.

""During an interim hearing some time ago the judge made comments that I felt demonstrated an error.

""I found that the relevant section [of the transcript] I required to base an appeal on was missing.

""Without going around the loop of having the transcript reviewed, for which the client had no funds … the appeal prospects dropped markedly.""

Mr Kelly said he decided not to make a formal complaint to the court or the Attorney General. Colleagues who experienced similar issues told him they were ""hesitant to make a formal complaint because of retribution"".

""Colleagues have told me they've been aware of transcripts that haven't lined up with what they thought was in there or what their notes have said, and they haven't made any complaints either because often you have to worry about the repercussions on your client and also on the lawyers themselves,"" he said.

""If a case is still ongoing and someone has challenged the veracity of a transcript and made a complaint about it, there might be repercussions in how that case continues.""

Former New South Wales Court of Appeals judge and chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, Anthony Whealy KC, said the issue threatened to undermine the administration of justice.

""If there's an example of a judge deliberately arranging to omit material in some form of self-preservation, then I think I would describe it as an unpardonable breach. It's totally contrary to the oath the judge takes and it's absolutely contrary to every principle of judicial correctness, and to me, deplorable,"" he said.

""If there are errors and omissions then the whole system is threatened and undermined and you could encounter a serious flaw in the administration of justice.""

'I'm deeply troubled'

If the contents of a transcript are disputed, a request can be made to review it against the audio file, but recordings ""are only available in exceptional circumstances"", according to the Federal Circuit and Family Court (FCFC) website.

The court uses a transcription company called VIQ Solutions — a prominent agency that provides services to hundreds of bodies around the world including media outlets, law enforcement, government agencies and insurance companies, according to its website.

VIQ Solutions also provides transcripts for the family court in the United Kingdom, where similar concerns have been raised regarding the quality and accuracy of transcripts.

UK family law barrister Charlotte Proudman said in order for justice to be done, and to address inaccuracies, courts must allow access to audio files of proceedings — not just written transcripts.

""It is absolutely imperative that transcripts and the audio of court hearings are made available to the parties in proceedings … and I do not think there is any legal justification for refusing parties having access to effectively their own data,"" Dr Proudman said.

""To deny them the opportunity to receive that audio, I would say is hindering justice.

The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) highlighted the call for access to audio files as part of their 2021 report into judicial impartiality.

It stated, ""stakeholders suggested that transcripts often do not pick up the subtle ways in which bias can manifest in the courtroom. For example, the transcript does not pick up facial expressions, long pauses, inflexion, or tone"".

Dr Proudman agreed, saying without the audio it was difficult for parties in a family law matter to prove if a judge had ""crossed the line"".

""You need the audio in order to understand the tone as well as the volume, the way that it's said. We know that things can be said in a very sarcastic way,"" she said.

""I had a case recently where a mother on the transcript was saying to the judge, 'I just don't think you understand coercive and controlling behaviour' … and she said he was getting quite irate and his volume was raised … she said, 'you're not letting me finish, you're cutting me off. I can see from your facial expression you're not happy'.

""He was saying, 'I'm not cutting you off, I'm not raising my voice', so batted it back. So, without the audio there is no objective, neutral or impartial observer to be able to decide whether in fact he had crossed the line to a perception of bias.""

In a matter in the family court of Australia in 2020, the appeal court relied on the audio files in a case where the primary judge's conduct was found to be ""cruel, insulting, humiliating and rude"".

""Having listened to the audio version of the transcript we are struck by the stark difference in the primary judge's tone and terms of address,"" the appeal judges stated.

The appeal court found the conduct of the judge warranted a retrial on the grounds of apprehended bias ""lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined"".

Mr Whealy said while appeal courts relied almost entirely on transcripts, audio files allowed a better understanding of the ""atmosphere"" of the courtroom.

""The audio file will … give you a much better picture of the whole atmosphere of the courtroom, you know, was the judge shouting at one of the witnesses? What may appear on paper to be just a quite banal comment might sound very different when listened to in real life.""

Why is it so hard to access audio files?

Legal practitioners told the ABC the process of seeking a review of the transcript against the audio file was too complicated, too costly for litigants, and requests to access the audio files were rarely granted.

The ABC is aware of a case in which a self-represented parent requested that transcripts be reviewed due to alleged inaccuracies but was denied.

The parent claimed the judge had repeatedly yelled at and spoken over the top of them.

One of the transcripts showed the judge threatened to ""strike out the proceedings"" when the parent raised issues of procedural fairness in what was a complex and long-running case.

An ABC journalist in the court room on one of the days this matter was heard witnessed very tense interactions between the judge and the parent which included raised voices, interruptions, speaking over, and allegations of eye rolling.

During the course of the proceedings the parent applied for the judge's recusal on the basis of bias but the application to have the case heard by another judge was refused.

""Transcripts are the backbone of accountability in any legal matter. They capture the truth of what occurred in court and are vital for ensuring fairness, especially in appeals and recusal applications,"" the parent said.

""In my case, being denied access to both the transcripts and the audio recordings took away my ability as a self-represented litigant, to present my case effectively or fairly.

""It denied me the ability to properly challenge judicial conduct. The weight of that injustice is something I carry every day, with no avenue for recourse and no means to restore what was lost both legally, and for myself and my child.""

Calls for judicial commission to 'protect the courts' reputation'

In 2021, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended the establishment of a federal judicial commission as part of its report into ""Judicial Impartiality and the Law on Bias"".

The commission would be an independent body that could examine complaints about the court system and the judiciary, similar to what already exists in some states and territories.

The federal attorney general agreed in principle to setting up the commission, but so far no action has been taken. The attorney general's department told the ABC it ""remains under consideration"".

That's not good enough, according to Greens Senator David Shoebridge, who sits on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.

""It's been three years now since the ALRC made the recommendation. Three years on and we haven't even seen a consultation paper or a draft bill from the federal government. Pretty much every state and territory have a judicial commission,"" he said.

""At the end of the day a judicial commission is not only good for members of the public or lawyers who have complaints, it's good for judges too because matters get resolved, unmeritorious complaints get dealt with, and the courts are able to protect their reputation.""

Mr Whealy agreed.

""It's not just a matter for the courts. It's a matter for the community who are exposed to the processes of the courts and the administration of justice. Every member of the community wants to make sure that there are no miscarriages of justice occurring in the court system,"" he said.

The price of justice

A transcript for a single day of family court proceedings can set a parent back anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000 depending on the length of proceedings and deadline for turnaround.

The exorbitant cost has been a topic of contention for some time, with several government inquiries calling for change.

The Law Council of Australia highlighted the cost of transcripts as a barrier to justice in a 2018 report called the ""Justice Project"" — which included input from legal centres around the country.

""Exemption categories and court discretion to grant [fee] exemptions should also be reviewed and broadened in certain jurisdictions,"" the report stated.

In 2021, the ALRC's inquiry into ""Judicial Impartiality and the Law on Bias"" stated:

""Consideration should be given by courts to amendments to their rules and commercial arrangements that would enable greater — and more affordable — access to transcripts or recordings.""

The report also stated easier access to audio recordings should be considered, especially in cases where issues of bias had been raised.

Four years later, transcript fees are still ""absolutely ludicrous"", according to Hayder Shkara, the director of Justice Family Lawyers — a national network of 12 legal practices.

He said the cost of court transcripts was ""prohibitive"".

""It's a complete monopoly, which is also very concerning. Why is it dominated by one company? It's completely unfair,"" he said.

Mr Shkara said the court needed to catch up with advances in technology which would allow for ease and speed of transcription as well as verification.

""You would think with the improvements of technology, the workflows, streamlining different things, AI for goodness sake, all of these things have come out in the last 10 years and there has not been a decrease in costs,"" he said.

""These are everyday people [in court] who have low budgets.""

Mr Kelly agreed, saying the cost of transcripts was ""scandalous"".

""How can [the cost] be justified? It locks people out of their appeal rights.

""I have advised many people that they shouldn't proceed because they can't afford to pay for the transcripts. It makes consideration of an appeal very difficult. So people have to accept a decision that they believe is wrong.""

VIQ Solutions Australia Pty Ltd is a private subsidiary of VIQ Solutions, which is a public company based in Ontario. The parent company made a gross profit of $US19.2 million in 2024.

Mr Shoebridge said the optics of a foreign entity making profits from Australian family court proceedings was concerning.

""When you privatise essential public services like transcriptions in courts you create a lot of awkward incentives because obviously if this is a company that has a contract with the courts they don't want to get the courts offside.""

How are transcripts managed?

Transcripts are meant to be a true and correct record of court proceedings.

Any significant edits or changes to transcripts should occur with the knowledge and consent of all parties.

A spokesperson for the family court said: ""All equipment used to record hearings is owned and managed by VIQ Solutions, and no court staff member has access to the equipment, nor do staff members or judicial officers directly edit or alter transcripts"".

Upon further questioning, the spokesperson later clarified that ""court staff can correct typographical errors"" in transcripts.

However, in documents obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information (FOI) it was clear transcripts could be edited and altered at the discretion of judicial officers.

The court's ""Transcript Style Guide"" states ""a presiding judicial officer may direct that scandalous or otherwise objectionable remarks in a proceeding not be recorded in the transcript"".

The document also states that editing can occur to make the transcripts more ""readable"" including the removal of ""matters of no substance to the case"" as well as ""administrative"" matters.

Mr Kelly said it was important that judicial officers had the ability to edit transcripts, but it should be done in an open and transparent way.

""I recall times where a judge has said, 'look I'll have that removed from the transcript' if something scandalous has been said. And that should happen…but it's the controversial things where somebody is alleging something was or wasn't there or is slightly different.""

The documents released to the ABC under FOI also revealed that transcripts were sent to the court in an editable word format and that audio files were accessible by judges, registrars, judges associates and ""other authorised staff"".

Judges can retrieve and play back audio from the audio portal of any recorded proceeding from within 30 minutes of the dialogue being spoken.

The court can also request VIQ Solutions staff ""reproduce a transcript that does not accurately reflect the underlying recording"".

The contract between VIQ Solutions and the court states that VIQ must provide access to their premises, records and information and that the court can copy relevant documentation.

All ownership of the recordings and the transcripts are held by the court ""from the date of creation"", according to the contract.

Each month VIQ must provide the court with a quality report detailing any complaints made about the transcription service or audio recordings, the number of errors in transcripts and any instances where a non-authorised person has listened to a recording, according to the Statement of Requirements.

However, a court spokesperson told the ABC they could not provide any data about complaints associated with transcripts.

Documents released under FOI revealed the court set a target of no more than one error per 100 words and it conducted performance tracking on individual transcribers.

What about other jurisdictions?

In 2022, the Court of Appeal found a trial judge in a matter in the ACT Supreme Court unilaterally edited a transcript without the knowledge of the parties.

Loading...

The court found the judge had, ""listened to the audio recording … for the purpose of revising the trial transcript … without first inviting the parties' submissions not only as to the revision, but as to the consequences of the revision"".

The appeal on the basis of apprehended bias was successful, but the judgment made no mention of consequences for the judge's actions.

The ACT courts use a company called EPIQ Transcription Services to produce documents in that jurisdiction.

In May, a Federal Court judge raised concerns about the quality of transcripts in a matter between Ergon Energy Queensland and the Australian Energy Regulator.

Justice Cameron Moore stated:

""the preparation of this judgment has been hampered by the extremely poor quality of the transcript of the proceedings, which has not managed to record in any accurate way the exchanges in the course of oral submissions that elucidated the parties' positions on construction.""

The Federal Court also uses VIQ Solutions. The Federal Court did not answer the ABC's questions about how the transcript had become corrupted but a spokesperson said the court was working with VIQ Solutions to address ""inefficiencies"".

""On this occasion, the transcript was not of an acceptable quality. We take all issues relating to transcript quality and delivery seriously,"" a spokesperson said.

The ABC put detailed questions to VIQ Solutions about how the transcription service operated, what processes were in place to address errors and who had access to audio files and transcripts.

VIQ Solutions declined to comment.

The attorney general's department said any issues were a matter for the courts.

""The federal courts are each responsible for their own operation and management, and for making rules of court. This includes responsibility for transcription services and associated contractual arrangements,"" a spokesperson said.

Mr Whealy said it was the attorney general's responsibility to address any concerns regarding the legal system.

""The attorney general, as the first law officer, has the obligation to face up to problems that are there and to help solve them with the cooperation of the courts,"" he said.

""There's been a call for many years now for there to be a federal judicial commission. We don't have one and it defies description or any rational explanation as to why that should be so.""

Courts have given more leeway in determining who gets legal status in the country in the first place, but tend to be more strict on stripping that status away.","Federal immigration officials are reexamining green cards issued to people from 19 countries considered “high-risk” at President Donald Trump’s direction.

The decision, announced Nov. 27 by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, comes in light of the deadly shooting of two National Guard members by a suspected gunman who is an Afghan national.

“At the direction of @POTUS, I have directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,” USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said on X.

USCIS said it issued new guidance for “negative, country specific factors” to be considered when vetting people from 19 countries.

In other words, the government could try to remove legal status of people with green cards from those countries for reasons related to their country of origin rather than anything they personally have done.

Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, said the agency guidance appears ambiguous on how it will make those determinations other than that USCIS officials is getting more discretion.

While details are forthcoming, and legal challenges are likely, here’s what to know on the guidance.

Which countries are included?

The new guidance applies to immigrants from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

These countries were previously listed in Trump’s June 4 proclamation seeking to restrict entry of people from them.

The Trump administration had previously halted Afghan refugee settlement and travel on the president’s first day in office, according to Tricia McLaughlin, secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security. The new USCIS announcement referred to “the status of those *previously* brought into the U.S.,” she said in an X post, meaning those already here would face additional scrutiny.

When does the policy go into effect?

USCIS’ Policy Alert says it took effect immediately.

How is the Trump administration conducting this review?

The changes appear to now take a harder look at people's origin countries to justify removal from the United States.

Trump’s past proclamation, cited by the USCIS guidance, included considering activities of terrorist groups, rates of nationalities overstaying their visas in the United States, and whether a country can issue secure identity documents.

Who’s affected?

Anyone from the affected countries who’s applying for permanent residency and anyone with existing green cards from the 19 nations.

The USCIS Policy Alert says it will consider ""relevant country-specific facts and circumstances."" It applies to people applying for certain adjustments of status, like for a green card, as well as extending stays or changing status for nonimmigrants, which is typically people in the country on a temporary basis.

What are the possible outcomes?

Officials could try to remove someone from the country.

USCIS says the change will allow its officers to better determine whether a person is a “threat to public safety and national security.”

But, Selee said, it would be difficult for the government to remove people with permanent residency status unless officials can prove to an immigration judge that they pose a national security threat. The administration has tried to remove pro-Palestinian student activists on those grounds, resulting in legal fights.

Courts have given more leeway in determining who gets legal status in the country in the first place, but tend to be more strict on stripping that status away.

This may signal that people looking at permanent residency in the future may be more affected than those already with green cards.

Is it going to face legal challenges?

Almost certainly.

USCIS based its policy on a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives the president powers to suspend or restrict the entry of ""all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants"" into the United States by proclamation if their entry would be detrimental to national interests.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/28/USAT/87510117007-usatgraphics-greencards.png?crop=6498,3655,x830,y433&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-29 01:56:27.612370

“Congress has just simply done nothing about immigration for years,” Skerry said.
“One of the problems with foreseeing the legal outcomes of these initiatives, should they come to pass, is the United States has two almost opposed legal doctrines that govern immigration,” Skrentny said.
“There will be negative impacts if we curtail immigration,” Skerry said.
So, it’s a difficult world we live in where people have different sets of facts.”","In a pair of lengthy social media posts, President Donald Trump said he’ll pause migration from “third world countries” and strip citizenship from migrants who “undermine domestic tranquility.” The president’s comments come in response to the deadly shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. by an Afghan national who was granted asylum.

Trump’s statements

The president wrote at length in the two posts about immigration in the U.S.

“This refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.),” Trump wrote. “As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.”

There is no evidence Somalians are overtaking Minnesota despite the president’s claims.

Trump’s response came after it was revealed the shooter in Washington is an Afghan national and refugee.

“One can appreciate the kind of shock and concerns that Americans have, witnessing something like that on the day before Thanksgiving, and the president responding to it,” Peter Skerry, professor of political science at Boston College, told Straight Arrow News. “As is his habit, he tends to overdramatize and make the argument too strong and in much too broad in general terms.”

Curbing immigration

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization,” Trump wrote.

When it comes to those statements as actual policy, there are several variables.

“They’re very vague, and it’s hard to see exactly how they would translate into national policy,” John Skrentny, sociology professor at University of California, San Diego, told SAN. “So trying to assess the legality of these moves is not the easiest thing in the world, because terms such as third world, that’s not a legal term, and it’s hard to know who’s in and who’s out of that.”

It’s not the first time Trump has used broad terms to describe foreign nations negatively including famously questioning why America would allow immigrants from “s—hole countries” during his first term.

“The American people have lots of reasons to be concerned and anxious about our immigration policies, but he pushes it to the limit, and I think that’s not very helpful,” Skerry said.

The Department of Homeland Security said they have indefinitely suspended processing immigration requests from Afghan nationals and plan to review all pending asylum cases approved under the Biden administration.

“Effective immediately, I am issuing new policy guidance that authorizes USCIS officers to consider country-specific factors as significant negative factors when reviewing immigration requests,” Joseph Edlow, USCIS director, said in a statement.

The ongoing influx of immigrants to the U.S. remains a concern for many Americans.

“Congress has just simply done nothing about immigration for years,” Skerry said. “I think that’s the relevant point here. Congress has to step up to the plate.”

Legality

Putting a halt on immigration from numerous countries would be a difficult task and would likely be challenged by members of Congress and the court system.

It could be similar to Trump’s so-called “Muslim ban” in 2017, which ended in a Supreme Court decision that allowed the ban to go through.

“One of the problems with foreseeing the legal outcomes of these initiatives, should they come to pass, is the United States has two almost opposed legal doctrines that govern immigration,” Skrentny said. “One of them is called the plenary power, and that’s the idea that in the case of immigration, the executive branch and Congress can pretty much do what they want.”

The other legal doctrine Skrentny pointed to is the 14th Amendment, which guarantees people, not just citizens, the due process of law.

“Having said that the law is whatever the judges say it is,” Skrentny said. “So, a lot of folks thought that Roe v. Wade was settled law. Turns out that it wasn’t.”

The Trump administration has taken unprecedented actions on immigration, such as invoking the Alien Enemies Act earlier this year.

“One would have to be concerned that they do it in a way that follows the law and does it in a systematic and fair way,” Skerry said. “The way they’ve been going, I have real doubts about that.”

The Trump administration has not always abided by laws or court rulings.

“Judges are just people sitting behind [a desk] and they’re just making pronouncements,” Skrentny said. “They don’t have an army, they don’t have a security force, they can’t enforce their opinions. And so, I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t think anyone who will tell you that they know what’s going to happen is being honest. Really, we’re in uncharted territory.”

Meanwhile, revoking people’s green cards is a possibility.

“It’s clear that green cards are revocable, have been revoked in specific instances, and they can and will do that,” Skerry said. “The question is, will they do it fairly following procedures, or do it in the kind of slipshod way that they seem to be doing most things when it comes to immigration policies.”

Stripping a person of citizenship is a much different process and can be very complex.

Impact of immigration change

The president’s immigration policies have had several implications on the country, including a reduction in the workforce, GDP loss and some have even pointed to added cost of living.

“There will be negative impacts if we curtail immigration,” Skerry said. “There already are negative impacts. The president himself has acknowledged that at various points.”

Immigration is a topic that continues to divide Americans at a time where many Americans believe the country is more divided than ever.

“If everyone was getting their news from Straight Arrow News, then maybe we wouldn’t have that problem,” Skrentny said. “But that’s not the case at this time. So, it’s a difficult world we live in where people have different sets of facts.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247918723_Pete_MarovichGetty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 00:56:21.911167

Looking ahead, she intends to continue exploring migration, visiting shelters she has yet to know, documenting spaces with distinct challenges and dynamics.","“I am not interested in exposing, but in accompanying. For me, trust is invaluable,” Olivia Vivanco.

Olivia Vivanco was born and still lives in Mexico City, but the path that led her to photograph migration, she likes to say, “arrived almost by coincidence.” In the late 1990s, while working on projects about childhood, she began visiting schools attended by the children of migrant farmworkers—families from Guerrero, Oaxaca, or Chiapas who traveled north to Nayarit or Sinaloa following the agricultural seasons. She remembers her surprise at seeing entire families working side by side: “Parents, children, siblings—all part of the same labor force.”

The topic reappeared years later, around 2012, when Central American migration dominated public attention—La Bestia, kidnappings, assaults, and the San Fernando massacre. A friend from the Jesuit Migrant Service encouraged her to volunteer at shelters, and that is how she arrived at La 72 in Tenosique, Tabasco.

“At first, I didn’t go as a photographer, but as a volunteer. But being there I realized that this space—which hardly appeared in migration narratives—was also part of the story. Until then, I had seen many images of train tracks, accidents, pain, but in the shelters I found something different: an everyday life where bonds are built, where you can chat while washing dishes or sweeping the patio. I realized that things also happened there, but from a more intimate, more human place.”

Photography entered her life early. At seventeen she tagged along with a friend to a class and was the one who stayed. A cousin later gave her an enlarger and lab equipment, and she taught herself black-and-white photography. Though she abandoned it for a time, the desire for personal, thematic projects never left. When she returned to photography, she began again from scratch—this time with purpose. She cites Lewis Hine for his ability to expose child labor and provoke real social change. But a decisive encounter was with photographer and curator Javier Ramírez Limón, who helped her understand that “formal decisions had to be at the service of the subject, not at the service of a personal style.”

Migration remained her central subject because it never stopped changing. “No year is like the previous one,” she explains. The south differs from the north; a first crossing differs from a second or a tenth. In the south she saw people already harmed by their first contact with Mexico; in the north she met travelers who had endured months of uncertainty, violence, and fear. Over time she came to realize that photography alone could not capture the entire story.

“That constant transformation has kept me interested in the topic and has also transformed my way of narrating: There were moments when I understood that photography could not contain everything, especially what is not seen —the disappearances, the waiting, the uncertainty. That’s when I started incorporating video, interviews, objects, and records of empty spaces. I am interested in speaking about migration through its silences and its material traces.”

Her encounters with migrants map out the shifts in global movement. In the early years most came from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. There were occasional Nicaraguans, Cubans, or Africans. But today the landscape is vast: Venezuelans, Colombians, Ecuadorians, Haitians—many of whom lived for years in Brazil or Chile before moving north. She recalls meeting Haitian workers who built stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and later found themselves stranded in Tijuana. In recent years she has met Ukrainians and Russians fleeing war or conscription. “Every year, nationalities become more diverse and the stories more complex.”

People share with her a wide range of reasons for leaving. “From domestic or gender violence to extortion, protection rackets, loss of property, or generalized impoverishment. There are also those who flee due to disagreement with their governments or simply because they cannot find conditions for a dignified life. There are very painful stories of people crossing the Darién and losing companions along the way; women who are assaulted; children who carry memories of scenes no child should witness. But deep down, all of these stories share the search for a better life. Yes, for economic prosperity, but mainly for peace.”

Some stories, though, remain particularly painful. “In Mexicali I met several elderly Mexican men who had been deported. They had spent most of their lives in the United States. They migrated when they were young, formed families there, had children and grandchildren, and suddenly, for a minimal infraction —sometimes a traffic violation— they were sent back to a country they no longer recognized as their own. Here they have no family ties, no access to work or social security. Age leaves them out of the labor market, and a technological gap even separates them from their loved ones.”

As Olivia explains, these are men aging in a territory that feels foreign, without support networks, without a clear future. “Many fall into depression or illness, without access to medical care. It is a silent form of uprooting. Their stories hurt me deeply because they are rarely told, but they are also migration: stories of forced return and loss of belonging.”

One of her most emotional photographs came from her series Reliquias, made at La 72. She was drawn to the tiny backpacks migrants carry, curious about the objects important enough to accompany someone across continents. She asked migrants to show her something they considered a personal treasure. Fredy, from Honduras, wanted to show her a photograph of his daughter, but discovered he had lost it. Heartbroken, he surprised her by asking to proceed anyway. “He told me to write his daughter’s name—Astrid—on his hand,” she remembers. “Even though he no longer had the image, she was still with him.”

Olivia works primarily in shelters across Mexico—Tecún Umán, Tapachula, Tenosique, Ixtepec, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Mexico City, Tijuana, Mexicali, Altar, Ciudad Juárez, Saltillo, Piedras Negras, Nuevo Laredo. “I do not accompany migrants on their routes,” she explains. “My work happens in shelters, where they stop for hours or days and it’s possible to build bonds of trust. There, we coexist, share tasks, converse. From these spaces I have also developed a project parallel to photography: Collecting objects migrants leave behind on the road. I do this together with migrants who, based on their own experience, help validate that these objects belonged to other travelers. It is a different way of narrating transit, through the material traces left behind.”

In recent years I have also worked in improvised camps in Mexico City. Faced with the lack of shelter capacity, many people —especially Venezuelan or Haitian families— have been forced to remain on the street, in very precarious conditions, without access to basic services or safety. These places have also become part of the current migratory landscape.

“Unfortunately, many of the areas migrants travel through are also territories controlled by organized crime or networks linked to drug trafficking. In the north of the country I have had a couple of difficult experiences; situations of threat and surveillance that at one point made me reconsider the topic,” she explains.

But in those contexts, Olivia’s priority has always been collective safety. “I adhere to the recommendations of shelter coordinators, not only for my own protection but above all to avoid putting migrants at risk. Many are already fleeing violence or direct threats; the last thing I can allow is for my presence or work to worsen their vulnerability.”

Rather than learning to prepare for danger, Olivia has learned to recognize limits. “I know when it’s time to leave, and to trust those who know the terrain. Prudence and respect, I believe, are the best forms of care.”

Ethics guide everything she does.

“In my work in migrant houses, I decided years ago to avoid photographing people. This choice came from my disagreement with how the media often portrayed migrants: extremely close-up, in moments of exhaustion, hunger, or sadness. It made me uncomfortable how those representations could revictimize or even criminalize them. I thought that, if I were in such a situation —far from my country, in transit, without access to basic necessities— I wouldn’t want to be portrayed that way. That’s why I chose to speak about migration through spaces: shelters, objects, the material traces people leave as they pass. In those traces their presence is there, in a respectful way, showing without exposing.”

When conducting interviews or more personal conversations, Olivia always introduces herself and clearly explains what she is doing and why. “I ask if they want to share their name or prefer to remain anonymous, and I absolutely respect their decision. I am not interested in exposing, but in accompanying. For me, their trust is invaluable.”

Olivia is interested in making visible the spaces where migration happens “beyond the route or the train, and also other moments of migrants’ lives.” She believes documentary photography remains necessary precisely because it does something that artificial intelligence or media discourse cannot: “be present, listen, observe, and transform that experience into a visual testimony.”

Defining her work ethic, she says, “My responsibility is not to put people at risk, but rather to protect their identity, and to ensure they maintain agency within the narrative.” Olivia thinks of photography as an act of co-creation. “It is a process in which my work does not stand on its own without the collaboration of the other.”

In the case of migration, Olivia is interested in reaching as many people as possible, “broad audiences, not only specialized ones.” Her images and projects have been shared in academic spaces, civil society media and exhibitions, “but something I value especially is when the work sparks conversations, generates questions or produces shared knowledge.” As she explains, “Photography alone doesn’t tell everything; that’s why I think it’s important to also speak, to convey what migrants share with me during my stays, their vulnerabilities and their resilience.”

Oliva hopes that her images serve as a starting point for reflection about human rights, the needs of people in transit, the absence of governmental attention or institutional abandonment in the search for missing migrants. “My work is only the tip of the thread: behind every image there is a complex weave of stories, violence, resistance and hope that is not seen by those far from the topic.” Projects like MigraPalabra, a zine created with Pablo Landa and Mi Valedor, expand this purpose by centering migrants’ own voices and creativity.

“In places like Mexico City, where there are strong prejudices toward migrant camps, it is evident how media discourse often stays at the surface. There is talk of overcrowding or dirt, but rarely is it mentioned that the lack of basic services —water, toilets, minimum care— is the responsibility of the State, not of those forced to live in those conditions. I want my work to open those conversations, to allow migration to be seen from its complexity and not from misinformation or fear.”

Her projects have received a generous international reception. Reliquias has traveled across the Americas, Europe, and Africa, published widely, and awarded in Colombia and Mexico. Her work in shelters, part of the De Paso project, has appeared in Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and is included in the XV IBERO Puebla Biennial of Contemporary Art 2025. Her exhibition Pausas en el Camino at the Sonora Museum of Art has resonated deeply, especially with young viewers who value seeing migration “from another perspective—places where sometimes nothing happens, or through objects that speak of everyday transit without showing people.”

She is now reviewing twelve years of work, planning a publication where her photographs dialogue with voices from architecture, literature, human rights, and shelter coordinators. She envisions a broader conversation in which images are just one thread. She is also preparing a traveling exhibition to reach new audiences.

Looking ahead, she intends to continue exploring migration, visiting shelters she has yet to know, documenting spaces with distinct challenges and dynamics. “I deeply respect all the migrants I have met; men, women, children who have left their country, their home, their family, and who have traveled dangerous routes and endured extremely harsh experiences with the hope of a better life. That decision —to leave, to try despite everything— is in itself worthy of respect.”

Olivia is also grateful for the volunteers, religious women and men, human rights defenders, “people who have made this work their way of life,” she says. “Many of them not only care for people in the shelters; they also remain attentive to their journeys, even when the people are already in other countries.”

Working in shelters has taught her valuable lessons, including the value of presence and accompaniment. “Every shelter, every migrant house, has its own dynamics and rhythms, very delicate stories and being received there is an act of generosity.” Volunteer work is very fulfilling, she says. “I believe what people most appreciate is daily accompaniment. And although I do not have professional training for emotional support, I can listen and offer time. I have learned not to impose my needs on theirs, to adapt myself, and to be there only as far as I am allowed.”

As for what transit countries must do, she is clear. “I believe they must assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the safety and free transit of migrants. They should not be harassed, assaulted or exploited. Unfortunately, in Mexico violence affects the entire population, but in the case of migrants it is often doubled, from organized crime and, many times, also from authorities. Those who should protect them —immigration institutions, police, security forces— too often become those who extort, threaten or abuse.”

As Olivia remarks, “countries have the obligation to protect all people on their territory, even temporarily. It’s not only about allowing them to pass, but ensuring that passage is safe, dignified, without violence, and with full respect for human rights. Migrants should be treated like any citizen in terms of basic rights: access to services, protection, emergency attention. Essentially, it’s about recognizing their humanity.”

Ultimately, Olivia Vivanco’s work is a sustained act of witnessing—one that listens to what migration leaves unsaid and shines light on the resilient lives crossing Mexico in search of peace.

Experts say many are already in place,Not Available,,,,,https://www.wral.com/story/trump-pushes-for-more-restrictions-on-afghan-refugees-experts-say-many-are-already-in-place/22265944/,"And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.
The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome.
Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump.
However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.
He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society.","The Trump administration is promising an even tougher anti-immigration agenda after an Afghan national was being charged in the shooting this week of two National Guard members, with new restrictions targeting the tens of thousands of Afghans resettled in the U.S. and those seeking to come, many of whom served alongside American soldiers in the two-decade war.

But those still waiting to come were already facing stricter measures as part of President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on legal and illegal migration that began when he started his second term in January. And the Afghan immigrants living in the U.S. and now in the administration’s crosshairs were among the most extensively vetted, often undergoing years of security screening, experts and advocates say.

The suspected shooter, who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, “was vetted both before he landed, probably once he landed, once he applied for asylum,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute. “But more importantly, he was almost certainly vetted extensively and much more by the CIA.”

Haris Tarin, a former U.S. official who worked on the Biden-era program that resettled Afghans, predicted that ""as the investigation unfolds, you will see that this is not a failure of screening. This is a failure of us not being able to integrate — not just foreign intelligence and military personnel — but our own veterans, over the past 25 years.”

The program Operations Allies Welcome initially brought roughly 76,000 Afghans to the United States, many of whom had worked alongside American troops and diplomats as interpreters and translators. The initiative was in place for around one year before shifting to a longer-term program called Operation Enduring Welcome. Almost 200,000 Afghans have been resettled in the U.S. under both programs.

Among those brought to the U.S. under the program was the alleged shooter, 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who now faces a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old Specialist Sarah Beckstrom. The other National Guard member who was shot, 24-year-old Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, remains in critical condition.

Those resettlements are now on hold. The State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X.

Trump and his allies have seized on the shooting to criticize gaps in the U.S. vetting process and the speed of admissions, even though some Republicans spent the months and years after the 2021 withdrawal criticizing the Biden administration for not moving fast enough to approve some applications from Afghan allies.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Lakanwal “should have never been allowed to come here,” Trump called lax migration policies “the single greatest national security threat facing our nation,” and Vice President JD Vance said Biden’s policy was “opening the floodgate to unvetted Afghan refugees.”

That rhetoric quickly turned into policy announcements, with Trump saying he would ""permanently pause all migration” from a list of nearly 20 countries, “terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,” and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.” Many of these changes had already been set in motion through a series of executive orders over the past 10 months, including most recently in June.

“They are highlighting practices that were already going into place,” said Andrea Flores, a lawyer who was an immigration policy adviser in the Obama and Biden administrations.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, and his request was approved in April of this year after undergoing a thorough vetting, according to #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the war.

Flores said the system has worked across administrations: “You may hear people say, ‘Well, he was granted asylum under Trump. This is Trump’s problem.’ That’s not how our immigration system works. It relies on the same bedding. No asylum laws have really been changed by Congress.”

Trump and other U.S. officials have used the attack to demand a re-examination for everyone who came to the U.S. from Afghanistan, a country he called “a hellhole on Earth” on Thursday.

“These policies were already creating widespread disruption and fear among lawfully admitted families. What’s new and deeply troubling is the attempt to retroactively tie all of this to one act of violence in a way that casts suspicion on entire nationalities, including Afghan allies who risked their lives to protect our troops,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, said in a statement Friday.

This has left the nearly 200,000 Afghans who are currently living across the U.S. in deep fear and shame over the actions of one person in their community. Those in the U.S. are now worrying about their legal status being revoked, while others in the immigration pipeline here and abroad are waiting in limbo.

Nesar, a 22-year-old Afghan who arrived in America weeks after the fall of Kabul, said he had just begun to assimilate into life in the U.S. when the attack happened on Wednesday. He agreed to speak to The Associated Press on condition that only his first name be used for fear of reprisals or targeting by immigration officials.

“Life was finally getting easier for me. I’ve learned to speak English. I found a better job,” he said. “But after this happened two days ago, I honestly went to the grocery store this morning, and I was feeling so uncomfortable among all of those people. I was like, maybe they’re now looking at me the same way as the shooter.”

Two days before the shooting, Nesar and his father, who worked for the Afghan president during the war, had received an interview date of Dec. 13 for their green card application, a moment he said they had been working toward for four years. However, he says it is now unclear if their application will move forward or if their interview will take place.

Another Afghan national, who also spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, said that after fearing for his life under Taliban rule, he felt a sense of peace and hope when he finally received a special immigrant visa to come to the U.S. two years ago.

He said he thought he could use his experience working as a defense attorney in Afghanistan to contribute to American society. But now, he says the actions of an “extremist who, despite benefiting from the safety and livelihood provided by this country, ungratefully attacked two American soldiers,” he and other Afghans will once again face scrutiny.

“It seems that whenever a terrorist commits a crime, its shadow falls upon me simply because I am from Afghanistan,” he added.

VANESSA ROMO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.
She was an Army specialist with the National Guard, and she joined the service just a couple of years ago in 2023.
She was just 20 years old and was from Summersville, West Virginia.
What is the Trump administration saying and doing in response?","SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

West Virginia held a moment of silence this afternoon for the National Guard members who were shot in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. One of the two has died. A second remains in critical condition. And here to give us the latest on the shooting and the investigation is NPR's Vanessa Romo. Hi, Vanessa.

VANESSA ROMO, BYLINE: Hi, Scott.

DETROW: What do we know about the Guard member who died yesterday?

ROMO: Her name is Sarah Beckstrom. She was an Army specialist with the National Guard, and she joined the service just a couple of years ago in 2023. She was just 20 years old and was from Summersville, West Virginia. Obviously, her family is devastated by the tragedy. And in a post on Facebook, Beckstrom's father called her his baby girl and said that she had passed to glory.

Also, West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey said in a statement earlier today that Beckstrom had made, quote, ""the ultimate sacrifice in service to her state and the nation."" He added that both Beckstrom and Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, the second victim who remains in critical condition, had actually stepped forward and volunteered for the mission in D.C.

DETROW: What is the latest on the investigation? What do we know about the suspect at this point?

ROMO: His name is Rahmanullah Lakanwal, and he's an Afghan national. And he's himself hospitalized after the shooting. He is 29 years old, and he was just 5 when the war in Afghanistan started. He immigrated to the U.S. in 2021, when the U.S. withdrew from the country and the Taliban toppled the government there.

According to a nonprofit that works with Afghan refugees, Lakanwal actually served in an elite counterterrorism unit that was called Zero Unit that was operated by the CIA. And Human Rights Watch reports that these specialized units, which were recruited and trained by the CIA, were used to carry out extremely violent clandestine missions. And CIA director John Ratcliffe confirmed that it's because of the work that Lakanwal did fighting against the Taliban for the U.S. that he and his family were allowed to flee here.

And U.S. officials say he's been living with his wife and children in Bellingham, Washington. After about four years, he was granted asylum just this past April. And as far as the investigation goes, that is ongoing. Officials are looking for leads in the U.S. and abroad. And at the moment, there's no clear motive in terms of what prompted him to drive nearly 3,000 miles across the country and launch the ambush.

DETROW: And this attack is playing out in our politics already. What is the Trump administration saying and doing in response?

ROMO: So the administration has already halted the processing of any immigration request from Afghan nationals. Plus, the head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joe Edlow, announced a, quote, ""full scale, rigorous reexamination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern."" In a statement, USCIS referred to 19 different countries that the administration already declared required extra vetting. A proclamation earlier this year restricted travel from immigrants and nonimmigrants to the U.S.

And we should also note that the Trump administration halted refugee resettlement from Afghanistan on the very first day of his second term. And late last night, Trump wrote on Truth Social that, quote, ""refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America."" And then he went on to blame immigrants for crime and using federal benefits. And he called out legal green card holders for getting support. Trump also said that he's going to, quote, ""permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover."" But it's not clear if this goes further than what has already been announced, or if additional policy changes are coming.

DETROW: That is NPR's Vanessa Romo. Thank you so much for the latest.

The case was assigned to U.S. district court Judge Paula Xinis, and on April 4, she issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.

As I explained above, statutory withholding is country specific, but no minute order appears in the record in his federal court case.","Politico reported last week from the ongoing hearings in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Md., on the government’s attempts to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member whose removal to El Salvador in the spring triggered a national firestorm. Apparently, 30 weeks later, the judge hearing the case realized something I reported on in early April – though the implications may not be quite what she thinks they are.

The Kilmar Abrego-Garcia Saga

This case became national news on April 1, the New York Times reported: “A Maryland man who was in the United States legally was deported to El Salvador and imprisoned there because of an ‘administrative error.’”

The “Maryland man” is Abrego, a Salvadoran national alleged by both local authorities and the federal government to be a member of MS-13.

He entered illegally in March 2012, and but was only taken into custody by ICE in March 2019, based both on his illegal status and purported evidence linking him to MS-13, a violent criminal organization with its roots in Los Angeles and a significant presence in El Salvador and elsewhere.

In April 2019, an immigration judge (IJ) in Baltimore denied Abrego’s bond request, finding the evidence in the case “shows that he is a verified member of MS-13”. He appealed that bond denial, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) adopted and affirmed what it referred to as the IJ’s “danger ruling” eight months later.

While in detained removal proceedings, Abrego through counsel filed an application for asylum, “statutory withholding” of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).

That application was assigned to a second IJ, who on October 10, 2019, granted Abrego’s statutory withholding application but denied his applications for asylum and CAT.

Abrego Garcia was released following that grant, but rearrested by ICE on March 12, 2025, and sent to an ICE detention facility in Texas.

Thereafter, he was removed to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) in El Salvador sometime around March 16 under an agreement (the terms of which are still undisclosed) the administration struck with the government of that country.

On March 24 – nine days after he arrived in El Salvador – Abrego, his wife, and child, through counsel, filed a “Complaint for Injunctive Relief and Declaratory Judgment” in federal district court in Maryland.

The case was assigned to U.S. district court Judge Paula Xinis, and on April 4, she issued an order granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. That order formed the basis of DOJ’s later appeal to the Fourth Circuit, and ultimately its application to the Supreme Court.

Specifically, Judge Xinis directed the government to “facilitate and effectuate the return of ... Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States by no later than 11:59 PM on Monday, April 7, 2025”.

By ordering the government to “effectuate” the return of Abrego Garcia, the judge was demanding the administration to engage in expedited diplomatic negotiations with El Salvador and requiring that those negotiations result in the return of Abrego Garcia – again, a Salvadoran citizen – to the United States before April 8.

The government asked the Fourth Circuit to stay Judge Xinis’s order, noting in its Emergency Motion: “The United States does not have control over Abrego Garcia. Or the sovereign nation of El Salvador.”

A three-judge circuit panel denied that motion on April 7, forcing DOJ to quickly file an application to vacate Judge Xinis’s order with Chief Justice John Roberts, the circuit justice for the Fourth Circuit.

The chief justice issued an administrative stay of the district court order to give the Court the chance to consider the government’s application, and on April 10, all nine justices weighed in.

The Court noted Judge Xinis’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador”.

Nonetheless, the justices remanded the case to Judge Xinis to “clarify” her demand that the government “effectuate” the alien’s return, “with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs”.

While Abrego was in El Salvador, on May 21, a grand jury in Tennessee handed down an indictment in U.S. v. Abrego Garcia, charging him with conspiracy to transport aliens under section 274(a)(1)(A)(v)(I) of the INA and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens” under section 274(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the INA.

That indictment was unsealed by order of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee on June 6, the same day Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Abrego had been returned to the United States to answer those charges.

Both the criminal case and the case before Judge Xinis remain pending.

Back to the Beginning

Remember, Abrego – through counsel – was the petitioner in the Maryland case, and as such bore the burden of showing that he had been improperly removed from the United States to El Salvador.

To establish that he had been improperly removed, Abrego submitted a 14-page decision issued by the second IJ to hear his case on October 10, 2019. That was the only proof of that fact he offered, but as I explained on April 4, having read that order it appeared the IJ had granted Abrego statutory withholding to Guatemala, not El Salvador.

Notably, in the “conclusion” paragraph in that decision, the second IJ explained:

DHS has not shown that there are changed circumstances in Guatemala that would result in the Respondent’s life not being threatened, or that internal relocation is possible and reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, the Respondent’s application for withholding under the Act is granted. [Emphasis added.]

Guatemala and El Salvador are two different countries, and while no transcript of the hearings before Judge Xinis appears in the record, I assume that the attorney representing DOJ admitted that Abrego was removed from the United States due to administrative error.

Lawyers owe a duty of candor to the court, and perhaps that lawyer knew some extrinsic facts that aren’t in the record. If, however, the DOJ lawyer relied on the October 10, 2019, decision from the second IJ, that admission may have been in error.

Statutory withholding is “country-specific”, in that it prevents the government from deporting an alien granted that protection to the country or countries from which the IJ or BIA withheld removal.

In fact, the regulation governing statutory withholding, 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16, states in its final subsection (f): “Nothing in this section . . . shall prevent [DHS] from removing an alien to a third country other than the country to which removal has been withheld or deferred.”

“An Immigration Court Error 6 Years Ago Could Lead to Release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia”

Which brings me to the Politico article, headlined “An immigration court error 6 years ago could lead to release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia”.

The article quotes Judge Xinis as stating in open court on November 20:

There is no order of removal in the docket, in the record . . .. You can’t fake it ‘til you make it. You got to have it. … You have to have the order. It’s got to be an order memorialized somewhere and I don’t have it.

The “order” Judge Xinis is apparently referring to is what’s commonly known as a “minute order”, a preprinted document the second IJ would have (or should have) issued when he issued his October 10, 2019, decision.

As I explained back on April 4:

While the judge’s memorandum of decision and order is enlightening, it conveys no legal authority in and of itself. At the time he issued it, the immigration judge should also have issued a separate preprinted form referred to as a “minute order”, which does have legal authority.

On that form, the immigration judge would have checked boxes showing he denied asylum and CAT, but granted statutory withholding, which Abrego Garcia would have needed to present to prove that he had lawful status in the United States.

That minute order, however, would also have shown that Abrego Garcia was ordered removed and listed the country to which removal was ordered but withheld. As I explained above, statutory withholding is country specific, but no minute order appears in the record in his federal court case.

Abrego was represented by counsel in his removal proceedings before the second IJ, and if the second IJ failed to issue a minute order it was up to that lawyer to ask the court to prepare and serve one.

This isn’t a mere “paperwork” issue: Abrego needed that document to prove he was here lawfully and to apply for work authorization. He had every reason to request one, and again that minute order – not the October 10, 2019, decision – was the proof Abrego needed when he filed his complaint with Judge Xinis in March to prove the government had unlawfully removed him to El Salvador.

Faking It Until Making It

Respectfully, everybody in this case has been faking it until they can make it in this case, or nobody is. And in my opinion, nobody is; they are just a little unclear on the law.

By precedent, an order of removal was a “condition precedent”, a crucial step the second IJ was required to take before he could grant Abrego statutory withholding.

The precedent in question is the BIA’s 2008 opinion in Matter of I-S- & C-S-, where the Board held: “When an Immigration Judge issues a decision granting an alien’s application for withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the [INA], without a grant of asylum, the decision must include an explicit order of removal.”

It’s possible the second IJ never issued a minute order in Abrego’s case (I had plenty of other issues with his decision), but I doubt it and if there is one, it’s in his alien file (A-file) and in the immigration court Record of Proceedings (ROP) -- and it will clarify whether withholding was granted to El Salvador or Guatemala.

Somebody may want to check out Abrego’s A-file and ROP, but considering that precedent and the second IJ’s decision, I’d argue that even absent a minute order, the second IJ de jure had to have ordered Abrego removed to grant him statutory withholding, and that he granted withholding to Guatemala.

But respectfully, Judge Xinis could have spared everyone a lot of drama and court time if she had simply asked Abrego – who again bore the initial burden of proof in the case – for the minute order in his case before she did anything else.

Not that I blame her for failing to do so. Section 242 of the INA governs judicial review in immigration cases, and Congress therein largely cut district courts out of the process. Cases like this are terra incognita for most trial-level federal court judges (which is why they may want to be circumspect when they do consider them).

In April, I noted two key defects in Abrego v. Noem: an IJ decision that appeared to withhold Abrego’s removal to Guatemala, not El Salvador; and the absence in the record of a minute order, a legal document that would clarify the issue.

I’m dumbfounded that only now – after this case was considered by 13 different federal judges (one district, three circuit, and nine justices) and thousands of gallons of ink were spilled examining every aspect of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s life – has Judge Xinis identified the same issues I did 30 weeks ago. But the ultimate result may not be what she thinks it is.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/kilmar-tattoos.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 20:56:48.520538

This commentary examines the Eleventh Circuit’s unpublished per curiam decision in Richard Rose v. Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, No. 25‑11233 (11th Cir. Nov. 25, 2025), a follow‑on appeal in a high‑profile Voting Rights Act challenge to Georgia’s method of electing members of its Public Service Commission (“PSC”).

Four Black Georgia voters – Richard Rose, Brionte McCorkle, Wanda Mosley, and James Major Woodall – originally sued the Georgia Secretary of State contending that the statewide, at‑large method of electing PSC commissioners unlawfully diluted Black voting strength in violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (“VRA”). After extensive litigation and a bench trial, the district court ruled in their favor and enjoined the statewide system. The Secretary appealed, and in 2023 the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the plaintiffs lacked a legally viable § 2 theory because they had not proposed a satisfactory remedial plan that met the first Gingles precondition.

Once the appellate mandate issued, the plaintiffs attempted to amend their complaint to introduce new remedial theories and thereby resurrect their § 2 claim. The district court refused to permit amendment and entered judgment for the Secretary. The plaintiffs appealed again, arguing they should be allowed to amend under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15(a), 59(e), or 60(b).

The 2025 decision analyzed here does not revisit the merits of the Voting Rights Act claim. Instead, it addresses a procedural but highly consequential question: when, if ever, may a plaintiff radically re‑plead a case – including new theories of remedy – after having fully litigated, lost on appeal, and received an adverse mandate? The Eleventh Circuit affirms the denial of leave to amend, emphasizing the district court’s broad discretion and focusing on the “undue prejudice” that a late‑stage amendment would inflict on the defendant.

Although marked “NOT FOR PUBLICATION” and therefore non‑precedential under Eleventh Circuit rules, the opinion is instructive. It reinforces several significant principles:

Leave to amend is not automatic, even under Rule 15(a)’s liberal standard.

District courts may deny post‑judgment amendments when they would cause substantial prejudice to defendants, especially after years of intensive litigation.

Plaintiffs are not entitled to a “second bite at the apple” by advancing new legal or remedial theories only after an appellate loss.

The Supreme Court’s decision in Pullman-Standard v. Swint does not require district courts to permit amendment in this posture.

II. Summary of the Opinion

A. Factual and Institutional Background

The Georgia PSC is a five‑member body that regulates public utilities. It is described as “quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial,” with responsibilities including:

Administering federal funds for pipeline safety,

Setting utility rates, and

Adjudicating rate disputes.

Each commissioner must reside in one of five PSC geographic districts, but commissioners are elected by a statewide, at‑large vote rather than by voters solely within their district.

The plaintiffs alleged that this system diluted Black voters’ influence statewide in violation of Section 2 of the VRA and proposed a single remedy: converting the PSC elections from statewide, at‑large elections to single‑member district elections (i.e., each district electing its own commissioner by district‑only voting).

B. The First Appeal: Failure of the § 2 Theory

In Rose v. Secretary, State of Georgia, 87 F.4th 469 (11th Cir. 2023), the Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court’s judgment for the plaintiffs. The panel held that:

A § 2 vote dilution claim is governed by the three Gingles preconditions from Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986).

The first Gingles precondition – that the minority group be sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a “reasonably configured district” – implies a requirement that plaintiffs “offer a satisfactory remedial plan,” citing Wright v. Sumter Cnty. Bd. of Elections & Registration, 979 F.3d 1282, 1302 (11th Cir. 2020).

The plaintiffs’ only proposed remedy was a “single, dramatic remedy—transforming a statewide voting system into a single-member districted plan,” which the court found unsatisfactory as a remedial plan under § 2.

Because the plaintiffs did not offer a legally viable remedial plan, they failed the first Gingles precondition, and thus their entire § 2 claim failed. There were no remaining, unaddressed claims or theories.

C. The Post‑Mandate Motion to Amend

The appellate mandate issued on July 18, 2024. That same day, the plaintiffs:

Requested leave in the district court to amend their complaint under Rule 15, and

Filed a proposed amended complaint challenging the same PSC election method but now offering “several new proposed remedies” that they argued would satisfy Gingles.

On July 22, the district court formally entered judgment for the Secretary by adopting the Eleventh Circuit’s mandate. The plaintiffs then filed a motion for relief from judgment under Rules 59 and 60(b), again seeking the ability to amend.

The district court rejected their effort, finding that:

The plaintiffs had unduly delayed seeking to amend,

Allowing amendment would unduly prejudice the Secretary, and

The proposed amendment would be futile.

D. Issues on Second Appeal

On the second appeal, the plaintiffs contended that they should be permitted to amend their complaint regardless of which rule governs:

Rule 15(a) (liberal amendment standard),

Rule 59(e) (altering or amending judgment), or

Rule 60(b) (relief from judgment).

The Secretary responded that the plaintiffs could not satisfy even Rule 15(a), the most lenient standard.

E. Holding

The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of leave to amend. Applying an abuse‑of‑discretion standard, the panel:

Assumed without deciding that Rule 15(a) applied (the most favorable framework for plaintiffs).

Held that under Rule 15(a) the district court acted within its discretion to deny leave based on undue prejudice to the Secretary.

Rejected the plaintiffs’ reliance on Pullman-Standard v. Swint as a basis to require further proceedings or leave to amend.

The court concluded that, after “years of litigation” culminating in a complete appellate rejection of their theory, the plaintiffs could not reconfigure their case by adding new remedial theories at that late stage. The decision underscores that the district court’s interest in finality and fairness to the defendant outweighed the plaintiffs’ desire to salvage their lawsuit.

III. Detailed Analysis

A. Procedural Posture and Why It Matters

This appeal sits at the intersection of voting rights and civil procedure. Critically, the case was not at an early or mid‑litigation stage. By the time the plaintiffs sought to amend:

The complaint had been on file since July 2020;

The parties had completed extensive fact and expert discovery;

Multiple dispositive motions (including summary judgment) had been litigated;

A five‑day bench trial had taken place, with testimony from three experts and all PSC commissioners;

The district court had issued a merits ruling and a permanent injunction;

The Eleventh Circuit had reversed, holding the plaintiffs’ theory legally deficient; and

The appellate mandate had issued, leaving only entry of final judgment in favor of the Secretary.

In this procedural posture, the plaintiffs’ attempt to amend was not a routine mid‑case refinement. It was an effort to fundamentally restructure the case after full litigation and an adverse appellate decision. That context drives the court’s emphasis on prejudice, finality, and the limits of liberal amendment policy.

B. Standards for Amending Pleadings After Judgment

1. Rule 15(a): Liberal Amendment, but Not an Absolute Right

Rule 15(a)(1) permits one amendment “as a matter of course” within 21 days after service of an answer or certain motions. That period had long since expired (by 2021). Thereafter, under Rule 15(a)(2):

“a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party’s written consent or the court’s leave. The court should freely give leave when justice so requires.”

However, as the Eleventh Circuit reiterated:

“Amending a complaint is not an automatic right.” – Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253, 1263 (11th Cir. 2008).

Citing Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962), the court again acknowledged well‑established grounds for denying leave:

Undue delay,

Undue prejudice to the opposing party,

Futility of amendment, among others.

The Eleventh Circuit has consistently treated these as legitimate bases for district courts to withhold leave to amend even where Rule 15(a)’s general policy favors liberal amendment.

2. Rules 59(e) and 60(b): Post‑Judgment Relief

Once final judgment is entered, many circuits—including the Eleventh—often require that the judgment be altered under Rule 59(e) or relieved under Rule 60(b) before an amendment can proceed. The opinion notes:

Motions under Rule 59(e) and 60(b) are also reviewed for abuse of discretion, citing Shuford v. Fidelity Nat’l Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 508 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir. 2007) and Arthur v. Thomas, 739 F.3d 611, 628 (11th Cir. 2014).

However, the panel intentionally sidesteps the thorny doctrinal question of which standard formally governs at this stage. Instead, it assumes arguendo that the plaintiffs get the benefit of the most generous standard – Rule 15(a) – and still lose because of undue prejudice.

This is an important methodological move: by assuming the most plaintiff‑friendly rule applies and affirming nonetheless, the court leaves untouched (and unresolved) any deeper tension between Rule 15 and post‑judgment standards. The opinion is therefore deliberately narrow but highly practical: even under the best possible procedural lens for plaintiffs, the district court’s denial stands.

C. Precedents Cited and Their Influence

1. Rose v. Secretary, State of Georgia, 87 F.4th 469 (11th Cir. 2023)

The 2023 Rose decision is central. It provides the legal backdrop that makes the plaintiffs’ attempted amendment so significant. In that earlier appeal, the Eleventh Circuit:

Held that plaintiffs bringing § 2 vote dilution claims must satisfy the three Gingles preconditions.

Emphasized that the first Gingles precondition now includes a requirement that plaintiffs “offer a satisfactory remedial plan.”

Concluded that the plaintiffs’ sole proposed remedy—overhauling the election system from statewide at‑large to district-based single‑member districts for the PSC—was not a “satisfactory remedial plan.”

Therefore held that the plaintiffs failed to establish a cognizable § 2 claim, and reversed the district court’s injunction.

The effect of the 2023 decision was not a narrow evidentiary correction; it was a complete rejection of the plaintiffs’ theory of liability under § 2 as they had chosen to plead and prove it.

2. Thornburg v. Gingles and Allen v. Milligan

The 2025 opinion reiterates the classical framework for § 2 vote dilution claims from Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30 (1986), and quotes Allen v. Milligan, 599 U.S. 1, 18 (2023), for the formulation of the first Gingles precondition:

“the minority group must be sufficiently large and [geographically] compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured district.”

The panel links this precondition to the need for a “satisfactory remedial plan,” relying on Wright v. Sumter Cnty. Bd. of Elections & Registration, 979 F.3d 1282, 1302 (11th Cir. 2020). Thus, even in this procedural appeal, the earlier substantive voting‑rights doctrine frames why the plaintiffs now want to amend: they are trying to fix the remedial defect illuminated by Rose (2023).

3. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178 (1962)

Foman is the foundational Supreme Court case on leave to amend under Rule 15. It held that leave should be “freely given” unless there is a legitimate reason to deny it, such as:

Undue delay,

Bad faith,

Repeated failure to cure deficiencies,

Undue prejudice, or

Futility.

The Eleventh Circuit invokes Foman as the doctrinal anchor for recognizing “undue prejudice” as a valid, independent ground for denying leave to amend.

4. Eleventh Circuit Amendment Cases: Reese and Maynard

The court relies heavily on its own precedents interpreting and applying Foman:

Reese v. Herbert, 527 F.3d 1253 (11th Cir. 2008), for the proposition that a district court may deny leave to amend based on undue delay, prejudice, or futility, and that courts have inherent power to manage litigation by doing so.

Maynard v. Board of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dep’t of Educ. ex rel. Univ. of S. Fla., 342 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 2003), where the court affirmed denial of leave to amend before trial because allowing amendment at the end of discovery would cause undue prejudice by forcing the defendant to re‑open discovery and incur additional costs.

By analogy, the panel reasons that if prejudice justified denial of amendment at the end of discovery but before trial in Maynard, then a fortiori prejudice justifies denial:

After full discovery,

After a full bench trial,

After an appeal and reversal, and

After issuance of the appellate mandate.

5. Abuse‑of‑Discretion Cases: Burger King, Shuford, Arthur

The panel cites:

Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d 1310, 1319 (11th Cir. 1999) for the general rule that denials of leave to amend are reviewed for abuse of discretion;

Shuford and Arthur for abuse‑of‑discretion review of Rule 59(e) and 60(b) motions, respectively.

These citations emphasize that the appellate court’s role is not to substitute its judgment de novo, but to ask only whether the district court’s decision was within a broad range of permissible choices. That deference substantially strengthens the case for affirmance here.

6. Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273 (1982)

The plaintiffs argued that Pullman-Standard required further proceedings – and implicitly, an opportunity to amend – because the original district court decision allegedly rested on an “erroneous view of the law.” They relied on the Supreme Court’s statement:

“When an appellate court discerns that a district court has failed to make a finding because of an erroneous view of the law, the usual rule is that there should be a remand for further proceedings to permit the trial court to make the missing findings.” (emphasis added).

The Eleventh Circuit rejects this argument on two grounds:

Pullman-Standard articulates a “usual rule,” not a mandatory command. It describes typical appellate practice when factual findings are missing due to legal error, not an ironclad obligation.

Pullman-Standard governs appellate procedure, not district‑court discretion on amendments. It instructs appellate courts on how to handle incomplete factual findings; it says nothing about whether a district court must permit amendment after judgment and appeal.

Thus, Pullman-Standard does not alter the district court’s discretion under Rule 15, nor does it create a right for plaintiffs to re‑plead their case after losing on appeal.

D. The Court’s Legal Reasoning in Detail

1. Undue Prejudice to the Secretary

The panel’s core holding is that allowing amendment at this stage would “severely prejudice the Secretary.” The opinion details several categories of prejudice:

Reopened Discovery – The district court would have to reopen discovery to allow plaintiffs to develop a record to support their “new allegations” and newly proposed remedial plans. This would compel:

New depositions,

New document production,

Likely retention of new experts on both sides.

Additional Motions Practice – The new theories would almost certainly generate:

Fresh motions to dismiss,

New summary judgment motions,

New evidentiary motions (motions in limine), and related briefing.

Potential Retrial – The parties might need to “spend considerable resources to retry the case,” because the operative legal and factual questions would significantly change with the new remedial theories.

The court also notes an additional complication: the plaintiffs’ proposed amended complaint alleges that Georgia’s “existing” method of electing PSC members violates the VRA. If the “existing” method has changed since the original 2020 filing, that would require litigating:

Whether the method has, in fact, changed,

Whether the three‑year‑old trial record remains current, and

Whether new, more timely evidence must be developed and presented.

All of this, the court concludes, constitutes “significant” prejudice to the Secretary and squarely justifies denial of leave under Foman and Maynard.

2. Judicial Economy vs. Prejudice

The plaintiffs argued that judicial economy favored allowing amendment in this existing case rather than forcing a separate, future lawsuit. The court responds in two ways:

Judicial economy is a general policy; prejudice is a concrete harm. The court holds that “general policy concern[s]” about efficiency “do not refute the specific prejudice that the Secretary would face,” which is a sufficient, standalone ground for denial.

Speculative future litigation is not a sound basis to override present prejudice. The panel notes:

The plaintiffs “do not specify who would bring this hypothetical new case.”

If the same plaintiffs brought a new suit, they would face substantial hurdles under the doctrine of claim preclusion (res judicata).

No specific alternative plaintiffs are identified who could bring a new case immune from preclusion concerns.

Thus, the court declines to prioritize hypothetical efficiency in possible future litigation over the concrete, immediate prejudice that amendment would cause the Secretary.

3. Inherent Power to Manage Litigation

Citing Reese, the court observes that a district court may use its “inherent power to manage the conduct of litigation” by denying leave to amend when the amendment would result in undue prejudice. This reinforces the idea that case management, finality, and fairness to both parties are legitimate institutional interests that can outweigh the liberal amendment policy of Rule 15.

4. No Entitlement to a Second Merits Round

A key theme of the opinion is that the plaintiffs had already fully litigated their chosen theory:

They selected a particular theory of liability and remedy under § 2.

They litigated that theory from complaint through trial and appeal.

The Eleventh Circuit definitively rejected that theory as legally non‑viable.

To then allow amendment to present new remedial plans – effectively a new theory of how § 2 could be violated and remedied – would give plaintiffs a “second bite at the apple” after the first bite failed. The court implicitly views this as inconsistent with basic principles of finality and fair notice to defendants about the case they must defend.

E. Impact and Implications

1. For Future Voting Rights Act Litigation

Even though non‑precedential, the decision has important practical implications for § 2 litigation in the Eleventh Circuit:

Front‑load remedial planning. Plaintiffs in VRA vote‑dilution cases must think carefully at the outset about the remedial plans they are prepared to propose. Waiting until after an adverse appellate ruling to introduce alternative remedies will likely be too late.

One shot at satisfying Gingles. Once a § 2 case has gone through trial and an appeal, plaintiffs should not expect to be able to cure a defective Gingles showing (especially the remedial aspect of the first precondition) by amending the complaint post‑mandate.

Strategic caution in choosing a single, “dramatic” remedy. If plaintiffs choose to pin their entire case on a single, sweeping remedy—as in the PSC case—failure of that remedy may end the litigation entirely, without a chance to pivot to more modest or alternative remedies later.

2. For Civil Procedure and Amendment Practice in General

More broadly, the case sends a clear message about amendment practice in complex federal litigation:

The later in the case, the stronger the showing plaintiffs must make. While Rule 15(a) speaks of “freely giv[ing]” leave, that liberality is tempered by heightened concerns about prejudice and finality when litigation is far advanced.

Post‑judgment amendments are exceptional, not routine. Especially after an appeal and mandate, attempts to amend will face serious skepticism unless the proposed changes are minor or the prejudice to defendants is negligible.

Defendants’ litigation investment is legally cognizable prejudice. The court explicitly treats the Secretary’s sunk costs—extensive discovery, expert work, a bench trial, and an appellate victory—as relevant and weighty when assessing “undue prejudice.”

3. For Litigation Against Statewide Bodies Like the PSC

The case underscores the special complexity of suing state‑wide regulatory bodies:

Remedies that wholly restructure statewide election systems for functionally statewide offices are likely to face intense scrutiny under the remedial component of Gingles.

Courts may be wary of “single, dramatic remedies” that essentially transform the political character of such bodies, particularly if alternative, less disruptive remedies are not seriously explored.

Although the 2025 opinion does not itself address the substantive merits of such remedies, it functionally channels future litigants toward more thoroughly developed remedial theories from the outset.

IV. Complex Concepts Simplified

A. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and Vote Dilution

Section 2 of the VRA prohibits any voting practice or procedure that “results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote on account of race or color. In vote‑dilution cases (as opposed to voter suppression), the claim is that the structure of an election system—such as at‑large voting—dilutes the voting power of a minority group.

In Thornburg v. Gingles, the Supreme Court established three “preconditions” a plaintiff generally must prove in a vote‑dilution case involving districting or at‑large systems:

The minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a reasonably configured single‑member district.

The minority group is politically cohesive (its members tend to vote together).

The white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the minority’s preferred candidate.

Failure to prove any one of these preconditions is usually fatal to a § 2 vote dilution claim.

B. The “Remedial Plan” Aspect of the First Gingles Precondition

The first Gingles precondition is not purely theoretical. Plaintiffs must do more than show that, “on paper,” a compact district could exist. In the Eleventh Circuit, they must also propose a concrete, “satisfactory remedial plan” – a specific, workable districting or election scheme that the court could realistically adopt.

In the original Rose appeal, the plaintiffs proposed only one remedy: converting the PSC system from a statewide, at‑large election for a statewide regulatory body into a series of local, single‑member district elections. The Eleventh Circuit found this remedy legally unsatisfactory, which meant the first Gingles precondition was not met, and the § 2 claim failed.

C. At‑Large vs. Single‑Member District Elections

At‑large elections: All voters in the jurisdiction (e.g., the entire state) vote for all seats. This can dilute minority votes if the minority is geographically concentrated but outvoted statewide.

Single‑member district elections: The jurisdiction is divided into districts; each district elects one representative. If lines are drawn fairly, a geographically concentrated minority group may be able to elect candidates of choice in some districts.

The plaintiffs sought to replace Georgia’s statewide PSC elections with district-based elections, arguing that this would allow Black voters concentrated in certain areas to elect their preferred candidates.

D. “Undue Delay,” “Undue Prejudice,” and “Futility”

Under Rule 15(a) and Foman v. Davis, courts may deny amendment if:

Undue delay – The plaintiff waits an excessively long time without a good reason to amend, especially if the information was available earlier.

Undue prejudice – The amendment would unfairly disadvantage the other side, usually by:

Requiring extensive new discovery,

Changing the theory of the case late in the process, or

Forcing duplication of costly litigation efforts.

Futility – Even if allowed, the amended complaint would still fail to state a claim or would be barred as a matter of law.

In this case, the district court found all three, but the Eleventh Circuit affirmed solely on the basis of undue prejudice, which by itself is sufficient.

E. “Per Curiam,” “Non‑Argument Calendar,” and “Not for Publication”

Per curiam – An opinion issued in the name of the court rather than a specific judge. Here, Judges Jill Pryor, Branch, and Brasher comprise the panel.

Non‑argument calendar – The case was decided without oral argument, based solely on the briefs and record.

Not for publication – Under Eleventh Circuit rules, the opinion is non‑precedential. It does not bind future panels, though it may be cited as persuasive authority.

F. Mandate and Claim Preclusion

After an appeal is decided, the court of appeals issues a mandate to the district court instructing it on the disposition (e.g., affirm, reverse, remand). Once the mandate issues, the district court must act in accordance with it; its room to diverge is very limited.

The panel also alludes to claim preclusion (res judicata), the doctrine that prevents parties from relitigating claims that were or could have been raised in a prior action that ended in a final judgment on the merits between the same parties. The court suggests that:

If the same plaintiffs filed a new case about the same PSC election method, they would likely face claim preclusion obstacles.

This undermines the plaintiffs’ argument that, for judicial economy, amendment should be allowed to avoid a separate lawsuit – because such a lawsuit might be barred altogether.

V. Conclusion: Key Takeaways and Broader Significance

The Eleventh Circuit’s 2025 decision in Rose v. Secretary of State of Georgia delivers a clear procedural message in the context of high‑stakes voting rights litigation:

Leave to amend is liberal, but not limitless. Plaintiffs do not have a guaranteed right to re‑plead their case after fully litigating and losing on appeal.

Undue prejudice to the defendant is a powerful brake on late‑stage amendments. Years of discovery, expert testimony, trial, and appellate work are not costs that can be casually imposed twice on a defendant, especially when plaintiffs seek to introduce new legal or remedial theories post‑mandate.

Remedial theories in § 2 cases must be developed and vetted early. The case underscores the risk of relying on a single, sweeping remedial proposal: if it fails, plaintiffs are unlikely to get a post‑judgment opportunity to develop alternatives.

Pullman-Standard does not open a back door to serial relitigation. The Supreme Court’s guidance on remand for missing factual findings due to legal error does not require district courts to grant leave to amend after judgment and appeal.

In the broader legal context, this decision strengthens the principle of finality in federal civil litigation and reinforces district courts’ authority to manage their dockets and protect defendants from repetitive, costly relitigation. While plaintiffs retain robust tools to refine and expand their claims earlier in the process, those tools become sharply limited once the case has gone to trial, on appeal, and back again with a clear directive that their original theory fails as a matter of law.

For litigants, particularly in complex civil rights and election cases, the lesson is straightforward: fully develop both your liability theory and your remedial options before the case reaches trial and appeal. The courts will not readily permit a second retooling of the case after the first has been conclusively resolved.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 17:57:16.768689

THE LATEST | President Trump says one of two National Guard members shot on Wednesday has died

The Trump administration has already suspended all immigration applications from Afghan nationals. On Friday, the State Department also immediately paused issuing visas to those traveling on Afghan passports.

""Afghans are terrified that they're going to be held accountable for this one deranged gunman's actions, and they don't know what to do. They know that it's not their fault. They know they didn't do this. They know that. That Afghans don't wish to cause Americans harm,"" Shawn VanDiver, founder and President of AfghanEvac, told Scripps News.

While Trump did not identify which specific countries would be targeted in his plan, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow said the agency has been ordered to take enhanced steps to screen migrants from ""high-risk"" countries.

The agency pointed to a June proclamation that listed countries from which the U.S. banned and restricted travel, including nations across Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean and parts of Asia.

Trump said on Truth Social an influx of refugees is the ""leading cause of social dysfunction in America"" and appeared to blame migrants for higher crime. However, this claim has been increasingly debunked by migration policy experts.

According to an annual review of criminology report, ""high concentrations of immigrants are not associated with increased levels of crime and delinquency across neighborhoods and cities in the United States.""

Sumith Gunasekera was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Nov. 12 in Detroit, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a press release.

Gunasekera is an assistant professor of marketing at Ferris State, in Big Rapids, Michigan, according to the university's website. He holds a bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Colombo in Sri Lanka and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Nevada.

""Ferris State University leaders on Tuesday became aware of accusations regarding professor Sumith Gunasekera,"" said Dave Murray, FSU associate vice president for Marketing and Communications Dave Murray said in a statement. ""He has been placed on administrative leave while the university gathers more information. This is a personnel issue and it would be inappropriate for the university to further discuss the matter.""

Federal authorities said Gunasekera entered the U.S. in February 1998, then went to Canada. In August 1998, he was arrested by police in Brampton, Ontario, and accused of making death threats.

Three days later he was arrested again in Canada on charges of invitation to sexual touching and sexual interference. DHS said Gunasekera admitted to officers that this case involved a minor. He was convicted in November 1998 and sentenced to one month behind bars and one year of probation.

He was also arrested in September 2003 by law enforcement in Las Vegas and accused of open and gross lewdness, DHS said. He was convicted in January 2004 of disorderly conduct.

“It's sickening that a sex offender was working as a professor on an American college campus and was given access to vulnerable students to potentially victimize them,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Thanks to the brave ICE law enforcement officers, this sicko is behind bars and no longer able to prey on Americans.""

Authorities said Gunasekera had been in the U.S. on a student visa. When he applied for a change of status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, authorities realized he had been convicted of crimes in Canada.

""Over the years Gunasekera repeatedly attempted to manipulate our immigration system between applications, denials, and appeals despite the convictions in Canada that made him ineligible for legal status in the United States,"" DHS said in the release.

Officials said he remains in ICE custody as he awaits immigration proceedings.

Speaking Kurdish is forbidden in Turkey, as is naming children with Kurdish names, according to Gurtovia and media reports.
“Justice works very differently in Turkey if you’re Kurdish,” Gurtovaia said.
A U.S. immigration judge did not find him to be a high-risk individual, and the couple was waiting for his next immigration court date in January, she said.
Those and other plans shattered after immigration agents detained Abak Tuesday, just a day before her naturalization ceremony.","UPTOWN – When Eva Gurtovaia walked into the hallway of the Dirksen Federal Building Wednesday afternoon, a few neighbors and a local alderman cheered and embraced her.

She had just become a U.S. citizen. With a soft smile and teary eyes, she hugged her newly met Uptown neighbors, thanking them for being there.

Ald. Angela Clay (46th) and staffer Eleana Molise gave her a colorful bouquet of flowers and a card. Neighbors greeted her with signs that read “Go, Eva! You’re so courageous” and “Yay, Eva.”

But the celebratory mood was clouded by the detention of her husband, Enes Abak. “Her soulmate, her everything,” was not there to celebrate the long-awaited date.

That is because on Tuesday, at least six immigration agents detained him at the couple’s home in the 4600 block of North Kenmore Street, said Eleana Molise, director of housing and community services for the 46th Ward.

Molise arrived at the block after neighbors and members of the local rapid response group reported the presence of four unmarked vehicles and agents wearing ICE vests early Tuesday.

According to a neighbor, Abak walked out of his house around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday carrying coffee and cigarettes when he was detained in what appeared to be a targeted operation, Molise said.

Abak, 29, is Kurdish, the largest and most discriminated-against minority group in Turkey, according to the Minority Rights Group. Since the 90s, hundreds of thousands of Kurdish people have been internally displaced or left the country to escape violence. The group estimates up to 3 million Kurdish people have been displaced.

Speaking Kurdish is forbidden in Turkey, as is naming children with Kurdish names, according to Gurtovia and media reports. And the State Department said there were credible reports of human rights issues and persecution of Kurdish people in a 2023 report.

Fearing for his life, Abak fled Turkey and arrived in the United States in 2022. He was paroled into the country and had a pending political asylum application, Gurtovaia said.

“We never missed a court date. We were very responsible. We were following every letter of the law,” she said.

Earlier this year, he attended an immigration court hearing where he shared why he had fled the country.

He was persecuted by local authorities, had spent time incarcerated and feared for his life, Gurtovaia said.

“He’s a wonderful young man, but unfortunately, because of his nationality, he faced very difficult times in Turkey. He was followed by [authorities] and that’s why he even served time in jail,” she said.

When he was released, he feared he could be detained without reason again and without money, he and his family would have no means to defend him.

In recent years, human rights watchdogs have denounced the unjust incarceration of Kurdish people. Last year, Turkish authorities sentenced 24 Kurdish politicians to nine to 42 years of prison on bogus charges of crimes against the state, according to the nonprofit Human Rights Watch.

“Justice works very differently in Turkey if you’re Kurdish,” Gurtovaia said.

Abak has no criminal history in the United States, she said. A U.S. immigration judge did not find him to be a high-risk individual, and the couple was waiting for his next immigration court date in January, she said.

Yet, it appears immigration authorities detained him over his arrest in Turkey, Gurtovaia said. While seeking information about his whereabouts, an immigration officer told a family member he had been detained “because he had an open case in Turkey,” related to his arrest, she said.

“I don’t understand how you can grab a person for that, because that’s why this person is afraid of his life and that’s why he’s asking the American government to protect him,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to Block Club’s request for comment.

‘We Both Have A Dream’

Abak and Gurtovaia met in 2023 on a dating app and “fell in love immediately,” she said, smiling through her tears.

Abak works as a manager in auto body shop and Gurtovaia is a teacher in a Russian-speaking educational center. On the side, they both work as rideshare or delivery drivers to earn additional income, desperately needed to pay fees and legal expenses for both of their immigration cases and to build a family together.

“We both have a dream. I have dreams that I have a son who will be like his father and he has a dream that he will have a daughter who will be like me,” she said.

Gurtovaia was born in Russia and is half Ukrainian and half Belarusian. She moved to the U.S. in 2017 after receiving a green card through the immigration lottery. Once she was eligible, she applied for citizenship, she said.

The couple got married about a year ago and lived together in Uptown with their two cats. This December, they planned to continue with a costly fertility treatment. Once a U.S. citizen, she had planned to request permanent residency for Abak through a family-based application, she said.

Those and other plans shattered after immigration agents detained Abak Tuesday, just a day before her naturalization ceremony. He was going to join her for the special day, cook traditional food and celebrate with friends Wednesday night.

“Now I’m just worried because I have heard about the conditions in detention centers and I am not even sure that he has access to water,” she said Wednesday.

Abak was transferred to a detention center in El Paso, Texas Wednesday after being taken to ICE’s processing facility in suburban Broadview Tuesday. He remained in detention in Texas as of Friday morning, according to ICE records.

On Thursday, Gurtovaia was able to speak to him after he called briefly. She had worried after not hearing from him for over a day. They both told each other I love you so much, she said. She promised she’d do anything to help him.

Showered with support from neighbors and officials, Gurtovaia has pledged to fight for her husband’s release.

She was referred to a lawyer and has launched a GoFundMe to raise funds for his legal defense, which could cost thousands of dollars between filing fees and attorney costs. Without Abak’s income, she is facing “crushing” financial pressure, according to the GoFundMe page.

“The process is long, painful, and shockingly expensive. I’m giving everything I have—every hour, every ounce of strength—but I cannot do this alone,” the GoFundMe reads.

Abak’s detention unveils the reality of the country’s broken immigration system, Clay said.

“We don’t have a perfect process that people can follow. And even if they do follow that imperfect process that we have, they’re still being targeted and their lives are in jeopardy,” she said.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/IMG_2851-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-28 17:56:32.441938

Valerie Brown doesn’t personally know her two classmates at Western International High School who were detained Thursday morning by federal immigration officials and sent to Texas, but that didn’t stop her from helping organize a press conference that became a rally for bringing the students home.

“I have friends who have told me they are afraid to go to school. You shouldn’t be afraid to come to school,” Brown told Chalkbeat after speaking during the press conference, saying the fear is magnified by rumors of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking kids “whether they have papers or not.”

“They’re scared to be outside, to be with their friends. They’re kids.”

The press conference was organized to support the two 16-year-old students, who are cousins and attend Western International High School in Southwest Detroit. Outlier Media and Chalkbeat reported Monday that students were born in Venezuela and arrived in the U.S. in 2023. They were taken into custody along with two of their parents when agents raided their home on the Eastide in search of a different migrant.

Brown and others spoke in front of a backdrop at Detroit’s Clark Park. Dozens of people were there, some of them holding signs and shouting “for shame” whenever a speaker brought up something they thought was particularly egregious. All of them called for the release of the teens and the parents.

Some of the speakers, including Valerie, called on school, city, and state officials to be more involved in ensuring the safety of students who fear moving throughout the community because of immigration actions. Some called on the Detroit school district to have an immigration attorney on retainer to assist students who’ve been detained and to ensure students know their rights.

“Instead of the (students) chilling with their friends, they got to be stuck in a detention center with ICE,” Brown said during her speech. “We don’t even know where they’re going. We don’t even know if they’re going to a country that’s theirs or is even safe for them or even if they have family anymore.”

One of the speakers, attorney George Washington, said ICE agents entered the home while the occupants were sleeping. “Suddenly, ICE appears at the door, busts into the place, and tells them that they’re all being arrested.”

All four who were detained had pending asylum petitions, Washington said.

“We have a tremendous immigration lawyer from Detroit who did everything he could,” to assist the four while they remained in Michigan. But, Washington said, they were sent to Texas “too quick.”

“He’s going to continue representing them and we’re going to get them out,” Washington said.

After the event, Sen. Stephanie Chang, a Democrat from Detroit, issued a statement about the detentions:

“I am standing with Detroit teachers, friends, family and community members of these two students in urging their immediate return home to Michigan,” Chang said. “I understand that they have been following the asylum process and have upcoming immigration court dates. ICE should release them and allow them to proceed with the asylum process.”

Many of the youth attending the event were from Western International, located across the street from Clark Park. Others came from schools such as Southeastern, Cass Technical, and Detroit International Academy for Young Women.

Kenneth Russell, who attends Southeastern, was among the speakers.

“It’s better for us to all be connected than apart,” Russell said.

“It’s awful what’s happening,” said Theo Edwards, who’s attended Western for nearly a month. He was holding a sign that said “People are not illegal,” with the “not” underlined. “It’s scary, especially for those who are Hispanic.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ICE-courthouses.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 18:57:00.207699

Zbur, who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers.
Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district.
Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.","At a time when the federal government is dismantling civil rights protections in K-12 schools, California is expanding them — although some wonder how far the state will go to combat discrimination in schools.

A new law, signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom last month, creates an Office of Civil Rights within the California Department of Education. The office will have a staff of at least six, including an antisemitism coordinator, who will educate school districts about the harms of bias and investigate discrimination complaints.

“I think it’s a good idea and the state of California will pull it off. The risks are small and the possibility for good is large,” said Gary Orfield, co-director of the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. “But for it to be successful, it has to have real responsibility and real power.”

The new law stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents in California last year following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Authored by Assemblymember Rick Chavez Zbur (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblymember Dawn Addis (D-Morro Bay), the law is intended to eliminate anti-Jewish and other bias in the classroom and ensure that students of all ethnicities and religions feel protected.

But the road to Newsom’s desk was not smooth. The bill faced tough opposition from the California Teachers Assn. , the state’s largest teachers union, which argued that the law would limit teachers’ right to free speech by curbing their ability to discuss the conflict in Gaza or other topical issues. The union declined to comment for this article.

Zbur, who was among the law’s authors, said the new Office of Civil Rights and the antisemitism coordinator are not intended to punish teachers. The idea, he said, is to help schools stamp out bullying, discrimination and other acts targeting specific groups of students.

“The idea that this law is about policing is hogwash,” Zbur said. “It’s intended to be productive, to provide districts with resources so they can prevent students from being harmed in school.”

Federal layoffs and closures

Discrimination has long been illegal in California schools. Individuals who feel they’ve been discriminated against can file complaints with the state’s Civil Rights Department or with their local school district. But much K-12 anti-discrimination enforcement has fallen on the federal government’s Office of Civil Rights. Created in the mid-1960s, the office investigates complaints about a range of issues, such as school segregation, unfair discipline practices and whether students with disabilities or English learners are receiving the services they’re entitled to.

In March, the Trump administration announced it was laying off nearly half of the U.S. Department of Education workforce and closing numerous branches of the Office of Civil Rights, including the one in California. That’s meant a steep decline in the number of cases and long delays for those the office investigates. In the three months after the Department of Education cuts, for example, the office received nearly 5,000 complaints but investigated only 309.

On Tuesday, the Department of Education went even further, spinning off some of the agency’s largest responsibilities to other federal departments — including much of the administration of elementary and high school funding. Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation’s conservative vision for the country that so far Trump has followed, calls for the Office of Civil Rights to become part of the Department of Justice and for it to “reject gender ideology and critical race theory.”

The U.S. Department of Education didn’t respond to a request for comment.

‘Cutting off funding, that’s what works’

California’s new Office of Civil Rights will have a director and several coordinators who will oversee anti-discrimination cases based on race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and religion. The director and anti-discrimination coordinators will be appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature, likely after Jan. 1.

The office will provide schools with materials about preventing discrimination, and work with districts that have been the subject of complaints from students, families or the public. In serious cases, the office will recommend more intensive assistance to the state Department of Education to correct problems. For districts that persistently flout anti-discrimination laws, “the department may use any means necessary to effect compliance,” according to laws already in place. That may include cutting funding for textbooks or other materials found to be discriminatory.

The office will also submit an annual report to the Legislature on the overall picture of discrimination in schools, including the number of complaints, how they were resolved, and their outcomes.

But to be successful, the office will have to be nonpartisan, transparent and fair, Orfield said. Cases against a school should include strong evidence, and schools should have the opportunity to defend themselves and appeal a verdict if they believe it was wrongly issued.

And the office should not shy away from cutting funds to schools that don’t comply, he said. In the 1960s and ‘70s, the federal Office of Civil Rights cut funds to more than 100 schools in the South that refused to desegregate — a move that may have been the only way to force compliance, Orfield said.

“Cutting off funding, that’s what works,” he said. “Although if you’re going to have sanctions, there must be due process.”

Photo ops and reports?

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation for the public interest law firm Public Counsel, agreed that enforcement will be the key to whether the new office is effective.

“If the office just issues reports and does photo ops, we don’t need another one of those,” Rosenbaum said. “The issue is whether or not they can enforce these rights across the board.”

He’d also like to see the office take a more proactive approach instead of only responding to individuals’ complaints. Education itself, he said, is a civil right, and too many students are not receiving the high-quality lessons in safe, well-equipped schools that they’re entitled to.

Still, he’s happy to see the office get off the ground, particularly in light of the federal cuts to civil rights enforcement.

“There’s an urgency for California to fill a void,” Rosenbaum said. “It should have happened decades ago, but it’s a good start.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d4a733/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2F5d%2F507d868e474f9c83d1da2dde55b6%2F1522997-me-0920-newsom-immig-bills-gem-003.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 16:56:48.050249

After the Trump administration rewrote ICE policy on July 8 to cut off bond hearings for most locked-up immigrants, emergency lawsuits exploded nationwide.

They came from people who’ve spent years, even decades, in the U.S. with clean records while pursuing asylum or other legal status, who were seized at workplaces, courthouses, and routine check-ins.

In more than 700 cases, at least 225 federal judges have found the change to be likely illegal and a due-process violation—including 23 selected by Trump, 79, according to Politico.

Judges across at least 35 states have bristled at the government’s attempt to treat long-time U.S. residents as if they were still “seeking admission,” triggering mandatory detention once reserved for new arrivals, in a reading that breaks with three decades of practice.

Before July 8, most people in deportation proceedings remained free while their cases wound through immigration courts, an executive-branch system that routinely weighed bond.

One judge likened the logic to insisting a movie-theater gatecrasher is still at the door—an interpretation that dozens of courts have rejected as defying common sense.

Joining the chorus blasting the policy, Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder wrote on Nov. 21, “The Court is unable to remain current on all new case authority… given the continued onslaught of litigation.”

In Michigan, Trump appointee Hala Jarbou described more than 100 individual petitions landing in her courtroom before another 97 detainees filed a joint case seeking release, illustrating their sheer volume.

And in Idaho, Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Lynn Winmill wrote that “dozens of district courts across the nation—with more each day—have rejected DHS’s expansion of… mandatory detention,” freeing 17 people seized in an Oct. 19 raid, Politico reported.

Broader relief is now taking shape. Federal judges in Massachusetts and Colorado have certified class actions, while a California judge has approved a nationwide class that could force bond hearings for those held under the July policy, according to Politico’s review.

Appeals courts in the 5th and 8th Circuits are being asked to move quickly. At the same time, the administration has urged slower timetables elsewhere—setting up conflicting clocks and a likely sprint to the Supreme Court.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), ICE’s parent agency in charge of migration in the U.S., argues it’s enforcing the statute.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Politico in a statement.

McLaughlin told the Daily Beast that Trump and Noem were focused on enforcing the law.

“The Board of Immigration Appeals’ recent ruling vindicating DHS on holding aliens without bond was the final nail in the coffin for Biden’s catch and release policies that dangerously unleashed millions of unvetted illegal aliens into American communities—and they used many loopholes to do so,” she said.

Posted on Truth Social on Thursday after an Afghani national who had worked with the US military shot two National Guard members in Washington, DC, the announcement promised a sweeping freeze on admissions from vast stretches of the Global South.

This is in addition to the cancellation of ‘millions’ of Biden-era approvals. It also vowed to strip non-citizens of federal benefits and subsidies and even denaturalise migrants deemed ‘non-compatible with Western civilisation’.

But behind the headline-grabbing language, some experts say nothing has legally changed, arguing that Trump’s vow is still just rhetoric, with no executive order, no proclamation and no use of the powers needed to make it real.

That, they say, leaves the administration’s earlier actions as the operative policy, which already cast a long shadow over African migration.

But that assertion is countered by Federico Manfredi Firmian, a foreign policy expert and research fellow at the Italian Institute for International Political Studies, who argues that the absence of a formal law doesn’t prevent “rapid administrative action”.

Africa already on the front line of Trump restrictions

In June, the White House reinstated and expanded a nationality-based travel ban that fully blocks most entry categories for 12 countries, seven of them in Africa: Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia and Sudan.

For nationals of these states, consular officers have minimal discretion. A second tier of states – Burundi, Sierra Leone and Togo – face partial restrictions affecting certain visa classes. Refusal rates have since surged, and even routine applications have become mired in administrative hold.

This new ‘pause’ is another clear signal that migration to the United States from the Global South is getting harder

Then came the leaked State Department memorandum signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The document lists 36 countries flagged for potential escalation if they fail to meet security and document-verification benchmarks – 25 of them are African.

They range from the continent’s largest economies, including Nigeria, Egypt and Ethiopia, to smaller states such as Cabo Verde, Uganda and Zambia. Although the memo stops short of imposing bans, it explicitly signals the possibility of visa restrictions or full travel suspensions. For many African governments and diaspora groups, it has functioned as a de facto blacklist.

Against this backdrop, Trump’s rhetoric about a ‘Third World’ pause lands less as an entirely new threat than as an intensification and possible widening of a framework already under construction.

However, Trump's latest announcement is more than political theatre, according to Firmian. “This new ‘pause’ is another clear signal that migration to the United States from the Global South is getting harder, with several pathways now being frozen or effectively shut off,” he tells The Africa Report.

What a ‘Third World’ pause might actually mean

If the administration treated ‘Third World’ as shorthand for ‘developing countries’, almost the entire African continent would fall under a single catch-all label. But the White House doesn’t need a sweeping ban to achieve the same political effect.

Politically, the ambiguity gives the administration maximum room to escalate without the diplomatic blowback that a formal proclamation would trigger. It lets officials quietly widen restrictions across the 36 ‘at-risk’ states while insisting they haven’t imposed a continent-wide freeze.

Rather than an outright prohibition, which would almost certainly be struck down as arbitrary and discriminatory, officials are expected to replicate the June 2025 playbook: country-specific dossiers alleging vetting gaps, security risks and bureaucratic failures, dressed up with narrow waivers to signal restraint.

That pathway allows Washington to tighten the screws on African and other migration through rising refusal rates for students, visitors, professionals and family-based applicants, shrinking legal pathways while preserving the appearance of a rules-based process.

Voiding asylum

Trump’s most sweeping promises – shutting down asylum or cancelling African protections en masse – run straight into statutory guardrails Congress built into the system. Under law, anyone on US soil or at its border has the right to seek asylum, reinforced by the non-refoulement rule that bars Washington from sending people back to places where they face persecution.

Those limits were brought into sharp focus in July 2025, when a federal judge halted Trump’s bid to ‘completely shut down’ asylum at the southern border after the administration declared an ‘invasion’ and froze the US Customs and Border Protection One system.

Many Africans with pending applications or existing status could face delays, denials or even removal

That makes it virtually impossible for the White House to void African asylum claims wholesale. Legal experts say it can make screening more onerous, expand detention and slow cases to a standstill but cannot legally erase claims in bulk.

The real vulnerability lies outside US territory. Trump’s January 2025 orders, though partially blocked, have already stranded thousands in northern Mexico, shut down refugee flights and frozen the US Refugee Admissions Programme.

For African refugees in camps in Kenya, Rwanda or the Sahel, the pipeline has collapsed. A formal ‘Third World’ pause would lock that closure in place and raise the political cost of reversing it, even if courts later curb the administration’s reach.

Can African green-card holders or US citizens lose their status?

Trump’s latest escalation – abruptly announcing an end to legal protections for Somali residents in Minnesota and urging authorities to ""send them back to where they came from"" – has sent shockwaves through African communities across the US.

In his Truth Social post, he claimed Minnesota was a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” under Governor Tim Walz and announced the immediate termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme for Somalis in the state. Walz dismissed the move as predictable scapegoating, saying the president was “broadly targeting an entire community” to shift attention.

Minnesota hosts the largest Somali population in the country, with roughly 79,000 residents, though only 705 Somalis nationwide currently hold TPS, according to Congressional data. Many in the community fear that the president’s rhetoric presages something more sweeping, including threats to green-card holders and even naturalised citizens.

It is part of ongoing efforts to unduly politicise migration and unfairly blame migrants for many of the negative things happening in these countries

But the legal firewall protecting permanent residents and citizens remains substantial. Green-card holders can only be removed through individual proceedings based on defined statutory grounds, such as certain criminal convictions or demonstrable immigration fraud.

Naturalised citizens can be stripped of citizenship only if the government proves they lied about material facts during naturalisation. Political views, activism or national origin are not grounds for denaturalisation, no matter the campaign language.

Where the administration does have greater freedom is in temporary humanitarian protections and parole programmes, which can be narrowed, paused or terminated — as the Minnesota decision illustrates. But even the most aggressive use of executive power cannot deliver Trump’s promise to ‘cancel millions’ of admissions.

However, the government has broad authority to slow or suspend visas and refugee processing, review existing green cards and revoke benefits, Firmian says. “Once implementing guidance is issued, many Africans with pending applications or existing status could face delays, denials or even removal.”

Efforts to unduly politicise migration

Uche Igwe, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), says Trump’s rhetoric fits a wider pattern, describing it as “a very myopic oversimplification” of migration, which has become “far more complex”.

“It is part of ongoing efforts to unduly politicise migration and unfairly blame migrants for many of the negative things happening in these countries,” he tells The Africa Report, pointing to the UK, where the Labour government has also moved to tighten immigration rules.

“I hope that this new wave of hostilities will force African countries to look inwards and allow the leaders to develop their countries such that their citizens will stop believing that their salvation and prosperity lie somewhere in the West where they are not wanted,” Igwe says.

Seaside city councilors clashed Monday over whether the city should issue a written statement acknowledging recent federal immigration enforcement activity that residents say disrupted businesses and frightened families, leaving councilors deadlocked after a tense and lengthy debate.

The discussion followed a work session in which councilors agreed the city should publish clear information explaining what it can and cannot do under Oregon law in response to federal actions.

Councilors directed staff to issue a social media post and add prominently placed information on the city’s website— including in the Community Spotlight section— outlining residents’ rights, the role of local police and steps people can take to ensure who is pulling them over.

City Manager Spencer Kyle said the social media post should address what the city can and can’t do, along with informing the public that it is not city police officers conducting immigration enforcement.

Councilors also agreed to notify the public when the city receives its next shipment of “red cards,” wallet-sized rights-information cards soon to be available in City Hall.

“Letting people know these are accessible is important,” Councilor Tita Montero said.

But members sharply disagreed over whether the city should go further and issue a written statement addressing the impact of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity itself.

Several councilors argued silence would send the wrong message.

“I think not saying something at this point would be a sign of cowardice,”

Councilor Seamus McVey said. “They upset a lot of people. They shut down businesses. They gave us no warning. We were as blindsided as everyone else.”

He added that acknowledging those effects was a matter of transparency, not politics. “It is not partisan to say people were hurt and businesses were hurt,” McVey said. “That’s a fact.”

Others pushed back, warning that the city risked overstepping its authority.

“I don’t want Seaside to get in the middle of a federal immigration debate,” Council President Seth Morrisey said. “Our jurisdiction is local. We should stick to what the law says we can do and avoid statements that pull us into something outside our lane.”

Tensions rose as councilors pressed each other to explain that stance.

“At no point has anyone suggested we interfere with federal operations,” McVey said.

Councilor Heidi Hoffman acknowledged that what happens in Seaside is well within the city’s responsibility.

“They (ICE) upset a lot of people. They shut down businesses, and they didn’t give us any prior warning, and so the city was as blindsided as everybody else was,” Hoffman said. “There was no professional courtesy given; they just came in and started doing these things. So I think we can acknowledge that and say we were surprised, too.”

Councilor Christine Binnicker questioned how detailed such a statement would need to be to remain factual.

“If we’re saying businesses shut down, are we prepared to list which ones?” Binnicker asked. “If we’re going to make claims, we need to be able to back them up.”

McVey dismissed that as unnecessary. “There’s a difference between acknowledging some businesses shut down and doxing them,” he said. “We’re not naming people. We’re acknowledging an impact.”

The debate continued for nearly 30 minutes as councilors disagreed over whether acknowledging community disruption constituted political messaging.

“If it’s not written down, it doesn’t exist,” McVey said. “We keep saying these things aloud, but residents need something they can see and point to.”

Others insisted spoken statements and informational posts were enough.

By the end of the discussion, the council appeared split 3–3, with no clear path to consensus.

Mayor Steve Wright said the council is going to have to agree to disagree. “We’re not going to get any further.”

Councilors agreed to move forward with providing materials and updates, which have been made public on the city’s website: cityofseaside.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=29.
