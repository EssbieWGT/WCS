The state's ACLU chapter said it was filing the lawsuit on behalf of six community members. In a release, the organization said agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, along with other agencies, have ""engaged in a series of indiscriminate immigration raids in which masked federal officers in militarized gear brandish rifles and abduct community members from local businesses, streets, and homes.""

The ACLU also alleges the agents have interfered with community members' right to free speech via ""harassment, intimidation, force, and detention,"" such as by using rubber bullets and chemical irritants and arresting observers and protesters.

""This lawsuit asks the court — on behalf of these ordinary people who have come together courageously to stand up for the rights of all Americans — to halt ICE's attack on First and Fourth Amendment rights,"" the ACLU said.

ACLU staff attorney Alicia Granse said the suit asks the court to declare the agents' behavior unlawful and issue an order prohibiting them from carrying out that behavior. The ACLU will also seek a temporary restraining order while the court adjudicates the case.

One of the suit's plaintiffs, Susan Tincher, said she went to observe ICE activity in her Minneapolis neighborhood on Dec. 9, and within 15 seconds of her arrival, she was ""on the ground in handcuffs.""

""There was no warning, no explanation, no chance to comply,"" Tincher said.

Tincher said she was taken to a facility where she was ""put in shackles"" and ""held for five hours"" before being released.

""I did not obstruct. I did not disobey. I did not provoke violence,"" Tincher said. ""I was on a public street and what followed was sudden, brutal and terrifying.""

WCCO has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

ICE agents surged into the Twin Cities for an enhanced enforcement operation earlier this month at the direction of the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security said agents have made more than 400 arrests since then.

The agents have drawn the ire of both community members and Minneapolis city leaders. On Tuesday, Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized ICE after agents held a woman down and dragged her along the ground in south Minneapolis. Agents also deployed chemical irritants, and at one point, an agent used a Taser before yelling, ""Who wants more?"" to a gathered crowd.

""We have been training our officers for the last five years very, very intensely on de-escalation, but unfortunately that is … often not what we are seeing from other agencies in the city,"" O'Hara said.

ICE said agents ""conducted themselves with the utmost professionalism"" in responding to the crowd throwing snow and other objects.

O'Hara joined Mayor Jacob Frey and small business owners on Tuesday to discuss how ICE's presence is economically detrimental to the city.

ACLU of Minnesota Executive Director Deepinder Mayell said the organization will announce further legal action on Thursday.

""Since the launch of Operation Metro Surge, we have witnessed a remarkable string of unlawful activity targeting Minnesota communities and Minnesota values,"" Mayell said. ""This affects us all.""

Republican Rep. Tom Emmer said on X that ""violent offenders are off the streets of Minnesota thanks to ICE and NO thanks to failed Governor Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/15/29958bc9-43e8-4df7-8e06-92e46881b817/thumbnail/1200x630/1c4bd975e66b3f9cf58de1a636232410/slack-imgs.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 21:58:57.646960

We’re writing to you as members of SEIU 503 and as leaders of our Immigration Committee, but also as people who care deeply about our coworkers, our families, and our communities. Tomorrow, Thursday, December 18, our coalition partners at PCUN are calling for the first Day Without an Immigrant—a moment to stand up together as immigrant workers and allies in the face of escalating attacks from the federal government.

Across the country and here in Oregon, people are being targeted, detained, and separated from their families simply because of their names, their accents, or the color of their skin. ICE’s actions are spreading fear in our workplaces and communities, and no one should have to live with that kind of uncertainty just to go to work and care for their families.

A Day Without an Immigrant is about visibility, dignity, and solidarity. It’s a reminder that immigrants are at the heart of our union and our state. Nearly one in five workers in the U.S. is an immigrant, and in every industry—from homecare and farm work to state service and education—our labor keeps Oregon running. When immigrant workers are attacked, it hurts all of us—and when we show up together, we are powerful.

Tomorrow, Thursday, rallies will take place across Oregon in recognition of A Day Without an Immigrant. We invite you to take a break, bring a coworker, and join a rally near you to stand in solidarity with immigrant workers and their families.

This is just the beginning. A Day Without an Immigrant monthly actions will continue through April 1, and SEIU 503 will continue standing shoulder to shoulder with immigrant workers every step of the way. Together, we can reject fear and cruelty—and affirm the dignity, safety, and freedom every worker deserves.

With gratitude and solidarity,

Since Donald Trump took office in January, Pastor Dianne Garcia says 12 members of her church, Iglesia Cristiana Roca de Refugio, have been arrested by ICE and seven have been deported.

“ICE has been very active here in San Antonio. We’ve had a number of members of our congregation detained in various circumstances. Right now there are five members of our congregation currently in detention,” Garcia told Border Report. “In the last three weeks, we’ve had two single mothers detained with their children, one with her 3-year-old toddler and one with her three younger children.”

Garcia says the arrests started six weeks ago. And all were arrested when they went for their mandatory ICE check-in meetings.

“The majority have been arrested when they’ve gone to the ICE office to present themselves for their regularly scheduled check-in,” Garcia says.

The meetings occur about every six months and are a requirement of migrants seeking asylum and who are in immigration proceedings to ensure U.S. officials know of their whereabouts.

“Unfortunately, they’re targeting those people who are trying to follow the law and do the right thing and present themselves, and they’re the ones that are mostly being detained. Almost all of the members of my community have been detained there,” Garcia says.

Border Report asked Department of Homeland Security officials if ICE agents are making arrests at check-in meetings. A DHS spokesperson responded: “Apprehensions at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offices may occur if individuals are identified as having outstanding warrants; being subject to court-issued removal orders; or having committed fraud, crimes, or other violations of immigration law while in the United States. These actions are typically carried out by law enforcement partners, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”

Iglesia Cristiana Roca de Refugio church was founded in April 2023 specifically to help immigrants living in the south side of San Antonio. All of their services are held in Spanish.

“We actually started the church before all of this happened years ago with the idea to be a place of home and belonging for people who were far from their home and are often told they don’t belong here,” said Garcia, 46, is a second-generation immigrant.

She says it’s hard to advise congregants on doing what is right when she feels the government is doing wrong.

“It’s really hard to talk to people about having hope when it feels so hopeless and it feels like you could do everything right and still be treated terribly and be detained and separated from your family or deported. It’s really hard to talk to people about the fact that anyone could be detained at any time, and it doesn’t matter if you don’t have a criminal background, that actually what they’re saying is not what they’re doing, that they are targeting anyone they can, I assume, just to have their numbers at a certain level,” Garcia said.

The Trump administration says it wants to remove all immigrants with criminal backgrounds from the United States.

But the latest data shows that nearly three quarters of those currently detained, as of Nov. 30, have no criminal convictions, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) of Syracuse University.

Garcia says one of the single mothers recently arrested is from Venezuela and in her mid 30s and was a cook in a local restaurant. “She had a work permit and driver’s license and she’s also just a model person. She’s an incredible member of our community and completely beloved by everybody.”

Garcia is not releasing the names of those arrested for fear of retribution against their families.

The women and others who have been arrested are being held at the Karnes County Immigration Processing southeast of San Antonio, and the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, in Dilley, Texas.

She says the facilities are crowded with mothers and children waiting in line for medical care, toiletries, food and even to get their children into daily classes.

She says she has visited congregants at both facilities, including last week.

She says her community is tight-knit, and families affiliated with her members are scared to leave their homes and most know someone who has been arrested and detained by ICE.

“I know of maybe 40 people in detention and 40 families who are trying to work through what they’re going to do now that that member of their family has been detained,” Garcia said. “They really want to be here and want to be a part of our community and they really want to help us build a stronger community and a better world.”",https://www.borderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/12/IMG_1841-1-e1766015328201.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-17 21:59:10.385566

Between July 29 and Oct. 15, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested more than 950 people in Washington. The pace of arrests during those two-and-a-half months far surpasses increases earlier in the year. From Inauguration Day in January to the end of July, arrests totaled just over 1,000.

And as detainments have increased, the share of those with criminal records has dropped. This despite federal authorities claiming that they’re targeting immigrants with violent criminal histories.

Just over 31% of those arrested in Washington between the end of July and mid-October had criminal convictions. Roughly another 17% had pending criminal charges. That’s compared to about 40% and 18%, respectively, in the rest of the year.

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, this month cited the case of a Clark County man who was mauled by a dog during his arrest by ICE as an example of how federal immigration authorities are “terrorizing everyone,” whether they have a criminal record or not.

“This should shock the conscience of every one of us,” she said in a statement. “I do not want to live in an America where federal agents can sic attack dogs on peaceful residents with impunity and face no consequences.”

But even having a criminal history still doesn’t justify allegedly abusing people’s rights, said Vanessa Torres Hernandez, the integrated policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Washington chapter.

President Donald Trump’s campaign has more than doubled deportation arrests compared to last year under President Joe Biden. Nearly 2,000 people in Washington have been arrested since Trump retook office, compared to about 800 over the same period last year. In September alone, federal immigration authorities arrested over 350 in Washington.

Brenda Rodriguez López, executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said the data “affirms what our communities have experienced for months.”

“This represents nearly 2,000 families who have had a loved one taken away from them; 2,000 communities who have suddenly lost a neighbor, a coworker, a friend; 2,000 people who have had to face brutal conditions while in detention and the possibility of permanent separation due to deportation,” she said in a statement.

The spike in arrests in Washington mirrors national trends. The Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts in major American cities, but has yet to specifically target Seattle, despite officials frequently mentioning Washington’s biggest city as on their radar.

The arrest figures come from the Deportation Data Project out of the University of California, Berkeley, where researchers received the information via Freedom of Information Act requests.

It provides a rare statistical look into the Trump administration’s deportation program here and across the nation.

But it’s not comprehensive. For one, it only includes ICE administrative arrests, excluding Customs and Border Protection. And, in some cases, no state is listed for individual arrest records. So the arrest figures for Washington are likely an undercount. They also don’t account for the rest of October and November.

While previous datasets have included more complete information on each arrestee’s country of origin, the latest stats are lacking on that front.

The jump in enforcement followed Congress earmarking $170 billion to carry out Trump’s immigration agenda in the Republican-backed “big, beautiful bill” in July. Federal officials are now using some of the money to buy a half-dozen Boeing planes for deportation flights, instead of relying on chartered jets, according to The Washington Post.

Local advocacy group La Resistencia has seen the increase in arrests as it monitors deportation flights in and out of Boeing Field in Seattle, to either be deported, transferred or held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. This month, the organization is seeing three or four flights per week, compared to one a week last year, said Josefina Mora-Cheung, organizing director.

“The movement of people and the targeting of people is at an unprecedented level that La Resistencia has not seen since we were founded 11 years ago,” Mora-Cheung said.

The increased arrests have stirred worries of overcrowding at the Tacoma detention center. As of Nov. 28, the 1,575-bed facility was holding just over 1,300 people, according to Detention Reports.

In a letter Tuesday, many of the Democrats in Washington’s congressional delegation urged the acting ICE director to release those held at the detention center who don’t pose a public safety threat due to concerns over deteriorating conditions from crowding there.

The state fought for years in court with the facility’s operator, The GEO Group, to inspect it. Despite a recent appeals court ruling in the state’s favor, inspectors still haven’t been able to get in, according to the state Department of Health.

But, Atkinson continued, “with the money from the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ we expect that is something that could happen here in the future, and we want to be prepared.”

That tone of hope — and pragmatism — carried through a panel of speakers, who spoke to a crowd of several hundred people packing the theater at Gray Area in the Mission.

The panel — composed of Atkinson, assistant chief at the public defender’s office Angela Chan, Shira Levine, a former immigration judge fired by the Trump administration, Marissa Hatton, a senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco, and a Peruvian asylum seeker who was detained by ICE — reflected on the past year of immigration crackdown and resistance in San Francisco.

The bilingual panel was moderated by Mission Local immigration reporters Margaret Kadifa and Sage Ríos Mace. Eleven community organizations — legal services, advocacy groups, translation services — set up tables with resource flyers and volunteer forms. Some decorated their table with handmade monarch butterflies, a symbol of migration.

Here are the highlights of what the panelists had to say:

San Francisco’s resistance to ICE is built on years of organizing

Over the past 10 months, San Francisco has witnessed courthouse arrests, protests, and a federal deployment that was called off at the last minute.

But the city’s resistance to treating immigration as a criminal matter began decades before that, said Chan from the public defender’s office. San Francisco has been a sanctuary city since 1989 — meaning that city employees, like police officers, are forbidden from helping federal agents with immigration-related matters.

Making sure that sanctuary legislation actually works, said Chan, has been a long process as well. The legislation has been updated several times, and it’s taken plenty of work along the way to make sure that police are actually following the ordinance.

It took further work to establish California as a sanctuary state, Chan continued, and to help pass protections in other Bay Area counties as well. Today, many of those counties have stronger sanctuary protections than San Francisco does.

When the city braced for a “surge” of federal agents in October, it directed an additional $3.5 million to immigration services. But in the coming year, the city needs to cut its budget by $400 million — it is unclear if pushing back against deportations will be a priority for the mayor going forward.

Immigration attorneys and advocates have also built a response network that spans from legal and translation services to court observer shifts to “adopt a laborer corner” neighborhood watch.

From courthouse arrests to more private places

Attorneys have seen more aggressive enforcement in the Bay Area in cities outside of San Francisco, like Santa Clara, Alameda and Sacramento. There, federal agents conduct larger-scale operations at Home Depot parking lots or day laborer meeting locations.

In San Francisco, arrests at immigration courts have been rare in recent months, but there has been “a huge increase” of arrests at check-ins at ICE’s field office at 630 Sansome St., said Atkinson.

Arrests are now moving to more private spheres, Atkinson said: routine check-ins, marriage green card interviews and asylum interviews outside of court.

Such tactics have already been seen in San Francisco and elsewhere in California. Immigrants were arrested and sent to detention centers out of state after regular in-person ICE check-ins. In San Diego County, federal agents have started to arrest foreign spouses of U.S. citizens at green card interviews since mid November.

These arrests, unlike those at court, are harder to track publicly. At 630 Sansome St., Atkinson said, federal agents target 10 to 20 individuals every day and detain them — many came from outside of San Francisco.

Antonella, a social worker, moved to the United States from South America two years ago. She was one of the asylum-seekers arrested at court by ICE agents in July.

At the time, Antonella told the audience in Spanish, she was terrified. The ICE officers arresting her only spoke English, and forcibly separated her from the interpreter who had been helping her in court.

“They chained me at my wrist, at my feet and on my waist. And they were patting us down constantly,” she said. The agents kept pressuring her to sign a document that was in English. (Ariel Koren, executive director of Respond Crisis Translation, a nonprofit that provides emergency translation services, interpreted for Antonella at the Tuesday panel.)

Antonella was ordered into the back of a van crowded with other detainees, and the group was driven for six hours to a detention center in Mesa Verde near Bakersfield. “We could barely breathe. There was no air in there,” she said. “I was so desperate that I was banging, asking for help. But I was ignored.”

Back in San Francisco, a team of immigration attorneys frantically filed a habeas corpus petition — a novel maneuver that uses federal district court to pull a person out of detention at immigration court, on the grounds that a courthouse arrest in immigration court (which is a civil court, not a criminal one) violates due process and that the person must be released.

“They filed for her, not knowing what the outcome would be,” said Atkinson. The habeas petition worked. “And then her case helped us build up for the next case and the next case after that.”

By September, Atkinson said, “every single person” who was arrested at court would immediately have a habeas petition filed. “Some of them, we were able to get out before they even left San Francisco,” she said.

Atkinson, Levine, the former immigration judge and other organizations are developing a Bay Area Habeas network. Its goal — “a really ostentatious goal” — is to file a habeas petition within a couple of hours for people arrested at ICE check-ins.

“It’s a project!” Levine exclaimed, as the crowd applauded. “But we are already seeing results on the ground.”

The class-action lawsuits going up against ICE

Antonella was one of many asylum seekers who experienced “terrible” conditions at ICE’s 630 Sansome St. facility. At the panel, she described only given beans and water; attorneys say their clients were held for days without a tooth brush, shower or medication.

When detainees asked for medical help, ICE ignored them unless the requests were in English, said panelist Marissa Hatton, senior staff attorney at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco. “What we were finding is that ICE was arresting people at such high rates that they just didn’t know what to do with them and didn’t have the capacity to hold them.”

Hatton is one of the lead attorneys on Pablo Sequen v. Albarran, a lawsuit challenging ICE’s practices of arresting people at immigration courts and holding them for extended periods in inhumane conditions.

The Pablo Sequen legal team won a preliminary injunction in November, requiring ICE to improve the conditions at the holding facility at 630 Sansome St. in downtown San Francisco. ICE is ordered to provide beds, bedding and medical care from professionals and language access to people in its custody.

Another motion in the lawsuit is challenging ICE’s courthouse arrest tactic, arguing that ICE can’t arrest people at courthouses because of the chilling effect of deterring people from showing up in court. Hatton said she anticipated the judge to rule in favor of this motion.

“Once we get that ruling, what we’ll do next is not just to invalidate the practice here in San Francisco, but to declare the ICE policy invalid for the entire nation,” Hatton said.

What comes next

San Francisco’s immigration court has the largest backlog of any immigration court in California, so high that final hearings are being scheduled for as far out as 2029. But it has fewer and fewer judges — the Trump administration has fired 12 judges in San Francisco since April, and two judges are retiring by the end of the year, leaving only seven to hear more than 120,000 cases.

In recent weeks, Department of Homeland Security lawyers have been proposing to close asylum cases in the United States and instead reroute those asylum-seekers into other countries like Honduras, Ecuador or Guatemala.

Attorneys are figuring out how to respond, said Atkinson. The remaining judges seemed to be under pressure to approve the government’s motion, and have signaled to the attorneys that they should appeal these decisions.

In the meantime, however, asylum seekers are at risk of detention, which means, Atkinson continued, that some will either go undercover or leave the country entirely, because they are so afraid of being detained.

It is part of the administration’s plan to “get rid of the cases as soon as possible, in whatever way you can,” added Levine. “What we’re really seeing is just a desire to slice through the cases. I think that’s really scary.”

Levine told the audience that, about two weeks before her September firing, she and her fellow judges had received a memo stating that immigration judges who granted asylum at higher rates than the average must be “biased.” Now an incoming deputy legal director at the Immigration Institute of the Bay Area, she is outspoken about the administration.

“What’s happening here is clearly not about improvements or making things fairer or even making things more efficient,” she said. “What we’re seeing is a dismantling that is attempting to undermine the ability of anyone to have a hearing, to have due process, to see a judge.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 19:57:35.419268

His detention reflects a broader shift in federal enforcement priorities emphasizing mandatory detention over alternatives for supervision.
Momand’s case, and others throughout the country, have demonstrated how much the Trump administration has expanded the nation’s deportation infrastructure.
Ultimately, contemporary U.S. immigration proceedings are increasingly defined by vastly expanded legal discretion and a widening net for non-citizens.
Virginia’s substantial population of Afghan nationals are among many local immigrant groups seeing their futures blurred as a result.","Amid a national immigration crackdown, the fallout from the recent shooting of two National Guardsmen by an Afghan national in Washington, D.C., has thrust the precarious status of Afghan nationals in the U.S. into the spotlight.

In Richmond, Axios reported earlier this week that local Afghan families have seen citizenship oath ceremonies and visa appointments canceled in the wake of the shooting.

According to the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), nearly 200,000 Afghans were relocated to the U.S. as SIV holders, refugees, and asylees between August 2021 and the start of the second Trump term. As reported by the Associated Press, Virginia has resettled more Afghan refugees per capita than any other state.

Back in August, escalating enforcement had already reached Henrico, where 19-year-old Arman Momand, a legal resident from Afghanistan, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and held at the Farmville Detention Center before being released.

Henrico’s Momand is now a green card holder, but he was nearly deported over misdemeanor charges.

He arrived in the U.S. with his family in 2021 and held Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) status at the time of his arrest, a designation for individuals who face retaliation for assisting the U.S. military abroad. Despite receiving no court-issued jail time, Momand was detained by ICE, held for two months at the Farmville Detention Center, and placed into expedited removal proceedings, a process that would have required his return to Afghanistan.

His detention reflects a broader shift in federal enforcement priorities emphasizing mandatory detention over alternatives for supervision. In Virginia, non-citizen arrest rates have tripled within the first seven months of 2025 compared to the last full year, according to available data.

Despite his legal status, “he’d already been detained, and ICE has a lot of discretion in terms of when they let someone go if they have ongoing proceedings,” Momand’s lawyer, Alejandra DeJesus Pinto, said.

While Momand was held in custody, his family continued the process of applying for permanent residency. He ultimately completed his green card interview by video from inside the detention center. The interview was successful, and Momand was granted his green card while still in ICE custody.

After two months, he was released.

Momand’s case, and others throughout the country, have demonstrated how much the Trump administration has expanded the nation’s deportation infrastructure. The second Trump term now includes an increasing number of cases in which the government has moved to deport immigrants with green cards and visas, from high-profile cases like Mahmoud Khalil’s to the review of all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration, including individuals with green cards.

While the countries affected by the administration’s response to the D.C. shooting were not specified, Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said on social media that he has “directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern,” and a USCIS announcement named Afghanistan among 19 “high-risk” countries.

“The president can restrict or suspend entry of immigrants from certain countries or processing of asylums, but his power to do so is limited and subject to court review,” DeJesus Pinto said. “We will have to wait and see how this plays out on a large scale, how far this administration chooses to pursue this, as well as how far the courts are willing to allow them to pursue it.”

The suspected D.C. shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who underwent vetting by counterterrorism authorities before entering the U.S., the Washington Post reported. He first entered the U.S. in 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that helped resettle Afghan nationals following the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. He applied for asylum in December 2024, which was granted in April 2025.

“[The Trump administration] is looking to remove more people, more quickly, with less process,” said Amanda Frost, a professor of law and director of the Immigration, Migration and Human Rights Program at the University of Virginia School of Law. “They’ve made every effort to do that, the Alien Enemies Act being one major example; the attempts to revoke student visas; encouraging people to self-deport; using terrorism as a way to take away student visas.”

“It’s clear that the Trump administration is exploiting this horrible tragedy to further its anti-immigrant agenda, as evidenced by the many policies they have enacted and proposed targeting immigrants and refugees, including Afghans,” said Kimberly Grano, a litigation staff attorney with IRAP. “Blanket efforts to deny or take away immigration benefits, including from individuals already in the U.S., on the basis of nationality, raise serious legal questions.”

In May, the Department of Homeland Security announced it was terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans in the U.S., with the White House stating that they no longer faced a threat in their home country. That same month, the administration welcomed the first group of white South African, or Afrikaner, refugees under an executive order mandating the prioritization of their resettlement, claiming the group faces racial discrimination in South Africa.

The ICE website features a public catalog of recent arrests emphasizing the agency’s focus on the “Worst of the Worst.” On the ground, however, those with minor charges or no charges at all, something multiple federal judges have found unlawful, appear to be increasingly targeted.

Estimates by The Marshall Project found that more than 1,800 people with traffic violations were deported between January and August 2025, and that people with no criminal convictions made up two-thirds of the more than 120,000 deportations between January and May 2025.

Ultimately, contemporary U.S. immigration proceedings are increasingly defined by vastly expanded legal discretion and a widening net for non-citizens. Virginia’s substantial population of Afghan nationals are among many local immigrant groups seeing their futures blurred as a result.

Cantwell, lawmakers: “We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC… Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.”; KUOW: Inside the black box of ICE detention in Tacoma, she watched her wedding day come and go

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and senior member of the Finance Committee, joined Members of the Washington state Congressional delegation in a letter to Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Todd Lyons, expressing grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington, and demanding answers to a long list of questions regarding overcrowding and lack access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for individuals detained at the facility. The population at NWIPC has ballooned over the past year under the Trump administration’s indiscriminate and cruel mass deportation campaign, nearing—and at times exceeding—the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575.

Joining Senator Cantwell in sending the letter to ICE were: Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) and U.S. Representatives Suzan DelBene (D, WA-01), Rick Larsen (D, WA-02), Emily Randall (D, WA-06), Pramila Jayapal (D, WA-07), Kim Schrier (D, WA-08), Adam Smith (D, WA-09), and Marilyn Strickland (D, WA-10).

“Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility,” the Members wrote in their letter. “In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity. None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.”

“It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities,” the lawmakers continued. “With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.”

In the letter, the Members raise concern over the lack of medical care for individuals detained at NWIPC and other ICE facilities, writing: “We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens. Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care.”

The lawmakers’ letter also draws attention to reports from advocates that at least three pregnant women detained at NWIPC over the past year have been unable to receive appropriate medical care. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility.

The Members continued by raising concerns over the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC and difficulty that detained individuals have in accessing legal counsel, writing: “Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients.”

The letter concludes by requesting answers to a list of questions by January 16th regarding capacity and staffing levels at NWIPC, the provision of food and medical care, access to legal counsel, treatment of pregnant women, and recent facility visits. “Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility,” the Members wrote. “We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect. Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.”

Senator Cantwell and other members of Washington state’s Congressional delegation have been conducting oversight of NWIPC throughout this year, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to block congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. After a protracted legal battle over Washington state’s ability to enforce health and safety standards at NWIPC, a federal appeals court ruled in August that the state should be allowed to enforce such standards at the detention center, and that failure to comply could result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation.

In September, Senator Cantwell also joined 13 of her colleagues in sending a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem expressing grave concerns about ICE’s detention practices with respect to detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women and demanding more information about how ICE officers are ensuring that these women are receiving sufficient medical care while in custody.

The lawmakers’ full letter to ICE is available HERE and below:

Dear Acting Director Lyons:?

We are writing to share our grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington and to request information about access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for detained noncitizens at the facility.?Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility. In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity.

None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.

You must ensure the facility complies with the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards as revised in 2016 (PBNDS 2011) to keep detained noncitizens safe and healthy while protecting the rights they are entitled to under law.

It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities. With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.

Medical Care

The federal government has a moral and legal obligation to protect the health of individuals in its custody. We have had long-standing concerns about access to medical services in ICE detention facilities. In recent years, several members of the Washington Congressional delegation requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a comprehensive review of the quality and accessibility of medical services for individuals in ICE custody. At times this year, NWIPC has exceeded 1,500 individuals in custody, nearing the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575 individuals. We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens.

Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care. During an August 2025 site visit, facility staff indicated the facility employed only four behavioral health staffers. There were reports of at least two suicide attempts at NWIPC in April. It is plainly inadequate to have four behavioral health staff serving the 1,500 detainees under the facility’s care, especially given the fact that serious behavioral health issues frequently emerge under the severe stress of detention. We are also alarmed by reports from advocates with access to the facility that at least three detained pregnant women at NWIPC have been unable to receive appropriate medical care, even after they request specialty prenatal care appointments. Regular exams such as ultrasounds are necessary to monitor development and ensure a healthy pregnancy. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility.

Food

The Seattle Times recently reported on the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC as the detained population has increased. Advocates who speak with detainees have shared that meals are provided late and, in some cases, detainees did not receive three meals per day. Detainees have made complaints about food and sanitation for many years, and we urge the facility to be responsive to the nutritional needs of individuals in its custody. Legal service providers with access to the facility have also shared that detainees waiting for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings may miss meals. We urge the facility to ensure that all detained noncitizens, including those awaiting hearings or visits, are provided a minimum of three meals per day, as required by national detention standards (PBNDS 2011).

Access to Legal Counsel

Access to legal resources for noncitizens in immigration detention supports their ability to understand their rights and navigate immigration court, preventing backlogs in the immigration court system. Detained noncitizens at NWIPC face several concerning barriers to accessing legal counsel. Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients. This August, two of the seven attorney visitation rooms were being used as Virtual Attorney Visitation rooms (VAVs) and two were being used for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings, leaving only three rooms available for attorneys to meet with their clients in person. We have also heard from advocates with access to the facility that, at times, only one visitation room was available and interviews for facility staff were being conducted in these attorney visitation rooms.?

In the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress provided $10,000,000 for ICE to improve legal resources for noncitizen detainees, including to expand video attorney visitation. During an August 2025 site visit, NWIPC staff indicated that the facility recently implemented a new scheduling system to reserve attorney visitation rooms. We ask that the facility work with attorneys to resolve any issues that arise with the new system expeditiously so as not to delay access to legal counsel. We urge you to improve access to legal counsel by ensuring attorney visitation rooms remain available for attorneys to meet with their clients.

Given these concerns, we request answers to the following questions by January 16, 2026:

What is the maximum capacity of NWIPC, as determined by the fire marshal? As of November 1, 2025, how many individuals were detained at the facility??

How many staff were employed by NWIPC on January 20, 2025??Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provided direct medical services?

As of November 1, 2025, how many staff were employed by NWIPC? Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provide direct medical services??

As of November 1, 2025, how many pregnant women were detained at NWIPC? How often have these women requested, and how often have they received, prenatal care appointments with a specialist?

How many days in the last six months has the facility not provided three meals each day to every noncitizen in its custody?

Why did the facility not provide three meals each day to every noncitizen?

For each day, for how many noncitizens were three meals not provided?

What is the current status of the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) at NWIPC? Are noncitizens able to access LOP daily? What are the hours of availability each day? Outside of hours, are there any other restrictions on daily LOP access, and if so, what are they and why are they in place?

How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for in-person attorney meetings? How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for virtual attorney meetings?

In the last six months, have the attorney visitation rooms been used for a purpose other than attorney-client meetings (in-person or virtual) or video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings?

When were the most recent facility visits by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General, DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and ICE oversight personnel (whether the Office of Professional Responsibility or otherwise)? What, if any, recommendations were made after each visit? What progress has been made to implement such recommendations?

OIDO issued a report in November 2024 following an inspection of NWIPC. While 11 of the recommendations have been addressed, one remains outstanding. What progress has been made on implementing the remaining recommendation? ?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility.

We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect.

Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.

The Trump administration’s ramped up federal immigration enforcement is putting those questions “front and center” she said.","Federal immigration agents are violating Minnesotans’ constitutional rights in the course of their large-scale enforcement action in the Twin Cities, according to allegations in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota (ACLU) is leading a suit accusing Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of violating the First and Fourth Amendment rights of Minnesotans by harassing people documenting enforcement activity and by detaining U.S. citizens.

The six plaintiffs include Abdikadir Noor, a Somali American who experienced racist rhetoric when he was detained by ICE for more than four hours on Monday and Susan Tincher, a north Minneapolis resident who was detained and had her wedding ring cut off by ICE agents after observing an arrest in her neighborhood.

“Our ultimate goal is to protect what Minnesotans want to do when they disagree with their government,” said Alicia Granse, a staff attorney with the ACLU.

The ACLU filed the suit in coordination with lawyers from Ciresi Conlin, Forsgren Fisher and Riach Law. The suit is the first major legal challenge to ICE action in Minnesota, which has exploded this month under what the agency calls Operation Metro Surge.

“Since the launch of Operation Metro Surge, we have witnessed a remarkable string of unlawful activity targeting the Minnesota community and Minnesota values,” ACLU Executive Director Deepinder Mayell said.

Some plaintiffs in the lawsuit were intimidated by ICE agents, according to the lawsuit. One, Alan Crenshaw, was sprayed with chemical irritants while protesting ICE activity in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis. ICE agents in Richfield allegedly pointed guns at married couple Janet Lee and John Biestman and told them: “We have your license plate. We know where to find you.”

The lawsuit is attempting to create a protected class of people who observe, document and protest federal immigration actions in Minnesota, Granse said. As part of the suit, the ACLU intends to seek a temporary restraining order to give Minnesotans additional legal protections while the case moves through the court.

Somali American arrested, experienced racism at hands of ICE

Noor, a 45-year-old Fridley resident who has been a U.S. citizen for 20 years, was going to get coffee at Karmel Mall in Minneapolis on Monday when he was pulled over by ICE, according to the lawsuit. His arrest was part of a high profile ICE action near Pillsbury Avenue that was featured in several news articles.

Another car with Latino occupants was stopped at the same time as Noor, according to the lawsuit. When Noor realized it was ICE and not the police, he told agents that he knew his rights and wouldn’t show them anything. The agents then targeted the vehicle with Latino occupants. Noor also encouraged people in that vehicle to assert their rights.

A crowd formed and the situation became tense. Agents began scuffling with a woman who crowd members said was pregnant, throwing her to the ground, according to the suit. Noor was trying to calm the crowd when he was suddenly thrown to the ground and arrested, according to the lawsuit.

With Noor in custody, an ICE agent sped down the highway to the federal Whipple Building near Fort Snelling, not allowing Noor to buckle his seatbelt, according to the lawsuit. As he was processed by ICE, the agent examining his passport told another officer, “They all come here fraudulently. Fifty percent are here fraudulently,” according to the lawsuit. The agent allegedly said that “Somalis should go back home.”

Noor was shackled and placed in a room alone for about four hours, according to the lawsuit, before eventually being read his rights. He was released without any charges or paperwork at about 6 p.m.

“The whole time I was there at the scene, I just wanted to tell the government that what they were doing to the woman, to the Latinos, to all of us, is wrong,” Noor said in a statement included in the lawsuit. “I just wanted to tell people what their rights are in this country and under our Constitution.”

ICE actions causing chaos, difficult to track

Noor is one of several Somali Americans to be detained by ICE during Operation Metro Surge.

Last Tuesday, Mubashir, a 20-year-old Somali Minneapolis resident, was arrested by federal officers in Cedar-Riverside despite repeatedly telling officers of his U.S. citizenship. He offered to show them his I.D. on his phone, but they ignored him.

Several immigrant advocacy groups and elected officials say federal officers are racial profiling people to stop and detain them. Federal officers were seen driving around immigrant-dense neighborhoods, like Cedar-Riverside and near E. Lake Street, stopping to question people on public streets about their immigration status, Miguel Hernandez, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, said in an interview last week.

Federal officers confronting immigrants to question and arrest them is a major shift from past large-scale enforcement actions that drew crowds of protesters, he said, such as the ICE raid at Bro-Tex in St. Paul.

“I think they figured out this community is going to stand up and resist and that larger operations are not effective because they get bogged down by the community asking for accountability,” he said. “These smaller snatch-and-grab units can just disperse to grab and go quickly.”

Since the beginning of Operation Metro Surge, Hernandez said it’s been difficult to track ICE arrests.

“It’d be like trying to count water,” he told the Sahan Journal. “You can measure it in volume, but it gets everywhere.”

More legal challenges could come

In September, the Supreme Court issued an emergency action to temporarily allow officers to make arrests based on race, language and occupation. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a Tuesday morning news conference that he is working with legal partners and intends to file legal action on federal enforcement action. He did not specify when he’ll file, he added.

Other states, such as California and Chicago — the locations of ICE operations that occurred in recent months — have pending lawsuits against the Trump administration challenging the use of racial profiling on immigration-related arrests.

“This seems to be very much about content, fear and a disregard of the rule of law as opposed to law and order,” said Simon Trautman Cordova, an associate attorney for the Minnesota Justice Coalition.

In Mubashir’s case, he told officers multiple times that he had proof of U.S. citizenship and without evidence disproving that, continuing to detain and fingerprinting him violates his Fourth Amendment right, Catherine Ahlin-Halverson, an attorney for the ACLU, told Sahan Journal.

She also said a person detained by federal immigration officers without a warrant has the right to remain silent or verbally tell officers about their rights. They can also ask to leave or call an attorney, but it’s not guaranteed officers will grant it.

For decades, holding officers accountable for violating a person’s constitutional rights during an immigration-related arrest or questioning is “really hard,” said Michele Garnett McKenzie, executive director of the Advocates for Human Rights, a nonprofit legal organization.

“In the immigration context, those checks and balances are really missing,” she said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference hosted by the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The Trump administration’s ramped up federal immigration enforcement is putting those questions “front and center” she said.

In addition to targeting neighborhoods and immigrant-owned businesses during Operation Metro Surge, federal agents have waited outside homes to arrest immigrants, according to immigrant advocacy groups. In public spaces, like on the street, federal officers have the authority to question or detain someone they suspect to be violating immigration law, immigration attorneys say.

“It’s crucial to continue to shed light on the unlawful conduct by ICE agents and the brutality and cruelty in which they are pursuing Minnesotans regardless of their immigration status,” Ahlin-Halverson said.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2025-12-17_ACLU-Press-Conference-13.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 19:01:30.275644

“The crisis we’re having has a lot of similarities to the crisis that was happening over 250 years ago,” Katy Dirks, a member of Boston Indivisible’s leadership council, said in an interview. “Families are afraid to go out of their homes. We’re outraged right now, and we’re standing up for our neighbors.”

Holding “No Kings” and anti-ICE signs, the group marched along Milk and Congress streets before reaching Waterfront Plaza. Protesters then dumped “clean ice,” per guidance from MassDEP and Boston Conservation Commission, into the harbor next to the Boston Tea Party Ships & Museum.

The protest also aimed to bring light to the “Trump Administration’s corruption, authoritarianism, and destruction of our democratic norms,” the groups said.

“I think this is one of the most brutal regimes we’ve had in this country, and I want my niece and nephew to remember that it’s important to protest, and that we in Boston are part of a proud tradition of dumping things into the harbor with which we disagree,” Sarah Sievers, of Cambridge, told The Boston Globe at the protest.

“Federal agents’ unlawful, unconstitutional, and distasteful conduct has inspired widespread protests throughout the Twin Cities Metro area, as well as a surge in people observing and documenting ICE activity in their cities and neighborhoods,” the lawsuit states. “Defendants have met this upswell of First Amendment protected conduct and expression with an explosion of constitutional violations.”

The lawsuit names several federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Director Todd Lyons.

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS has reached out to ICE for their response to the lawsuit but has not heard back.

You can read the full lawsuit below.

One of the plaintiffs, north Minneapolis resident Susan Tincher, made headlines last week when ICE arrested her as she observed an immigration raid the morning of Dec. 9 near the intersection of North 21st and Oliver avenues. She says she was tackled and placed in handcuffs within 15 seconds of arriving on scene and had only asked an agent, “Are you ICE?”

Tincher was taken to the Whipple Federal Building near Fort Snelling, where federal officers allegedly cut her bra off, removed her boots and cut the laces, and cut her wedding ring from her finger. In the lawsuit, Tincher attested that she declined to talk with law enforcement without a lawyer present.

When Tincher was eventually released, federal officers told her she would be charged with obstruction. ICE eventually released a statement claiming Tincher “assaulted a federal agent” and “became violent” before her arrest; however, eight days later, no charges have been filed against her.

Another plaintiff and U.S. citizen, Abdikadir Noor, was arrested by ICE agents on Tuesday as he stood among a crowd of protesters near Karmel Mall in south Minneapolis. Noor witnessed an ICE agent kneeling on the back of a protester who was reportedly pregnant, and Noor joined bystanders in yelling at them to let her go, the lawsuit states.

As the crowd continued to yell at agents to let the woman go, with some throwing snowballs, Noor attested to telling people to calm down and be peaceful. When the agent kneeling on the woman’s back began dragging her on the pavement, Noor and others followed. When the woman eventually escaped, agents allegedly focused in on Noor, threw him to the ground, and arrested him.

The lawsuit states Noor was taken to the Whipple Federal Building, where agents made comments disparaging Somalis, echoing unsupported claims by Noem that “50% are here fraudulently.” Noor says he was released later that day without charges or an explanation for his arrest.

An ICE spokesperson called the clash at 28th Street and Pillsbury Avenue a “dangerous riot.” Accounts from the Minneapolis Police Department and the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office — which both sent officers to assist after receiving reports from DHS of “60 to 70 agitators” — do not support those claims.

The Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said its deputies “did not witness any attacks or any agents needing medical attention.” An MPD spokesperson said its officers responded “immediately” and cleared out within 10 minutes after finding “there was no one being assaulted and no life-safety conditions that warranted further involvement.”

Other plaintiffs listed on the ACLU lawsuit reported incidents of ICE agents pepper spraying protesters in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis and boxing in observers’ cars and pointing guns at them when they had followed federal agents’ vehicles.

The judge ruled on Wednesday that it is likely illegal for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to demand a week's notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden, concluded that the seven-day notice requirement likely exceeds the Department of Homeland Security's statutory authority.

“Plaintiffs have an interest in facts about whether facilities are overcrowded or unsanitary, whether the staff is engaging in abuse, or the location of constituents or their family members,” the judge wrote.

Twelve Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington, D.C., in July to challenge ICE's amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. They also challenged a policy excluding ICE field offices as facilities that members of Congress are entitled to visit without notice. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump's administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.

Government attorneys argued that the plaintiffs don't have legal standing to bring their claims. They also said it's merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. The judge rejected those arguments.

“The changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,” the Washington-based Cobb wrote in her 73-page decision.

A dozen House Democrats sued over the policies in July, complaining of abruptly imposed limits on the access they had long enjoyed. The Department of Homeland Security has attacked congressional Democrats over their complaints, saying the restrictions were meant to maintain order in ICE facilities and protect agents and officials doing their jobs.

The policies were adopted several weeks after a visit by three Democratic members of Congress to Newark’s Delaney Hall immigration facility, which became the scene of a skirmish among lawmakers, aides and ICE officials after the lawmakers intervened to prevent the arrest of Mayor Ras Baraka. One of the Democrats, Rep. LaMonica McIver, was charged in June with assaulting an ICE officer.

The issue of lawmakers’ access to detention facilities flared again in October when, during the prolonged government shutdown, ICE stopped facilitating many congressional visits, citing staff limitations and also insisting that without federal funding, the agency was no longer required to give lawmakers unfettered access. But when President Donald Trump signed a new government funding bill last month, it included the same requirement for congressional access as those adopted in previous annual funding bills.

Justice Department attorneys urged Cobb to limit any relief in the case to the lawmakers who filed the lawsuit, but Cobb declined. She said the “normal remedy” in the D.C. Circuit is to set aside agency policies that are deemed to be unlawful.

Cobb’s ruling is not a final one on the legal issues in the case, but blocks the new policies as the litigation continues.

In an era marked by war, economic hardship, environmental crises, and the universal search for dignity, migration has become one of the defining realities of our time.

Migration in the Quran: A Path of Faith, Dignity, and Renewal

The Holy Qur’an presents a compassionate and profound vision of migration. God describes the Earth as vast and open for those seeking safety and dignity, “Was not the earth of God spacious enough for you to migrate therein?” (4:97). This verse not only condemns oppression but also reproaches those who resign themselves to tyranny while safe migration remains possible. In Islam, hijrah is an act of courage, faith, and self-preservation.

The Quran praises the Muhajirun (those who migrated) and the Anṣar (those who sheltered and supported them), “Those who believed and migrated… and those who sheltered and supported them—these are the true believers” (8:74).

The Just King: Al-Najashi and His Noble Hospitality

In the first migration in Islamic history, a group of persecuted Muslims fled Mecca seeking freedom of worship in Abyssinia. The Christian king, al-Najashi, welcomed them with justice and compassion, granting them safety at a time when they faced severe oppression.

Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp) praised and honored al-Najashi, and his moral stance remains a source of pride across religious traditions. His example demonstrates that true hospitality transcends borders, politics, and religious identities, and that societies rooted in compassion and justice grow stronger—not weaker.

Islamic Teachings on Supporting Migrants

Prophet Muhammad (pbuh&hp) and the Ahl al-Bayt (p) consistently emphasized kindness, justice, and protection for the displaced.

The Prophet (pbuh&hp) said, Whoever hears a man calling out, ‘O Muslims, help me!’ and does not respond to him, is not a Muslim” (al-Ḥurr al-Amili, Wasaʾil al-Shia, vol. 15, p. 141).

In this noble teaching, refugees and displaced individuals are among the clearest examples of the oppressed (al-maẓlumin). Muslims, and especially Islamic governments, are therefore obligated to offer them protection and to use all available means to alleviate their suffering and remove injustice.

Supporting migrants is not a political preference; it is a moral and spiritual duty.

Duties of Host Communities

Host societies bear profound responsibilities toward migrants and refugees. From an Islamic ethical framework, these include:

Providing safety, dignity, and non-discrimination

Offering access to education, work, and pathways to rebuild life

Supporting spiritual, social, and emotional well-being

Recognizing the opportunities migrants bring: creativity, skills, and cultural enrichment

History demonstrates that immigrants have played pivotal roles in advancing science, culture, medicine, technology, and economic development worldwide.

Responsibilities of Migrants

Migrants also bear significant responsibilities rooted in Islamic ethics:

Respecting the laws, values, and social norms of their new home

Contributing positively through work, education, and community life

Upholding honesty, trustworthiness, and respect

Maintaining their faith and moral identity while engaging constructively with society

The Prophet (pbuh&hp) said, “A Muslim is one from whose hand and tongue other Muslims are safe” (Man La Yaḥḍuruhu al-Faqih, vol. 4, p. 362).

The Root Causes of the Migration Crisis in the Islamic World

According to numerous United Nations reports, a significant proportion of today’s migrants and displaced persons are Muslims from countries suffering from injustice, corruption, tyranny, and political instability.

As long as these deep crises remain unresolved, migration will continue, and likely intensify.

This crisis cannot be resolved by deporting migrants, imposing restrictions, or pressuring them to settle in third countries. Such policies contradict the teachings of Islam and Christianity, and history has repeatedly shown their failure.

Lasting solutions require:

Eliminating injustice,

Reforming unaccountable governments,

Ending corruption,

Restoring human dignity, and

Addressing the underlying social and political causes of displacement.

A Closing Reminder

On this International Migrants Day, we reaffirm that the dignity of every human being, regardless of nationality, race, or immigration status, is sacred.

Islam teaches that helping the vulnerable, welcoming the stranger, and offering refuge to the oppressed are acts of worship and manifestations of justice.

The migration crisis will not be resolved through exclusion or closed borders, but through just governance, moral responsibility, and addressing the root causes of oppression. Anti-migrant policies are neither humane nor sustainable nor aligned with prophetic ethics. As the Muhammadan example and the noble conduct of al-Najashi remind us: A society grounded in compassion will flourish, and migrants who embody integrity and responsibility will become sources of blessing.

We pray that God grants dignity to all migrants, strength to their families, justice to the oppressed, and compassion and wisdom to the communities that receive them.",https://imam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/vecteezy_international-migrants-day-design-templets_74278984.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 17:01:05.546635

U.S. Travel Ban Expanded: Full and Partial Country List

On December 16, 2025, the White House issued a major expansion of the U.S. travel ban, building on the Presidential Proclamation that first took effect on June 9, 2025. The update significantly broadens the number of countries subject to full travel bans and partial travel restrictions, impacting both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa processing.

The new travel ban will become effective at 12:01 am ET on January 1, 2026.

Countries with a Full Travel Ban

Nationals of the following countries are generally prohibited from entering the United States in all immigrant and nonimmigrant visa categories, subject to limited exceptions:

Afghanistan

Burkina Faso (newly added)

Mali (newly added)

Niger (newly added)

South Sudan (newly added)

Syria (newly added)

Burma (Myanmar)

Chad

Republic of the Congo

Equatorial Guinea

Eritrea

Haiti

Iran

Laos (newly added)

Libya

Sierra Leon (newly added)

Somalia

Sudan

Yemen

Palestinian Authority–issued passport holders (treated as equivalent to a country ban)

This list reflects the original 12 full-ban countries included in the June 2025 proclamation, plus additional countries announced in December 2025.

Countries with Partial Travel Restrictions

These countries are subject to restrictions that typically suspend immigrant visas and select nonimmigrant categories (such as B, F, M, and J), but do not constitute a full entry ban:

Angola (newly added)

Antigua and Barbuda (newly added)

Benin (newly added)

Côte d’Ivoire (newly added)

Dominica (newly added)

Gabon (newly added)

Gambia (newly added)

Malawi (newly added)

Mauritania (newly added)

Nigeria (newly added)

Senegal (newly added)

Tanzania (newly added)

Tonga (newly added)

Zambia (newly added)

Zimbabwe (newly added)

Burundi

Cuba

Togo

Turkmenistan

Venezuela

Notably, Laos and Sierra Leone were previously subject to partial restrictions but have since been elevated to the full travel ban category under the December 2025 expansion and are therefore no longer listed here.

Key considerations:

Restrictions are based on nationality and passport type, not country of residence.

Full bans affect all visa categories; partial bans affect immigrant visas and select nonimmigrant visas.

Waivers and exceptions remain limited and highly case-specific.

Significant travel and visa processing disruptions are likely for affected nationals.

Impact: In-house global mobility teams should promptly identify affected employees and dependents, reassess travel and visa-stamping strategies, prepare for increased employee inquiries, disrupted assignments, and compliance planning as the expanded travel ban takes effect.

Gold Card Program: Speed vs. Stability

USCIS has formally launched the Gold Card immigrant visa program with the release of Form I-140G, created under Executive Order 14351, following a soft rollout and new online filing interface. Applicants must first register through trumpcard.gov and receive confirmation before USCIS will invite them to file Form I-140G via a USCIS online account. A separate Platinum Card program has been announced but is not yet available.

The Gold Card requires a minimum $1 million non-refundable contribution and a $15,000 filing fee per person, including the principal applicant and each dependent. Where a corporation or similar entity files on behalf of an individual, the required contribution increases to $2 million for the principal beneficiary plus $1 million per dependent, in addition to filing fees. Visa numbers will be allocated from EB-1 and EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) categories, not EB-5, raising concerns about added pressure on already backlogged visa classifications.

Although public guidance suggests expedited processing, USCIS has provided limited clarity on actual timelines. While the program’s website indicates cases “should take weeks” once fees and applications are received, practitioners caution that processing could take much longer in practice, particularly due to quota constraints, increased scrutiny, and anticipated litigation. All grounds of inadmissibility apply, and heightened review is expected for source of funds and prohibited entity employment. No refunds are available, even if the program is later challenged or rescinded.

Key considerations and open risks:

Program durability: Established by executive order with no statutory or regulatory framework; subject to legal challenge or revocation.

Visa allocation: Gold Card cases draw from EB-1 and EB-2 NIW visa numbers, potentially extending existing backlogs.

Cost structure: $1M non-refundable contribution per individual; $15,000 filing fee per person; higher thresholds for corporate filers.

Family impact: Separate contribution and filing required for each dependent.

Processing uncertainty: Limited clarity on timelines despite promises of expedited adjudication.

Adjustment uncertainty: Form language suggests consular processing only, which may restrict work authorization and travel during adjudication.

Compliance scrutiny: All inadmissibility grounds apply; increased focus on source of funds and restricted entities.

Litigation exposure: Legal challenges anticipated; no refund protection for applicants.

The administration has also announced a forthcoming Trump Platinum Card, requiring a $5 million contribution and a $15,000 processing fee, which would allow eligible applicants to spend up to 270 days per year in the U.S. without U.S. tax on non-U.S. income. Eligibility, filing mechanics, and long-term durability remain unclear.

Impact: For in-house global mobility teams, the Gold Card introduces elevated legal, quota, and employee-advisory risk. Until statutory durability, visa allocation impact, and adjustment mechanics are clarified, the program should be positioned cautiously and evaluated only for narrowly tailored cases, with clear risk disclosure and alternative pathways identified.

States Challenge $100,000 H-1B Fee Proclamation

On December 12, 2025, 20 U.S. states filed a federal lawsuit challenging the September 19 Presidential Proclamation and related agency policies that impose a $100,000 fee on certain H-1B petitions. The case, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, is the third legal challenge to the proclamation and fee structure.

The challenged policy bars approval of H-1B petitions filed after September 20, 2025 that are filed for, or only approvable through, consular notification, unless the employer pays the $100,000 fee, obtains a national interest exception, or the employee is otherwise exempt. The plaintiff states argue that the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act due to lack of notice-and-comment rulemaking, exceeds agency authority by imposing fees unrelated to administrative costs, and is arbitrary and capricious. The lawsuit also raises constitutional separation-of-powers concerns.

The plaintiff states are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. Defendants include the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Labor, and Justice.

This lawsuit follows two earlier challenges to the same proclamation, including one filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to temporarily block enforcement of the fee. A district court hearing on that injunction is scheduled for December 19, 2025.

Impact: Ongoing court challenges leave the $100,000 H-1B fee in flux, requiring in-house teams to plan conservatively for consular H-1B filings and remain ready to adjust strategy as court decisions emerge.

California’s New “Stay or Pay” Restrictions

Starting January 1, 2026, California’s AB 692 sharply restricts employers from requiring employees or candidates to repay employer-funded costs if they leave or don’t start employment. This includes provisions commonly used in mobility programs, such as repayment of immigration, visa, relocation, training, tuition, and certain sign-on or retention bonuses tied to a service period. The law applies to new contracts entered into on or after January 1, 2026, and allows employees or applicants to bring civil actions, with potential penalties of actual damages or $5,000 per violation, plus attorneys’ fees. While limited exceptions exist, the default in California is now a broad prohibition on “stay or pay” arrangements.

Even outside California, similar repayment provisions are constrained by state wage laws and the FLSA, including minimum wage, overtime, and exempt salary-basis rules, making enforcement risky in many jurisdictions.

Impact: This law shifts away from cost-recovery models, limiting repayment of immigration and relocation expenses for California-based employees and increasing the need for compliant, upfront benefit design and closer coordination with employment counsel.

Holiday Travel Alert: Visa Delays and Revocation Activity

The Alliance of Business Immigration Lawyers (ABIL) is reporting significant winter travel disruptions affecting H-1B and H-4 visa holders, driven by expanded social media and online presence screening and heightened security review. U.S. consulates, particularly in India, have canceled or rescheduled many visa appointments, creating widespread uncertainty for travelers.

Attorneys have confirmed that December 2025 H-1B and H-4 appointments in Hyderabad and Chennai are being pushed into March, April, May 2026, or later, with additional delays expected at other posts. Screening requirements have caused confusion among applicants, and consular officials in India have cited concerns that 70–80% of cases involve fraud, contributing to increased scrutiny and reduced appointment capacity.

Separately, the Department of State has initiated visa revocation actions for some H-1B visa holders based on prior arrest history, including arrests dating back several years. While visa revocation does not automatically terminate lawful U.S. status, it can prevent reentry and significantly increase travel risk.

Key takeaways:

Severe appointment delays: India visa stamping now extending well into mid-2026.

Expanded screening: Social media and online presence checks slowing adjudications.

Heightened scrutiny: Fraud concerns driving stricter review at consular posts.

Revocation risk: Prior arrest history may trigger visa cancellation.

Travel caution: Employees should confirm appointments before departure and avoid non-essential travel.

Impact: In-house global mobility teams should treat international travel, especially to India, as high risk this winter and early 2026, reinforce pre-travel approvals, and proactively counsel H-1B and H-4 employees to plan for extended delays or postpone discretionary travel where possible.

USCIS Updates Photo Requirements for Immigration Filings

USCIS issued new guidance on December 12, 2025, effective immediately, limiting the age and type of photographs that may be used for many immigration applications. In most cases, photos used to produce immigration documents may not be more than three years old, though USCIS retains discretion to require a newer photo even when an existing image is available.

For certain filings, USCIS will require a new photograph and new biometrics regardless of when the last photo was taken, including applications to replace permanent resident cards, applications to register permanent residence or adjust status, and applications for naturalization or certificates of citizenship. USCIS also confirmed that self-submitted photos will no longer be accepted; only photos captured by USCIS or other authorized entities may be used.

Impact: In-house global mobility teams should expect additional biometrics appointments, longer case timelines, and potential filing delays, and should proactively set employee expectations around new photo and biometrics requirements when planning applications or renewals.

DOS Updates Visa Interview Scheduling Rules

On December 12, 2025, the Department of State (DOS) updated its instructions for all nonimmigrant and immigrant visa applicants scheduling consular interview appointments, reinforcing stricter location requirements tied to nationality and residence.

For nonimmigrant visas, applicants are expected to schedule interviews at a U.S. embassy or consulate in their country of nationality or residence. Nationals of countries where the U.S. is not conducting routine nonimmigrant visa operations must apply at a designated embassy or consulate, unless they are lawfully residing in another country.

For immigrant visas, applicants must generally interview in the consular district designated for their place of residence, or in their country of nationality if requested, with limited exceptions. Applicants residing in countries where routine visa operations are paused must apply at their designated immigrant visa processing post, unless they hold nationality in a country where routine processing continues. DOS has published a list of designated processing posts to guide applicants.

Impact: These changes limit third-country visa processing options and may require earlier, more deliberate travel and appointment planning by in-house teams to avoid scheduling errors and case delays.

DHS Ends TPS Designation for Ethiopia

On December 12, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Ethiopia. Ethiopian nationals who do not have another lawful basis to remain in the United States have 60 days to voluntarily depart the country.

DHS indicated that after February 13, 2026, it may arrest and deport Ethiopian nationals who remain in the U.S. without status following the TPS termination. DHS is encouraging affected individuals to use U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s CBP Home Mobile App to report their departure and self-deport. DHS stated that use of the app may include a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and potential eligibility for future lawful immigration options.

Impact: This change may affect employees or family members relying on TPS, requiring timely outreach, careful counseling on alternative pathways, and thoughtful support as departure or status changes are considered.

DHS Ends Family Reunification Parole Programs

On December 12, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of all categorical Family Reunification Parole (FRP) programs for nationals of Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras, as well as their immediate family members. DHS stated it is returning parole determinations to a case-by-case basis.

Individuals who were paroled into the United States under an FRP program and whose parole has not expired by January 14, 2026, will have their parole terminated on that date unless they have a pending Form I-485 (application to register permanent residence or adjust status) that was filed by December 15, 2025 and remains pending on January 14, 2026. For those with a timely filed and pending I-485, parole will remain valid until either the parole period expires or DHS issues a final decision on the application, whichever occurs first. If the I-485 is denied, parole will terminate immediately and the individual is expected to depart the United States.

DHS also confirmed that termination of parole under the FRP programs will result in revocation of employment authorization tied to that parole. Affected individuals will receive individual notice of parole termination and employment authorization revocation.

Impact: The termination of FRP programs creates immediate compliance considerations, requiring in-house teams to confirm eligibility to remain and work in the U.S. and to prepare for employment authorization revocation where adjustment filings are not in place.

Costa Rica Added to Global Entry Program

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has announced that qualified citizens of Costa Rica are now eligible to apply for the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program, expanding the list of participating partner countries. Approved members receive expedited immigration and customs clearance when entering the United States at participating airports. Costa Rica joins existing Global Entry partner countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and others.

Costa Rican citizens seeking Global Entry must create an account on CBP’s Trusted Traveler Programs (TTP) website, submit an online application, and pay a $120 non-refundable fee. Applicants are subject to background checks and an in-person interview with CBP. Once approved, Global Entry membership is valid for five years, though violations of program rules may result in revocation.

Enrolled Costa Rican Global Entry members may also be eligible for TSA PreCheck, allowing for expedited security screening at participating U.S. airports.

Impact: This update creates an opportunity for eligible Costa Rican employees and business travelers to streamline U.S. entry and airport security processing, potentially reducing travel friction for frequent travelers.

DOL Updates PERM and Prevailing Wage Processing Times

The Department of Labor (DOL) has released updated processing time data for PERM labor certification and prevailing wage determinations (PWDs) as of December 1, 2025, confirming continued backlogs across labor filings. DOL is currently conducting analyst review for PERM applications filed in July 2024 or earlier and audit review for applications filed in November 2024 or earlier, while reconsideration requests submitted in August 2025 or earlier remain under review.

For prevailing wages, DOL is issuing PERM PWDs filed in July 2025 (OEWS-based) and April 2025 (non-OEWS-based), as well as H-1B PWDs filed in July 2025 (OEWS-based) and May 2025 (non-OEWS-based). The agency is also working through PERM and H-1B prevailing wage redeterminations requested in July 2025, along with PERM Center Director Reviews submitted in October 2025. Detailed timelines are available on the DOL FLAG page.

Processing delays may be further exacerbated by operational constraints. Labor filings submitted with the $100,000 fee have reportedly not yet seen adjudications, and a 33-day DOL closure resulted in a buildup of mail-filed cases that are now being manually entered, adding pressure to an already strained system.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/News-Digest-Header-1.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:01:54.914305

He had just published a roughly 20-minute video drawn from footage he had filmed in China's Xinjiang region where people were reportedly being detained.

Guan believed the film would lead to his arrest in China, so he hoped to reach the U.S. and ask for asylum. Battling severe seasickness and despite having no prior boating experience, he reached the shores of Florida 23 hours later, he later told Human Rights in China, a U.S.-based advocacy group, which has been raising awareness about Guan's case.

This week, after months of being held in U.S. immigration detention in upstate New York, the 38-year-old appeared via a video link before an immigration court in upstate New York on his asylum application. His asylum case is still pending.

If asylum is denied, he could face deportation to Uganda, which a Department of Homeland Security lawyer argued in favor of during a Monday hearing on Guan's case. Such third-country deportations, in which people are removed to countries where they are not from, were cleared by the Supreme Court in July. A second hearing for Guan is scheduled for Jan. 12.

The story of Guan's desperate escape to the United States, only to end up in detention, raises fresh questions over the scope of an expanding immigration crackdown in the U.S.

""He has a pending asylum application, and the circumstances of his departure from the PRC are a textbook example of why asylum exists,"" Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote in a letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday.

The Department of Homeland Security said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had ""encountered"" Guan while carrying out a criminal search warrant, in a statement sent to NPR. ""This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time. All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.""

In 2020, Guan had become intrigued from English news reports about China's extrajudicial detention of at least hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region, according to his mother and lawyer.

He decided to go to the region and film hours of footage of purported detention camps and evidence of the massive securitization of the region.

He did not dare publish the footage while still in China, so in July 2021, he left China and flew to Ecuador, which Chinese nationals could then enter visa-free, then to the Bahamas, where he bought the small inflatable boat he sailed to the U.S., according to his lawyer, Chen Chuangchuang.

About 15% of asylum applications from Chinese nationals adjudicated in 2024 were rejected, compared to more than 50% that were granted.

In the U.S., Guan applied for asylum and secured a work permit. He made ends meet driving Uber and doing odd jobs.

But this past August, Guan was arrested by ICE who raided his residence initially to investigate his roommate, his lawyer said.

""How Guan ended up being caught by ICE was really due to bad luck,"" said Chen, his lawyer.

His case has attracted criticism from human rights activists, who argue the U.S. must protect Guan as a whistleblower.

His family back in China says they were interrogated extensively after Guan left the country and published his Xinjiang footage.

""There is not one family member of his who has been left unaffected and not investigated,"" his mother, Luo Yun, who lives in Taiwan, told NPR.

Taken together, these developments mark a period in which long-standing boundaries between civilian and military authority are being reconsidered.","Across the country, the United States is experiencing a shift that is unusual in its modern history. Although there is a long-standing norm against military involvement in civilian affairs, multiple kinds of military forces are increasingly entering roles traditionally carried out by civilian agencies. This now includes National Guard units, federally trained military personnel embedded in joint task forces, and Department of Defense (DOD)–supported operations appearing in everyday public safety contexts, often alongside federal enforcement partners such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), or U.S. Marshals participating in coordinated operations. These developments respond directly to the president’s call for a greater domestic military presence.

Notably, these roles are no longer confined to large-scale emergencies. Military personnel, who historically would be activated only for major disasters, are now participating in immigration enforcement operations, municipal policing activities, transit-hub monitoring, and other civilian spaces. The recent events in Memphis, Tennessee, provide the clearest example, though they are far from the only one. At the same time, federal policymakers are revisiting the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century statute, and exploring how it might be used inside the United States today.

Viewed together, these trends reflect a moment of genuine transformation. The United States is testing how far military participation in civilian life can extend, and that is not something we see often. This article explains what is happening, why it matters, and how these developments reflect a broader shift in the relationship between civilian and military authority.

The Memphis Deployment: A Case Study in Expanding Military Power

The recent deployment in Memphis illustrates how quickly military involvement in civilian contexts can escalate. In September 2025, after the federal government created a multi-agency public safety task force for the city, it requested military support from Tennessee. Governor Bill Lee activated the Tennessee National Guard under Title 32, which kept the Guard under nominal state control while integrating its personnel into a federally coordinated operation.1 Guard members were deputized as special federal officers and began participating in civil enforcement activities throughout Memphis.

Local and state officials immediately objected. They argued that the deployment violated both the Tennessee Constitution and the Tennessee Military Code. Under state law, the governor may activate the militia only during rebellion or invasion, and only when the General Assembly has determined that public safety requires it. None of those conditions existed. Memphis and Shelby County had also never requested assistance, even though state law requires a local request before the Guard can be used in this manner.

On Nov. 17, 2025, the Davidson County Chancery Court issued a temporary injunction halting the deployment. The court found no evidence of rebellion, invasion, or emergency conditions that would justify activation. Importantly, it also rejected the argument that the dispute was a non-justiciable political question.2 Because court intervention in National Guard deployments is rare, particularly those connected to federal initiatives, the ruling is significant.

The Memphis case now serves as a concrete example of the friction that emerges when federal authorities seek military involvement in local settings that state law does not support. It highlights how quickly federal strategy, state authority, and military power can collide and shows how easily these conflicts can reshape enforcement practices on the ground.

Title 32: A Federal Workaround With Expanding Domestic Use

Title 32 has quietly become one of the most consequential tools for bringing military personnel into civilian realms. It operates in a legal gray area where state authority and federal direction overlap. Under Title 32, National Guard members remain state personnel on paper but carry out missions shaped by federal priorities. As a result, they fall outside the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the federal government from using the Army or Air Force to carry out civilian law enforcement activities unless authorized by Congress.3 This makes Title 32 a powerful doorway through which the military can enter spaces where federal troops would normally be prohibited.

The Supreme Court emphasized this unusual flexibility in Perpich v. Department of Defense.4 The Court explained that the Guard does not serve a single sovereign: it can function as a state militia, as a Federal Reserve component, or as a fully federalized force. This fluidity is precisely what makes the Guard attractive when the federal government wants military participation without the legal constraints that normally limit military involvement in civil affairs.

Memphis demonstrates what happens when that flexibility is stretched to its limits. A federal request, a rapid state activation, and the Guard suddenly appeared inside a city’s public safety operations, despite the absence of the conditions required by Tennessee law. The court stopped the deployment, but the underlying tension remains. Title 32 now sits at the center of a larger question: How far can the federal government reach into local communities through a military force that is state-controlled only in name? And what happens when a statute designed for cooperative support becomes a mechanism for expanding state and federal power into spaces historically reserved for civilians?

The Alien Enemies Act and Why It Matters Now

The Alien Enemies Act (AEA) is among the oldest immigration-related statutes still in effect.5 The AEA gives the federal government broad wartime authority to detain, restrict, or remove noncitizens based solely on nationality whenever the United States is engaged in a declared conflict. Originally enacted in 1798 as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts, the AEA is the only component of that package that remains active today. The Supreme Court upheld this sweeping authority in Ludecke v. Watkins6, deferring heavily to executive judgment in wartime.

Despite its age, the AEA continues to surface in contemporary enforcement debates. Recent litigation, including WMM v. Trump7, demonstrates how quickly the statute can be revived and adapted to new domestic contexts, even without a formal declaration of war. Reporting on the administration’s 2025 invocation of the AEA against Venezuelan nationals shows that the statute is no longer confined to traditional wartime contexts but is now appearing in immigration-enforcement and internal-security operations.8

The central concern is that the AEA was written for a very different era yet remains fully available today. Its broad grant of authority raises pressing questions about how far it might reach inside the United States and under what circumstances the executive could invoke it. As federal agencies consider potential modern uses of the AEA, the implications extend beyond doctrine. These choices affect community trust, perceptions of institutional legitimacy, and the practical boundary between national security powers and everyday civil life.

Accountability and Immunity for Military Actors

A central concern in the current enforcement environment is accountability: what happens when military personnel engage in civilian enforcement and something goes wrong? CLINIC Affiliates are already hearing reports from clients describing aggressive tactics, injuries during detentions, masked officers, and enforcement teams where authority lines are unclear. In such circumstances, identifying the responsible actor becomes extremely difficult.

A major contributor to this uncertainty is the overlapping immunities that apply to military-involved enforcement teams. National Guard members activated under Title 32 often retain state sovereign immunity, which shields state personnel from many civil damages claims. When deputized by the federal government, they may also receive federal immunity protections. Military personnel supporting civilian operations operate under additional doctrines that limit when and how they can be sued. These layers stack together to create deep accountability gaps.

Although these doctrines do not prevent courts from issuing injunctions — as the Memphis case illustrates — they significantly restrict the ability of individuals who have already experienced harm to pursue meaningful remedies. Many clients cannot determine whether the person who detained or injured them was acting as a state officer, a federal officer, a military actor, or some combination of the three. Masks, unmarked uniforms, and mixed teams only heighten the confusion.

The expanding presence of federal officers and deputized personnel in civilian environments also introduces broad qualified-immunity protections. Deputized officers operating under federal authority may receive federal immunity that local officers would not. Military personnel working under Title 32 or related structures often benefit from doctrines tied to their military status. As these categories blend together in joint operations, the accountability framework becomes nearly impossible for the public to navigate.

This is why Memphis matters: it exposed how quickly federal direction, state activation, and blurred military roles can collide, leaving communities without transparency or clear avenues for redress. The court’s injunction turned on basic structural problems, including the absence of statutory authority for activation under Tennessee law, the lack of any local request for assistance, and no identified emergency that would justify deploying the Guard. Yet the deployment had already placed National Guard members inside civilian public safety operations under federal coordination. In that environment, it becomes difficult for residents to understand which level of government authorized the operation, which agency controls the personnel on the ground, and where complaints or challenges should be directed.

The Growing Domestic Military Footprint

The Memphis deployment is not an isolated event but part of a larger national pattern. Military personnel are increasingly appearing in civilian spaces where they have seldom, if ever, been present. These spaces include courthouses, airports, transportation hubs, shelters, and local public safety operations. In some cities, Guard members or federally trained military support units have become visible inside operations that were previously handled exclusively by civilian agencies. National reporting has documented comparable deployments in cities such as Portland and Chicago, where the presence of mixed federal, state, and military teams has raised serious questions about oversight and accountability.

For immigrant communities, the consequences are profound. A visible military presence in civil enforcement settings undermines feelings of safety, erodes trust in institutions, and discourages people from seeking services or leaving their homes. For individuals who have previously experienced military-driven harm or come from countries where military involvement signals danger, these developments can be especially destabilizing.

More troubling is that these deployments are increasingly untethered from clear emergencies. Instead, they appear in routine public safety and enforcement contexts traditionally reserved for civilian agencies. This suggests a gradual normalization of military participation in domestic affairs, which is occurring without robust public debate about appropriate limits.

Looking Ahead

The Memphis injunction demonstrates that state courts still play a critical role in limiting domestic military involvement. But it also shows how quickly those limits can be tested when federal and state interests converge. Simultaneously, renewed attention to the Alien Enemies Act (a statute written for a radically different era) underscores the extent to which emergency powers are resurfacing in modern internal-enforcement debates.

Nationally, these issues are poised to escalate in WMM v. Trump, which raises foundational questions about the scope of presidential power, the use of wartime authorities in peacetime, and the due-process protections owed when the government targets individuals based solely on nationality. The Fifth Circuit is hearing the case en banc, and the stakes are significant enough that Supreme Court review appears likely. The Court has already intervened once through an emergency stay, and the core questions in the case go to the heart of how far the AEA can reach in contemporary America.

Taken together, these developments mark a period in which long-standing boundaries between civilian and military authority are being reconsidered. The rising use of Title 32, the increasing presence of military personnel in civilian spaces, and active litigation over wartime statutes all point toward a broader rethinking of internal enforcement strategy. The outcomes of these cases and policy decisions will shape the next phase of immigration enforcement and determine the role that military power will play inside the country.",https://www.cliniclegal.org/sites/default/files/CLINIC%20favicon.png,N,,2025-12-17 15:58:13.248630

On Dec. 11, the American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), Comitté de 100, Latino Chamber of Commerce of Southeast Wisconsin and other business leaders hosted a press conference at Milwaukee City Hall in downtown Milwaukee. The press conference urged reforms in the immigration system and how it impacts Wisconsin’s already shrinking workforce as it struggles to attract and retain talent in multiple sectors of business.

“Let’s begin by looking at the numbers. In 1960, Wisconsin’s fertility rate was 4.1; in 2020, it had fallen to 1.6. To maintain a population not counting on immigration, you need a fertility rate. We’re far below that threshold,” said Darrly Morin, president and CEO of Advanced Wireless Inc., and Comité de 100 state captain.

While fertility rates have fallen, Morin also noted the state’s unemployment rate of 3.1%. The rate contrasts with the number of available jobs with a 7-to-10 ratio for every 10 positions open, seven unemployed individuals are looking for a job. That translates to more than 32,500 jobs short if every unemployed person in Wisconsin gains employment.

The figures coincide with economic constraints in Wisconsin, Morin said. The state has an ample population of workers, but employers are looking elsewhere, as many without proper work authorization are unable to fill job openings.

“It means employers are competing, not only the companies and organizations from other states, but from other countries where they have more labor available,” Morin said. “It’s time for us to… start implementing solutions.”

Morin cited a November study from Marquette Law School looking at broad public opinion to give work permits to immigrants in the United States legally.

Results show that an overwhelming majority of respondents, both Democrat and Republican, support granting work permits to immigrants who have been in the U.S. legally for at least five years, have jobs and no criminal record.

Data shows 72% in favor — 89% of Democrats and 66% of Republicans. Morin and others urge Congress to take action.

“We have to return to a shared set of principles. One of these must be that the idea of hard work should be encouraged and rewarded“, said Milwaukee Alderman José Perez, D-12. “These aren’t handouts and little things. This is not a government subsidy. We are talking about an honest day’s work for an honest day’s pay.”

Perez highlights how many immigrants are paying into U.S. systems without being able to receive any benefits. The most recent study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy showed that in 2022, undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 billion in federal, state and local taxes.

Immigrants, particularly Latinos, as discussed in the press conference, are an economic driver — but not when they cannot obtain work permits, said Nelson Soler, president and CEO of the Latino Chamber of Commerce of Southeast Wisconsin.

Those without work permits cannot fully participate in the economy. The result leads to an increase in prices and gaps in job availability from slowed growth, Soler said.

“Employers in industries such as construction, hospitality, manufacturing and childcare report persistent workforce shortages,” Soler said. “These shortages slow economic growth and limit the ability of businesses, large and small, to be in demand. Those who have lived in our community for years, including Dreamers and long-term workers, are ready and willing to contribute more fully.”

Hundreds of demonstrators, including faith leaders, blocked entrances and chained themselves to the doors of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday morning to protest President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

The Department of Homeland Security said that 44 people were arrested. A reporter witnessed federal officers restraining a dozen people with zip ties.

The demonstration, which led to the office’s closure for the day, brought together ministers, rabbis, and imams who said they were taking direct action after months of bearing witness outside immigration courthouses where immigrants have been detained during legal proceedings. The protest was organized by a coalition called Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity.

“We’ve had enough of the racist ICE raids that have been going on, abducting people,” said the Rev. Kevin Mann, community minister at First Unitarian Church of Oakland. “In this building, hundreds of people have been abducted in the middle of legal court hearings.”

The 630 Sansome St. location serves as the headquarters for an ICE district that oversees operations from Oregon to Bakersfield, California.

Officers with the United States Federal Protective Service ordered the crowd to disperse at 9:45 a.m.; San Francisco police were stationed nearby, but did not appear to take part in detaining demonstrators. An hour later, there were between 100 and 150 people blocking an entrance to the building, holding signs with messages like “ICE out of CA” and chanting “This Little Light of Mine,” as firefighters used bolt cutters to sever the chains binding protesters together.

Faith leaders said they have maintained a presence outside Bay Area immigration courthouses since July, accompanying individuals to hearings. They said some people entering the buildings for legal proceedings were detained and have not been released.

“People are being abducted during this Christmas season, during this time of Hanukkah,” Mann said. “People should be home with their families and not rotting in some ICE jail detention centers somewhere.”

The Rev. Allison Tanner of Lakeshore Avenue Baptist Church in Oakland said the interfaith group decided to escalate with a confrontational protest.

“After six months, we felt the need to escalate our presence — not just bear witness but interrupt the injustice,” Tanner said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin decried Tuesday’s protest, saying in an emailed statement that “ over 200 rioters obstructed law enforcement outside the ICE processing center in San Francisco, California.”

After San Francisco Fire Department firefighters arrived to cut chains, McLaughlin said the people arrested by ICE and United States Federal Protective Service officers “appear to be U.S. citizens.”

San Francisco has been a flashpoint for immigration protests since the summer.

In June, police arrested roughly 150 people during a demonstration against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Two days later, hundreds of protesters shut down operations at the Sansome Street building. In July, tensions escalated when agents drove a van into a group of protesters outside the immigration court at 100 Montgomery St., continuing down the street for a block as a protester clung to the hood.

In October, tensions across the Bay Area intensified after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy federal agents to the region as part of an immigration enforcement surge. He abruptly canceled the plan after lobbying by tech billionaires and a phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie.

The SFPD said it was not involved in the protest.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_19o4hjc2gl02102komuovhco48/-C100.00%25x69.73%25%2C0.00%25%2C7.10%25-FWEBP,N,,2025-12-17 13:58:09.235917

to conceive, sponsored the proposal and harshly criticized its omission from the final bill.
Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees said the legislation contained the largest overhaul of military acquisition in decades.","The Senate on Wednesday gave final approval to a $900 billion defense policy bill, clearing legislation that advances the bulk of President Trump’s national security agenda and modernizes the way the U.S. military buys weapons and supplies, while also seeking to reassert congressional oversight of military operations.

The 77-to-20 vote reflected bipartisan support in Congress to continue to spend robustly on defense, including on new submarines, fighter jets and drone technology. The bill also includes a pay raise of 3.8 percent for military personnel.

While the Trump administration has made steep cuts to the federal government over the past year, the price tag on the bill was $8 billion above what the White House had requested for the Pentagon for the next year. Still, Mr. Trump is expected to sign the bill into law in the coming days.

The measure puts bipartisan pressure on the Pentagon to be more transparent with Congress about the boat strikes the Trump administration has carried out in international waters; officials have said, without offering public evidence, they are targeting people trafficking narcotics to the United States. The legislative provision would mandate the release of the specific orders behind the strikes and unedited videos of the attacks to lawmakers, and withhold 25 percent of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s travel budget if the administration does not comply.

The bill would also block the Trump administration from withdrawing U.S. troops from Europe, after a recent decision to reduce the Pentagon’s footprint in Germany, Romania and Poland drew ire from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Specifically, the bill prohibits Mr. Hegseth from reducing the number of troops “permanently stationed in or deployed” to Europe below 76,000 for longer than 45 days, unless the Pentagon first consults NATO allies and certifies to Congress that such a drawdown would not put U.S. national security at risk.

The legislation also overcame resistance from hard-right Republicans, who have long criticized funding the defense of foreign allies, and authorizes another $800 million in military aid for Ukraine, as well as millions more for Israel, Taiwan, Iraq and other allies.

The bill does not rename the Department of Defense the Department of War, the preferred moniker of the Trump administration.

Republicans in Congress included several changes, however, aimed at reversing Biden-era policies at the Pentagon, including a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion programs and funding cuts for climate-related programs. An attempt by House Republicans to bar the Defense Department from covering gender-transition surgeries for troops did not ultimately make it into the measure.

Also removed in final negotiations was a provision that would have covered in vitro fertilization treatments for service members struggling with infertility. Democrats had hoped Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to make I.V.F. more accessible would draw Republican backing for the change, but conservatives led by Speaker Mike Johnson killed it for the second year in a row.

Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois and a veteran who relied on I.V.F. to conceive, sponsored the proposal and harshly criticized its omission from the final bill.

“Republicans repeatedly make promises to the public that they support I.V.F., but their extreme actions tell a different story from their lip service during election years,” she said in a statement.

Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees said the legislation contained the largest overhaul of military acquisition in decades. It aims to streamline the delivery of weapons and supplies to troops, in part by reducing regulations on military purchasing.

“We’re about to pass, and the president will enthusiastically sign the most sweeping upgrades to D.O.D.’s business practices in 60 years,” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Wednesday. “This is a monumental achievement.”

The bill repeals authorizations for the use of military force that date back to the Iraq and Persian Gulf wars. Democrats and Republicans have called for years to end the 2002 and 1991 authorizations, frustrated by presidents of both parties relying on them to greenlight all manner of military operations since.

It also ends sweeping sanctions on Syria. Since the fall of former president Bashar al-Assad, lawmakers in both parties have supported lifting the sanctions to promote Syria’s economic recovery from more than a decade of civil war.

A much-criticized section of the final measure permits military aircraft to fly in the airspace around Ronald Reagan National Airport outside Washington with their enhanced tracking software turned off during national security missions, or if the Pentagon determines the flight does not pose a risk to commercial planes.

Senators Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, sought to strike the provision, warning that allowing military aircraft to fly undetected creates dangerous conditions that led to the midair collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and a commercial jet in January.

Local officials disagree. - KNSI,Beth Schwartzapfel for The Marshall Project,,,,,https://knsiradio.com/2025/12/17/trump-says-federal-deployments-make-cities-safer-local-officials-disagree/,"In response, Trump sent 500 National Guard soldiers to the area, but a judge blocked their deployment to the city.
In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.
When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.
Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said.
“If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard, because we’re going to have safe cities.”","These concerns are noted repeatedly in interviews with policing experts and community members, and in lawsuits challenging troop deployments in several American cities, including Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Memphis, Tennessee.

In Chicago, ICE agents began using increasingly aggressive tactics in September during what President Donald Trump dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” It was a response, ICE said, to crimes committed by migrants in Illinois without documentation. The scenes have been dramatic by design: an overnight raid on an apartment building, with Blackhawk helicopters and U.S. citizens dragged into the street in zip-ties. The tactics have resulted in at least one death: In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González while attempting to pull him over and arrest him.

Locals in Chicago have turned out in force to protest, leading to daily demonstrations at an ICE processing center outside Chicago and elsewhere throughout the city. In response, Trump sent 500 National Guard soldiers to the area, but a judge blocked their deployment to the city.

Nevertheless, the presence of immigration agents in the city — with their military-style uniforms and tactics — has made it harder, prosecutors argue in a federal lawsuit, to pursue cases against people accused of violent crimes in Chicago.

In one case, the wife of a man who had been murdered did not want to come to court to testify for fear of being arrested by Homeland Security agents. Her fear of arrest “makes it more likely that her husband’s murderers will go free and justice will be denied,” wrote Jose Villarreal, a prosecutor with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, in court documents.

Villarreal listed a wide array of crimes that his office can no longer prosecute because of ICE’s presence in the city: children who are victims of sexual assault, whose mothers fear that bringing them to court might lead to their arrest by immigration agents; domestic violence cases where victims fear testifying because of immigration agents stationed at the courthouse, meaning “the predators who victimized them may walk free.”

Amid the Trump administration’s insistence that its immigration enforcement is meant to ensure law and order, Villarreal argued that Homeland Security’s actions in and around courthouses in Chicago have made it harder “to protect the victims of violent crime and uphold the law through criminal prosecution.” A spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office declined a request to interview Villarreal, citing the pending litigation.

Calls to 911 have dropped precipitously in the city since the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Chicago Tribune reported, especially in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village. “They don’t really want to call the police because they associate the police with ICE,” Dolores Castañeda, a community activist, told the Tribune. As a result, residents “are feeling more unsafe than ever before.”

After the Trump administration began to flood Memphis with both National Guardsmen and other federal law enforcement agents in October, residents said that traffic stops by officers armed with assault rifles dressed in military garb made them feel less safe. “It makes everyone feel like a criminal. So you just literally criminalize the whole of Memphis,” said Keedran Franklin, a community organizer there.

In Memphis, where local police have struggled to build trust with communities of color — under the Biden administration, the Memphis Police Department was under investigation for using excessive force and racially profiling Black and brown residents — local police officers have been working side-by-side with the federal agents, doing traffic stops and executing warrants. In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.

“That’s only made the relationship even more strained,” said Amber Sherman, a community activist and a member of a police reform task force in the city. “And I didn’t think there was a chance of repair anyways, but I definitely don’t think there is one now. Just because of the level of trauma that’s being inflicted every single day.” The Memphis Police Department did not respond to a request to comment on Sherman’s concerns.

The playbook in Memphis was different from the other cities, because unlike governors in California and Illinois, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, supported the move. Several hundred federal law enforcement officers — from the National Guard and a wide range of other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — arrived to participate in an action the government called “Memphis Safe Task Force.” But the county’s Democratic mayor, Lee Harris, has since sued the governor and others. The enormous influx of troops led to over 1,000 arrests, and local jails do not have the capacity to hold that many people. Weeks after the task force began operating, Harris declared a state of emergency to deal with overcrowding in the jails. By the end of October, troops were still there and had made hundreds of additional arrests.

In Los Angeles, where the Trump administration began deploying troops in June, Trump said that the aim was to protect federal employees and property from protesters who objected to ICE’s aggressive tactics when they descended on the city in tactical gear, conducting large-scale workplace raids. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials sued the Trump administration, arguing that military presence would “only escalate tensions” and “erode public trust.”

Their warnings were prescient. When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.

“Soldiers patrolling the streets of Los Angeles have not made anyone safer; indeed, the opposite is true,” according to court filings in California’s lawsuit to end the National Guard deployment. The Trump administration’s “confrontational decision to deploy the military in a civilian city serves only to spread fear and heighten tensions in Los Angeles. If anything, the presence of the military threatens to further destabilize the community and escalate a situation that calls for cool heads and steady hands.” About 100 troops remain stationed there, according to military officials.

In interviews with The Marshall Project and in court documents, police experts argue that National Guard troops and other militarized federal law enforcement make it harder for police to keep cities safe. “For some chiefs, this is their worst nightmare,” said Christy Lopez, a Georgetown Law professor who oversaw Constitutional policing enforcement at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. “They’ve been working with communities for years — decades — building trust with immigrant communities, marginalized communities. All it takes is one raid to destroy years of goodwill,” she said.

That’s because modern-day policing depends on trust. To prevent and solve crimes, police need community members to call them in emergencies and to cooperate in investigations — actions the public won’t take if they don’t trust that their concerns will be taken seriously. “True public safety is only possible when the community believes that their police department exists to serve them with fairness, equity, and respect,” wrote U. Renee Hall, former Dallas police chief, in a declaration filed in the Washington D.C., litigation, which began in early September, weeks after troops began patrolling the city with fatigues and armored vehicles.

Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said. “It’s all just people with guns who can tell you what to do.” Federal agents often wear tactical vests that say “POLICE” — although technically they are not — which further confuses people, said Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police officer. “I don’t want the line blurred, because I don’t want ICE giving a bad name to police departments.”

Since the end of the Civil War, the idea that the military should not intervene in the country’s civil government — except in emergencies — has been enshrined in both law and our national values. A handful of such emergencies took place during the civil rights movement, when the federal government sent the National Guard to Southern states to assist with desegregating schools, at times over segregationist governors’ objections. The last time the National Guard was called into an American city was in 1992, when California’s governor requested assistance in Los Angeles amid riots after the acquittal of the White police officers caught on videotape beating Rodney King.

But certainly the most infamous example of the National Guard being used to quell protests was at Kent State University in 1970. Amid escalating demonstrations against the Vietnam War, including a building on campus set ablaze, the mayor of Kent, Ohio, asked the state’s governor to send in troops. Shortly after arriving on campus, soldiers opened fire on a crowd, killing four college students.

In October, federal circuit court Judge Ronald M. Gould warned in a written dissent that “to have an armed military faced off against civilian protesters, whatever the motivation of the President, threatens to produce another tragedy, such as that occurring at Kent State University in 1970.” A majority of his colleagues on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Trump to continue with troop deployments in Los Angeles.

And this trend may yet continue. A Pentagon memo drafted in October outlined plans to train tens of thousands of National Guard troops across all 50 states to respond to civil unrest and be ready to deploy to American cities. And last week, speaking on an aircraft carrier near Tokyo. Trump told U.S. troops that deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities was just the beginning of his plans for dealing with crime. “If we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard, because we’re going to have safe cities.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/uploads/station/2095/fbShare.png?r=57652,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:29.228038

Community journalists are also more siloed, isolated, and less visible than ever before.","It is no secret that both immigrants and journalists are under attack. Immigrant journalists face the double threat of trying to stay safe while running headlong into unsafe situations in order to do their jobs, and increasingly, a press pass or vest does little to prevent direct attacks or even arrest. However dangerous the circumstances are for all immigrant journalists, nowhere is the threat higher than for immigrant or exiled journalists working in in-language and community-based news media — a message heard loud and clear with the arrest and deportation of immigrant community journalist Mario Guevara.

Whether they are working at legacy ethnic press, or reporting for the hundreds of digital news outlets serving hyperlocal immigrant audiences, or operating in exile, immigrant journalists working in U.S. community media today must navigate a tightening grip on their First Amendment rights, immigration status, and personal safety — often from within the U.S. as well as overseas, and increasingly from within their own communities.

Over the course of the last year, the Asian Media Initiative at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism’s Center for Community Media worked with a group of immigrant and exiled journalists working in in-language and community-centered media serving Afghan American, Arab American, Bangladeshi American, Chinese-speaking, Indian American, and Indonesian American community journalists across the U.S. Many struggled not only to keep themselves safe, but also their predominantly immigrant reporting staff, as well as the undocumented and otherwise vulnerable immigrant audiences they served.

The journalists we worked with were on student visas, came from homelands at war or experiencing anti-democratic crackdowns, and lived in communities that were being targeted by immigration enforcement operations. Some of the print outlets’ most reliable advertisers were being influenced by extremist movements, powerful corporations, or state governments from abroad, as well as rising pressures from tariffs. All digital outlets were navigating transnational repression, surveillance from within the U.S., as well as escalating digital harassment and doxxing.

Like all community media led by and serving Black, Latino, AAPI, Indigenous, and LGBTQ audiences, these news outlets are understaffed and underresourced, often off the radar of major advertisers and news philanthropy. Sometimes, their efforts to cut costs can expose them to authoritarian tactics from overseas, such as Internet shutdowns commonly used as a tool of repression across South and Southeast cutting immigrant neighborhoods off from news during student uprisings in Nepal or Bangladesh, or amid military operations in Kashmir. Authoritarian regimes are taking notice of immigrant media — one Chinese-language journalist told me that a representative of state media routinely wrote down the names of publishers picking up their print editions from a local printer, and just a few months ago, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan made it illegal for local residents to “collaborate” with exiled media covering their circumstances for their refugee and diaspora news audiences.

In other instances, their efforts to engage their audiences on social media or messaging platforms can enable overseas governments to censor their work, ideological groups to organize harassment campaigns, so-called self-media to steal and modify their work, or invite vicious trolls and cybertroops. And in increasingly ideologically divided communities, small community-based newsrooms can find themselves facing threats, retaliation, intimidation, boycotts, and quid pro quo coverage demands from within their own communities.

Immigrant journalists tell me that they have resorted to a range of different tactics to protect themselves, their immigrant staffers, and their audiences from violent immigration enforcement. Some have their staffers on visas withhold bylines or pivot to desktop reporting rather than attend protests or attempt to cover enforcement operations. Others send volunteers with burner phones pre-loaded with immigration attorney contact information to accompany reporters. In a recent report on LGBTQ media, we are seeing these tactics employed by other vulnerable community media journalists.

In the nineteenth century, when ethnic press emerged alongside popular news media, the Black press served as the beacon for how journalism could advance multiracial democracy, advocating against Asian exclusion, hiring immigrant journalists who couldn’t find work in white-led media, and platforming LGBTQ writers.

Today, the so-called community media landscape is larger, more robust, and expanding faster than ever before, ranging from legacy ethnic newspapers to glossy magazines to podcasts and multimedia platforms to investigative and human rights documenting projects from journalists in exile. Community journalists are also more siloed, isolated, and less visible than ever before. If we believe that journalism can and should advance multiracial democracy, even at this moment when its future in the U.S. seems fragile and threatened, we must invest in immigrant-led media, and build strong networks that enable immigrant, LGBTQ, Black, and Indigenous journalists to share strategies, pool resources, collaborate on their reporting, and help keep each other safe.",https://www.niemanlab.org/images/Kavitha-Rajagopalan.jpeg,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:06.584123

At least half a dozen providers have sued the state Department of Human Services in recent months over suspended payments, which they say have either shut down their businesses or put them at existential risk, harming the clients who depend on their services.

One lawsuit filed in August in district court was dismissed in early December. In another suit in October, a personal care assistant filed suit and DHS resumed Medicaid payments a week later.

A lawsuit from a provider against DHS from September is ongoing, and three additional lawsuits were filed just last week.

The litigation is yet another fallout from the Walz administration’s focus on rooting out fraud in public programs after years of inaction, beginning with the now-notorious Feeding Our Future case that led to more than 75 federal charges and has since morphed into a wide-ranging Medicaid fraud investigation.

The stakes are significant: Successful litigation could encourage more providers to sue, which would complicate the administration’s efforts to thwart the burgeoning fraud scandal — and with it, Gov. Tim Walz’s 2026 reelection efforts.

Provider lawsuit dismissed by district court

A district court dismissed a lawsuit from Empathy Home Care in August in which the provider alleged that DHS stopped payments for its assisted living services starting in May but offered no evidence of fraud.

Michael Schwartz, Empathy Home Care’s attorney, said that “the state’s response to allegations of widespread fraud is being dealt with by just shutting payments off to a whole blanket of people, including Empathy, who’ve done nothing wrong.”

According to a court memo from the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office, evidence gathered by DHS indicated that Empathy Home Care billed for services that it didn’t provide. The memo also said that DHS had evidence that Medicaid recipients went missing when services were supposed to be provided and overdosed without staff attempting to save them.

Much of Empathy’s legal argument rests on a new section in Minnesota statute that limits payment stoppages from all state agencies to 60 days if there’s evidence of fraud. But an older Minnesota statute, which applies specifically to Medicaid-funded services, allows DHS to impose sanctions on Medicaid providers until “the commissioner determines there is insufficient evidence of fraud by the individual or entity, or after legal proceedings relating to the alleged fraud are completed.”

The Minnesota 4th District Court ruled in early December that the older statute is in force, allowing DHS to continue to withhold payment beyond the 60 days allowed in the new statute. Historically, under the older statute, state and federal courts have not allowed Medicaid program providers the right to appeal payment sanctions.

Schwartz said that Empathy plans to appeal the court’s decision this week.

Integrated Community Supports provider sues

The three providers that filed lawsuits against DHS last week range in what services they provide and why DHS suspended their payments.

Bright Community Services says it helps more than 30 adults through Integrated Community Support services, a program that has been under scrutiny by DHS. The program started in 2021 and is designed to help disabled adults live more independently in apartments rather than in an institution.

Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS paused payments for some ICS providers starting in September and implementing a prepayment auditing process this month for 14 programs, including ICS.

DHS has withheld payments to 17 ICS providers as of late November. Bright Community Services was one of them — but, like Empathy Home Care, the business alleges that DHS suspended its payments without explanation. It also said that it asked DHS “on numerous occasions” for further explanation of the fraud allegation but received no response.

Bright Community Services has stopped offering services because it’s now unable to pay staff, according to the lawsuit. DHS has said that providers are still allowed to continue providing services while they stop payments.

“No business can reasonably be expected to do that,” reads the lawsuit from Bright Community Services.

A DHS spokesperson confirmed in a statement that all payments to Bright Community Services were suspended based on “credible allegations of fraud,” which have also been referred to law enforcement. The statement also said that payments may resume if the provider submits sufficient information to demonstrate that there was no fraud.

Lataa Elemo, who operates Bright Community Services, declined an interview request. So far, no providers have faced state or federal charges for defrauding ICS.

DHS investigating connections between different providers

DHS is also investigating and pausing payments for providers affiliated with other providers suspected of fraud.

Two Medicaid program providers partly owned by the same person, Suleiman Isse — Joy Home Healthcare and Hennepin Autism Center — filed a lawsuit against DHS in September over payments halted in June.

DHS said in a notice that it suspended payments to Hennepin Autism in part because it had evidence that the autism center participated in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme, which the autism center denied. DHS additionally suspended payments to Joy Home Healthcare because of its shared ownership with Hennepin Autism.

That lawsuit is ongoing. The attorney representing the providers declined to comment.

Another provider, Agape Home Care Services, received a notice from DHS in September that the business was cut off from payments because of its affiliation with another provider under investigation for fraud, Healthy Living Home Care, according to another recent lawsuit.

Agape doesn’t provide ICS services but does provide other home- and community-based services, as well as nursing services, that are also paid through state-run Medicaid programs.

Michael Hunter, the co-owner of Agape, said that he owns 30% of Healthy Living Home Care but plays no part in the business operations of Healthy Living.

“Because someone has a stake in another company, you put another whole company on payment hold,” Hunter said. “We are not being accused of any wrongdoing, nothing like that.”

Since the payment hold started, Agape has had to stop providing services to all of its clients, Hunter said. The organization usually has 10 to 15 clients, many of whom have intense behavioral and medical needs and were sent to the hospital once services stopped, he said.

Hunter said that Healthy Living Home Care is still waiting to hear why their payments are being withheld. According to Hunter, DHS surveyed Healthy Living but “there was nothing on fraud” in the survey.

DHS and government officials have provided limited information, citing active investigations.

“Hopefully it’s understandable that we don’t want to be too forthcoming about what kinds of actions cause investigators to suspect someone is billing for services they didn’t provide, but in general we look for patterns of concern,” said a DHS spokesperson, in an email.

As in Empathy’s case, Agape’s lawsuit and another lawsuit recently filed by Benevolence LLC, an autism services provider, make the case that DHS can only stop payments for 60 days under the new statute.

A representative from Benevolence LLC declined to comment.

Federal investigators have charged one person for defrauding the autism program. The investigation emerged out of the Feeding Our Future investigation; state spending on autism services exploded by 3,000% in recent years.

Suing the state has been a successful strategy in the past

In yet another lawsuit, a personal care assistant alleged in October that her payments for taking care of her disabled son were suspended two years ago, and that she wasn’t given information or a timeline on DHS’s fraud investigation.

Joseph Dixon, the attorney for the personal care assistant, said that DHS “simply withdrew the payment suspension” rather than respond to the lawsuit, making the case moot.

Feeding Our Future, the nonprofit at the center of a $250 million scheme defrauding the federal government of pandemic money intended to feed children, filed a lawsuit in 2020 against the Minnesota Department of Education when the agency stopped processing applications for new meal sites. Feeding Our Future accused the agency of discriminating on the basis of race, national origin and religion.

Though the judge hearing the case never issued a written order for the Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future, he did say the state did not have authority to stop payments, according to a transcript of a 2021 hearing reviewed by the Star Tribune. Though stopped payments were outside of the purview of the lawsuit, which centered on meal site applications, MDE resumed payments six days later.

In 2022, MDE said in a statement that “the court made it clear that if MDE were to continue the legal fight to withhold payments, MDE would incur sanctions and legal penalties.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091725-photo-fraud-committee-mj-1024x6841765988255.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=8cXWm9bL,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:33.616533

The findings come from Prison Policy Initiative, a national nonprofit that studies mass incarceration in the United States.

Researchers found that agreements between ICE and local law enforcement have become an essential part of increased deportation efforts under the Trump administration. The collaborations allow state police, troopers and corrections officers to act as local arms of the national immigration enforcement agency, carrying out arrests at a growing rate.

In Oklahoma, that means arrests at local jails and lock-ups accounted for half of the 2,323 people arrested for immigration charges in the state between May 21 and October 15.

People who have already been booked into custody by local law enforcement are being flagged for immigration charges at facilities collaborating with ICE.

But researchers say large numbers of ICE arrests at local jails are not an indication that immigrants and asylum seekers are more likely to be arrested for a crime. Robust data from Texas, for example, showed that undocumented immigrants had much lower arrest rates than U.S.-born citizens. Instead, in too many cases, a traffic stop can mean deportation, the report says.

The 1,176 people arrested on immigration charges in Oklahoma jails recently could have entered custody for any number of reasons.

In general, most people in jails have not been convicted of a crime. Over 80% of people in jails have not been convicted and are legally presumed innocent. Most are held for low-level offenses like loitering and public intoxication, not violent crimes.

In Oklahoma, ICE has also started relying on local jails and shuttered prisons to hold people with immigration cases.

Agreements with local law enforcement can take many forms. As of August, 18 local law enforcement agencies had signed 287(g) contracts, allowing them to interrogate and arrest people for federal immigration violations, and then hold them for deportation processing.

ICYMI: Senator Murray Condemns Egregious Use of Force by ICE as Constituent is Mauled by Attack Dog, Demands Release from NWIPC to Receive Appropriate Medical Care

***LETTER HERE***

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, led Members of the Washington state Congressional delegation in a letter to Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Todd Lyons, expressing grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington and demanding answers to a long list of questions regarding overcrowding and lack of access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for individuals detained at the facility. The population at NWIPC has ballooned over the past year under the Trump administration’s indiscriminate and cruel mass deportation campaign, nearing—and at times exceeding—the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575.

Joining Senator Murray in sending the letter to ICE were: Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and U.S. Representatives Suzan DelBene (D, WA-01), Rick Larsen (D, WA-02), Emily Randall (D, WA-06), Pramila Jayapal (D, WA-07), Kim Schrier (D, WA-08), Adam Smith (D, WA-09), and Marilyn Strickland (D, WA-10).

“Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility,” the Members wrote in their letter. “In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity. None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.”

“It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities,” the lawmakers continued. “With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.”

In the letter, the Members raise concern over the lack of medical care for individuals detained at NWIPC and other ICE facilities, writing: “We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens. Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care.”

Recently, Senator Murray called attention to the violent assault of Wilmer Toledo-Martinez in Vancouver, Washington—condemning the officers who sicced an attack dog on Wilmer, despite him not resisting arrest, and calling for Wilmer to be immediately released from ICE custody. Wilmer is currently being held at NWIPC, where he has been unable to obtain adequate medical care. In a visit to NWIPC by Senator Murray’s staff in August, facility staff indicated that NWIPC only employed four behavioral health staffers for a population of approximately 1,500 detainees. There were reports of at least two suicide attempts at NWIPC in April. In July 2024, after the death of a man detained at NWIPC, Senator Murray requested a comprehensive review of the quality and accessibility of medical services for individuals in ICE custody from the Government Accountability Office (GAO)—that review is currently underway.

The lawmakers’ letter also draws attention to reports from advocates that at least three pregnant women detained at NWIPC over the past year have been unable to receive appropriate medical care. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility. Senator Murray has long fought against the mistreatment of pregnant women in detention, including by pushing for her legislation—the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act—to end the practice of shackling pregnant women in ICE detention. Murray also led an oversight letter to ICE in September demanding answers and accountability about the mistreatment of pregnant women in detention facilities under the Trump administration.

The Members continued by raising concerns over the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC and difficulty that detained individuals have in accessing legal counsel, writing: “Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients.”

The letter concludes by requesting answers to a list of questions by January 16th regarding capacity and staffing levels at NWIPC, the provision of food and medical care, access to legal counsel, treatment of pregnant women, and recent facility visits. “Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility,” the Members wrote. “We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect. Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.”

Senator Murray and other members of Washington state’s Congressional delegation have been conducting oversight of NWIPC throughout this year, despite the Trump administration’s efforts to block Congressional oversight of federal immigration detention facilities. After a protracted legal battle over Washington state’s ability to enforce health and safety standards at NWIPC, a federal appeals court ruled in August that the state should be allowed to enforce such standards at the detention center, and that failure to comply could result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation.

Senator Murray has championed comprehensive and humane immigration reform throughout her time in Congress, and has consistently pushed for greater oversight of conditions at NWIPC. In 2024 at a Senate Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing, Murray asked then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to commit to an independent investigation of conditions at NWIPC and pressed him on the overuse of solitary confinement at ICE detention facilities—which Senator Murray has consistently spoken out against. While Chair of Appropriations, Senator Murray secured language in the Homeland Security Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024—which was signed into law in March 2024—to ensure stronger oversight of federal detention facilities and provisions to increase transparency. Senator Murray is also an original cosponsor of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, which would set humane standards for detention facilities and increase oversight. Murray was outspoken in her opposition to the Laken Riley Act earlier this year, arguing it threatened civil liberties and would divert resources away from detaining true threats to public safety.

The lawmakers’ full letter to ICE is available HERE and below:

Dear Acting Director Lyons:

We are writing to share our grave concerns with conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, Washington and to request information about access to medical services, food, and legal counsel for detained noncitizens at the facility. Our offices have received reports from local service providers and advocates that conditions and access to services at NWIPC have deteriorated in the last year as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has chosen to detain more individuals at the facility. In June, detained individuals were reportedly transferred to Alaska—far away from their families and legal representatives—because NWIPC reached capacity.

None of this is remotely acceptable—you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care.

You must ensure the facility complies with the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards as revised in 2016 (PBNDS 2011) to keep detained noncitizens safe and healthy while protecting the rights they are entitled to under law.

It is well established at this point that this administration is not prioritizing detaining violent criminals, but instead is detaining mostly peaceful, law-abiding immigrants with no criminal record who work hard and contribute to our communities. With this in mind, we urge ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety and to ensure necessary staff levels at NWIPC to protect the safety and basic dignity of the people in its custody.

Medical Care

The federal government has a moral and legal obligation to protect the health of individuals in its custody. We have had long-standing concerns about access to medical services in ICE detention facilities. In recent years, several members of the Washington Congressional delegation requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a comprehensive review of the quality and accessibility of medical services for individuals in ICE custody. At times this year, NWIPC has exceeded 1,500 individuals in custody, nearing the facility’s maximum capacity of 1,575 individuals. We are deeply concerned that the facility does not have sufficient medical staff and dedicated space to adequately provide medical care to the increased number of detained noncitizens.

Additionally, we are incredibly concerned about challenges detainees face in accessing behavioral health care and other specialty care. During an August 2025 site visit, facility staff indicated the facility employed only four behavioral health staffers. There were reports of at least two suicide attempts at NWIPC in April. It is plainly inadequate to have four behavioral health staff serving the 1,500 detainees under the facility’s care, especially given the fact that serious behavioral health issues frequently emerge under the severe stress of detention. We are also alarmed by reports from advocates with access to the facility that at least three detained pregnant women at NWIPC have been unable to receive appropriate medical care, even after they request specialty prenatal care appointments. Regular exams such as ultrasounds are necessary to monitor development and ensure a healthy pregnancy. Advocates also shared that at least one pregnant woman was shackled during transportation, which violates agency policy and raises concerns that medical information, such as whether a woman is pregnant, is not being properly documented by the facility.

Food

The Seattle Times recently reported on the inadequate provision of meals at NWIPC as the detained population has increased. Advocates who speak with detainees have shared that meals are provided late and, in some cases, detainees did not receive three meals per day. Detainees have made complaints about food and sanitation for many years, and we urge the facility to be responsive to the nutritional needs of individuals in its custody. Legal service providers with access to the facility have also shared that detainees waiting for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings may miss meals. We urge the facility to ensure that all detained noncitizens, including those awaiting hearings or visits, are provided a minimum of three meals per day, as required by national detention standards (PBNDS 2011).

Access to Legal Counsel

Access to legal resources for noncitizens in immigration detention supports their ability to understand their rights and navigate immigration court, preventing backlogs in the immigration court system. Detained noncitizens at NWIPC face several concerning barriers to accessing legal counsel. Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult. This has become especially challenging when immigration courts advance noncitizens’ hearings by months without sufficient warning. At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients. This August, two of the seven attorney visitation rooms were being used as Virtual Attorney Visitation rooms (VAVs) and two were being used for video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings, leaving only three rooms available for attorneys to meet with their clients in person. We have also heard from advocates with access to the facility that, at times, only one visitation room was available and interviews for facility staff were being conducted in these attorney visitation rooms.

In the Fiscal Year 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress provided $10,000,000 for ICE to improve legal resources for noncitizen detainees, including to expand video attorney visitation. During an August 2025 site visit, NWIPC staff indicated that the facility recently implemented a new scheduling system to reserve attorney visitation rooms. We ask that the facility work with attorneys to resolve any issues that arise with the new system expeditiously so as not to delay access to legal counsel. We urge you to improve access to legal counsel by ensuring attorney visitation rooms remain available for attorneys to meet with their clients.

Given these concerns, we request answers to the following questions by January 16, 2026:

What is the maximum capacity of NWIPC, as determined by the fire marshal? As of November 1, 2025, how many individuals were detained at the facility?

How many staff were employed by NWIPC on January 20, 2025? Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provided direct medical services?

As of November 1, 2025, how many staff were employed by NWIPC? Of this cohort, how many were trained and certified medical services providers who routinely provide direct medical services?

As of November 1, 2025, how many pregnant women were detained at NWIPC? How often have these women requested, and how often have they received, prenatal care appointments with a specialist?

How many days in the last six months has the facility not provided three meals each day to every noncitizen in its custody?

Why did the facility not provide three meals each day to every noncitizen?

For each day, for how many noncitizens were three meals not provided?

What is the current status of the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) at NWIPC? Are noncitizens able to access LOP daily? What are the hours of availability each day? Outside of hours, are there any other restrictions on daily LOP access, and if so, what are they and why are they in place?

How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for in-person attorney meetings? How many attorney visitation rooms are currently available for virtual attorney meetings?

In the last six months, have the attorney visitation rooms been used for a purpose other than attorney-client meetings (in-person or virtual) or video teleconferencing (VTC) hearings?

When were the most recent facility visits by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Office of Inspector General, DHS Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and ICE oversight personnel (whether the Office of Professional Responsibility or otherwise)? What, if any, recommendations were made after each visit? What progress has been made to implement such recommendations?

OIDO issued a report in November 2024 following an inspection of NWIPC. While 11 of the recommendations have been addressed, one remains outstanding. What progress has been made on implementing the remaining recommendation?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Please understand that we are paying close attention to the conditions at NWIPC—and your management of this facility.

We urge you to promptly review these concerns and take immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at NWIPC to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect.

Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged.

Sincerely,

Though work, economic opportunity, and family reunification are the chief reasons that people cross borders, many of the notable trends of 2025 related to humanitarian protection. That in part reflected the rising levels of conflict globally and underscored that many countries remained unsettled on how and to whom to provide asylum.

Yet 2025 was not solely defined by restrictionism or international discord. The number of forcibly displaced individuals declined for the first time in years, the landscape for certain workers diversified, and some regional blocs continued their marches towards greater integration.

1. Foreign Aid Cuts Cripple Humanitarian Efforts and Raise Prospect of New Displacement

Governments across high-income countries slashed tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid and development support in 2025, in what the United Nations described as the sharpest funding cuts to international humanitarian efforts in history. The reductions had immediate and potentially irreversible impacts on humanitarian and migration organizations and the people they serve worldwide.

By midyear, humanitarian aid globally was down 40 percent from the prior year, leading to steep downsizing. While cuts affected all manner of humanitarian projects, billions of dollars targeted migration-related issues.

For refugees and other forcibly displaced people, the cuts resulted in reduced food, closed health facilities, and greater exposure to natural disasters, among other impacts. To take just one example, at the world’s largest refugee settlement, in Myanmar, most schools were temporarily shuttered midyear, cases of children with acute malnutrition rose by 11 percent from January to September, and reports of child marriage and child labor rose. Elsewhere, refugees were left stranded at the borders of Chad and South Sudan because aid workers did not have the money to bus them to safer locations. In Kenya’s Kakuma refugee camp, reduced food rations led to violent protests and prompted more than 6,000 South Sudanese refugees to return to their homeland.

In coming years, the funding changes are projected to lead to significantly more deaths than would have otherwise occurred. As many as 14 million deaths by 2030 could be attributable to the effective shuttering of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to one study.

The cuts in foreign aid were made across the U.S. federal government, which has historically been the world’s top aid provider, as well as by Canada, the United Kingdom, European Union countries, and South Korea. Although official development assistance had already been trending downward, the 2025 cuts were transformative. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) planned to trim its budget by one-quarter and by October had laid off nearly 5,000 staffers. The World Food Program was working to reduce staff by more than one-quarter by 2026, resulting in the elimination of some 6,000 posts. Similar dynamics affected agencies and organizations of all sizes.

Political leaders justified the reductions by saying the foreign aid did not serve taxpayers’ interests, had to be reduced to offset increased defense spending, or was otherwise unnecessary. In several cases, governments cut humanitarian assistance while boosting funds for stiffer immigration enforcement. The U.S. Congress for instance allocated more than $170 billion over four years for immigration enforcement purposes, an unprecedented increase and roughly similar to the $173 billion that had gone to USAID over the prior four fiscal years. In Europe, governments sought to pivot their migration-related spending from focusing on humanitarian and integration issues to reducing irregular movement.

In the long run, the cuts could lead to new displacement, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi warned, as tensions in migrants’ origin locations are exacerbated and transit countries lack the capacity to effectively accommodate migrants in need. Danish Refugee Council analysis suggested that U.S. cuts alone could be responsible for as many as 3.9 million more people displaced in 2025, effectively doubling the number of newly displaced people this year. At the same time, heightened border restrictions (see Item 7. Amid a Global Restrictionist Turn, Irregular Migration Drops—But Will It Last?) in many high-income countries and global withdrawal from offering legal avenues for refugees (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses) meant that many forcibly displaced people were left with few options.

Notably, some of the eliminated foreign aid programs had been designed to prevent unauthorized migration or bolster support in transit countries. At least $200 million in grants and funds terminated by the Trump administration were focused specifically on deterring irregular migration from Central America, according to Migration Policy Institute (MPI) analysis. In Ecuador, the loss of international aid was cited as a reason for canceling the government’s planned offer of regularization to Venezuelan migrants, amid a broader regional change in tone towards displaced Venezuelans.

While jarring on its own, the shift was especially notable given its break from a recent trend towards addressing the “root causes” of migration, in order to reduce the appeal of irregular movement in the first place. Given the breadth of the impact and the fact that multiple aid organizations are planning for even starker budget shortfalls in 2026, the cuts may amount to a wholesale remaking of the humanitarian and development assistance system for years to come.

2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump

President Donald Trump returned to office in January intent on profoundly altering the United States’ relationship with immigration, and quickly got to work retooling U.S. policy and seeking to reshape public attitudes towards immigrants and immigration. Within hours of his swearing-in, Trump began pursuing an historic number of deportations, reshaping the legal immigration system to be significantly more exclusive, reducing services to resident immigrants and their U.S.-born children, and reconfiguring how the United States—long home to more immigrants than any other country—considers the foreign born as part of its collective identity.

Most visible by far was the campaign for mass deportations. The administration pledged to remove 1 million unauthorized immigrants per year (although the total in 2025 will likely be closer to 600,000), and it corralled virtually every arm of the sprawling U.S. federal government to assist. Officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and other agencies were surged to U.S. cities from coast to coast, engaging in high-profile and often confrontational operations in neighborhoods, workplaces, and previously off-limits locations including schools and faith-based organizations. Congress allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years, transforming it into the largest federal law enforcement agency and prompting a quick scaling-up of detention space. The administration also terminated or allowed the expiration of multiple temporary statuses that had previously protected millions of unauthorized immigrants from being deported and allowed them to work legally.

U.S. officials were keen to highlight the punitive nature of the operations—including with memes and jokes—as part of an apparent effort to encourage unauthorized immigrants to “self-deport.”

While less sensationalist, policy changes affecting new legal arrivals and the millions of people in immigrant families—including large numbers of U.S.-born children—may prove to be even more impactful in years to come. The administration restricted or barred arrivals from 19 countries, imposed bonds of up to $15,000 for visitors of certain other nationalities, toughened the test for immigrants looking to become U.S. citizens, and added a $100,000 fee for new H-1B high-skilled visas, among other changes. The administration also began more closely policing noncitizens’ words and actions, including university student Mahmoud Khalil and other green-card holders whom the administration sought to deport for their pro-Palestinian advocacy, as well as visa holders who had posted negative comments about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk. A vast web of government data, newly handed over to immigration enforcement, is helping facilitate the vetting and serve the broader deportation agenda (see Item 5. Big Brother Hits the World of Immigration Full Force). The administration is making all 55 million holders of a U.S. visa subject to “continuous vetting,” including of their social media, and in December proposed requiring applicants for visa-free travel to provide five years’ of social media activity.

Other changes did not explicitly target the foreign born but promised to have sweeping effects on people of immigrant backgrounds. Most symbolic was the effort to end the promise of birthright citizenship, which is widely understood to be enshrined to the Constitution and was quickly paused by the courts (the Supreme Court will review the order in 2026). Other moves—such as making English the country’s official language, suing states offering in-state college tuition to some residents who are unauthorized immigrants, trying to cut funding for early childhood centers and other initiatives seen as “woke,” and further reducing access to public benefits—sought to more broadly make a distinction between people with a long ancestry in the United States and those with a more recent history.

“America is not a nation of immigrants,” a senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official claimed in November, illustrating the government’s posture and refuting a widely held narrative in place since at least the 1950s. “We are a nation of citizens. And it is because of those citizens that we are an exceptional nation.”

As result of this shift in tone, many immigrants’ fear their relationship with their adopted country is changing. Large numbers of immigrants—including many naturalized citizens—told pollsters they feared being arrested and deported, and modified their daily habits to be less visible. Enrollment of new international students at U.S. universities dropped by 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as many opted for other destinations (see Item 4. As Labor Demands Rise amid Demographic Change, Under-the-Radar Policies Seek to Fill Gaps). International travel to the United States also appeared to decline, for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

It remains too early to tell whether the Trump administration’s approach will lead to a fundamental shift in the size and composition of the U.S. immigrant population. But after one year in power, the outcome certainly seemed possible.

3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses

Long-agreed norms against pushing people back to places where they might be subject to harm underwent further backsliding in 2025. The prohibition on returning refugees and other people to precarious situations is decades old, but nonetheless seemed to be skirted or outright ignored in some cases this year; elsewhere, governments made express calls to rewrite international human-rights frameworks.

No place was this clearer than in the return this year of more than 2.7 million Afghans to their Taliban-controlled homeland, where residents face harsh restrictions on daily life and roughly half the country is confronting some sort of economic or environmental crisis. UN officials have repeatedly warned that returnees face serious human-rights threats, including the possibility of torture.

The overwhelming majority of Afghan returnees arrived from Iran or Pakistan, which have long been among the world’s largest refugee hosts but have grown more restrictive amid economic downturns and security concerns. Both countries have been running formal campaigns to encourage or force returns since 2023; these kicked into high gear this year. Germany began deportation flights to Afghanistan in 2024; Austria followed suit in 2025, and pressure increased for returns from more EU Member States. Under the Trump administration, the United States ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans in July and in some cases detained Afghans who had previously assisted U.S. military operations in the country. The U.S. government’s approach turned particularly stiff in the aftermath of the late November shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, allegedly committed by an Afghan national who arrived in 2021.

Elsewhere, a new asylum law in Egypt that transfers responsibility for refugee status determination from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to the Egyptian government was reportedly linked to an uptick in arrests and deportations of asylum seekers and others fleeing civil war in Sudan—including individuals with UNHCR legal documents. And while many people returned to Syria voluntarily, sizable numbers were also deported there—including from the European Union—or otherwise compelled to return in the months following the late 2024 overthrow of the Assad regime, amid a wide diplomatic rapprochement with the new leadership in Damascus (see Item 8. The Beginning of the End of Syria’s Long-Running Displacement?).

In other cases, the United States and other countries stretched the limits of the humanitarian protection system by shipping individuals to third-country destinations of questionable repute. U.S. officials deported asylum seekers and other unauthorized immigrants to places such as El Salvador, where some were swiftly locked in the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison and allegedly tortured. Others were sent to a range of countries particularly in Africa, including South Sudan, which only recently emerged from a protracted civil war.

Similar proposals in Europe struggled to get off the ground, but rarely for lack of trying (see Item 10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management). Migrant holding centers built by Italy in Albania, in which migrants were set to wait while their asylum claims were handled by Italian officials, were opened in 2024 but sat empty for large portions of 2025 after courts intervened. EU and British leaders also considered sending migrants whose asylum claims were denied to third countries to which they have no prior ties, known as “return hubs;” the European Council established the legal grounds for creating these facilities in December.

Meanwhile, refugee resettlement globally fell sharply. By mid-2025, just one-third as many refugees had been resettled as in the same period in 2024, a decline partly attributable to the United States, which has historically been the world leader in refugee resettlement. The U.S. program was suspended indefinitely in 2025, after President Donald Trump returned to office and embraced a more restrictive immigration approach (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump). Later in the year, the United States granted entry to a small number of White South Africans and said that it would accept no more than 7,500 refugees from South Africa or other homelands engaging in “illegal or unjust discrimination” in fiscal year (FY) 2026, down from a ceiling of 125,000 the previous year. The administration redirected a reported $250 million from the U.S. refugee resettlement program to encourage “self-deportations.”

In some cases, governments are seeking to rewrite the international rules undergirding national policies. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September, U.S. officials made a soft pitch for dramatically rethinking the 1951 Refugee Convention, notably not including a mention of upholding the principle of nonrefoulement, which prevents return to a location where someone might face persecution. Although the Trump administration had reportedly considered withdrawing the United States from the Refugee Convention, it now appears to be eyeing amendments to the Convention through a new Protocol.

Several governments in Europe meanwhile sought to either modify or reinterpret the European Convention on Human Rights, which has in the past been interpreted to prevent efforts by France, Greece, and other nations to tighten asylum laws. In May, leaders of nine EU Member States called for the Convention to be reinterpreted to loosen restrictions on repatriating migrants convicted of criminal offenses, seemingly to allow for return of those individuals to countries deemed unsafe; in December, more than two dozen countries said it was “imperative” that the framework “is fit to address today’s challenges” on managing migration and asylum.

Collectively, the trends suggest the steady winnowing of access to asylum is here to stay and may accelerate.

4. As Labor Demands Rise amid Demographic Change, Under-the-Radar Policies Seek to Fill Gaps

While the story of migration in 2025 was generally speaking one of tightened borders and stricter enforcement, several under-the-radar trends showcased how countries with aging populations and shrinking birthrates are seeking to fill labor market and skills gaps, particularly in high-skill sectors. Governments rolled out new visas for these workers, in some cases keying off policy changes in other countries to make themselves more competitive.

Even as it tightened restrictions on some types of immigration, the United Kingdom planned to double the number of high-skilled visas for foreign workers. China meanwhile unveiled a new K visa targeting young high-tech workers and researchers who meet certain criteria, in what was seen as a response to U.S. hardening of its policies for high-skilled immigrants. And the European Union plotted a new visa strategy to help the bloc fill skills and labor shortages.

Some of these moves were inspired by the tightening of policies in the United States (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump), particularly a new $100,000 fee for incoming H-1B high-skilled workers, the announcement of which caused panic and confusion among current visa holders. Most clearly, in the days after the U.S. change was announced, Canada promised an “accelerated pathway” for some H-1B holders, as part of a C$1.7 billion campaign to recruit more than 1,000 skilled researchers.

But there were other factors at work, too. The median global population has aged considerably in recent years. As residents especially of high-income countries live longer, they have grown increasingly reliant on the foreign born for care and other work.

Although Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has been one of the continent’s leading architects of restrictions on humanitarian immigration (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses), her government this year approved a decree that will allow nearly 500,000 non-EU workers to arrive over the next three years—an increase over the prior three-year period. Spain has been more vocal about its openness towards many immigrants, including Latin Americans who might in other circumstances have gone to the United States. This year Madrid enacted new regulations easing family reunification and access to legal status, among other measures, as part of an approach widely seen as helping to reverse Spain’s population decline and boost the economy. On the other side of the world, in New Zealand, the government made moves to lure digital nomads, create new pathways for skilled workers, and streamline the entry of seasonal workers.

New Zealand also relaxed rules for its Active Investor Plus visa, which offers residence to foreign nationals who make a sizable investment, resulting in a surge of new applications. Vietnam rolled out a similar “golden visa” offering ten years of legal residence to deep-pocketed individuals. And the United States unveiled a “Trump gold card” offering residence to people able to pay a $1 million fee.

In the Caribbean, a new free-movement regime came into effect, allowing nationals of Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to freely live and work in each others’ countries (see Item 10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management). The arrangement was a big step for Caribbean Community (CARICOM) efforts at regional integration, and was at least partially intended to reduce brain drain of highly educated professionals.

For international students, changes in the United States—the top destination for overseas study—further diversified a landscape that had already started to shift. The number of new international students at U.S. higher education institutions dropped 17 percent in fall 2025 compared to the prior year, as it and other traditional destinations—Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom—imposed new barriers. Many students are opting for alternative destinations, including several in East and Southeast Asia, which have sought to capitalize on the trend.

In their approaches to these workers and students, governments that have otherwise seemed immigration averse are seeking to thread the needle. Many are trying to emphasize that their openness to certain immigrants is about selectivity; to maintain a sense of control, they are trying to dictate not just who cannot enter the country, but who can.

5.Big Brother Hits the World of Immigration Full Force

Authorities worldwide in 2025 increasingly relied on advanced technologies to surveil, police, and process newly arriving migrants and settled immigrants. In some cases, technology is being used to identify, arrest, and remove noncitizens; in others, the systems are touted as ways to make travel more efficient, frictionless, and safer.

The Trump administration’s expanded deportations effort, for instance (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump), is being powered in part by immigration authorities’ access to a vast array of once off-limits government data, including tax and health-care information. U.S. officials now are using digital tools, many of them artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted, to monitor social media activity, perform facial recognition, track license plates, and scan irises, among other methods. Separately, the U.S. government has contracted with Palantir to build information systems that can identify removable noncitizens and help manage their detention and removal. To further the mission, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has proposed being able to collect biometric data including voice prints, facial imagery, iris scans, and potentially even DNA samples from immigrants of all ages. It has also offered at least one facial recognition tool to state and local authorities.

The United States is by no means alone. Russia in 2025 passed a law requiring some immigrants to use a special mobile app that tracks their location and other data. The United Kingdom began piloting a system that matches faces from a live camera feed to check against a watchlist. The United Arab Emirates and other Gulf countries have long relied on digital tools to monitor migrants; in 2025, the Emirates unveiled a new AI-backed system to speed up review of work permits.

Large portions of the European Union’s external borders have increasingly been policed by a network of AI systems, drones, and other high-tech surveillance tools designed to prevent irregular migration. Efforts ramped up, including in the asylum process, in what officials have promised would help reduce the burden on overstretched systems. The bloc also began rolling out a new Entry-Exit System (EES) for many short-term visitors, which swaps traditional passport stamps for biometric screenings. The EES was designed in part to better track foreign nationals and combat visa overstays.

Many of the efforts were criticized by privacy advocates, who fear the consequences of government overreach and warn that surveillance and vetting tools used today against immigrants will eventually be turned on all residents. Border officers in Canada also worried that their government’s embrace of border process automation, which has been ongoing since 2022, could create security gaps.

Still, the innovations pointed to the promise of swifter, faster-moving immigration systems. If successful, the processes could help people obtain protection, legal residence, work permits, and other benefits more quickly.

They also could work in other contexts. Advanced systems to forecast disaster-related displacement, which hit a high in 2024, have been growing in popularity among researchers and aid workers, and could allow both individuals and organizations to better prepare for upcoming disasters.

While many digital tools were used in 2025 to surveil, arrest, and remove people, their potential application could be much broader in the years ahead.

6. Countries in Latin America and Beyond Adjust to U.S. Mass Deportations Campaign

The fallout from the rapid-fire immigration policy changes in the United States was global and often unpredictable. Cooperation on deportation became a precondition for diplomatic engagement with Washington, and multiple countries were left reeling with the consequences of deportations and a stiffer U.S. border.

Patterns of movement through the Americas were particularly shaken up. Crossings of the treacherous Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama plummeted precipitously, down from more than 520,000 in 2023 to fewer than 3,000 in the first nine months of 2025. Multiple months saw fewer than a dozen travelers making the trek northward through the jungle. Meanwhile, more than 18,000 migrants—the vast majority of them Venezuelan—had passed through Panama southbound as of September, in a reverse flow.

Large numbers of U.S.-bound individuals were also left stranded in transit, including in Mexico, which had already seen a growing number of migrants decide to put down roots. Asylum requests in Mexico surged in the weeks after the inauguration of Donald Trump; while new arrivals fell off sharply over the year, a much larger share of these migrants sought protection in Mexico than had in years past.

Mexico and northern Central American countries—the origins of most unauthorized immigrants in the United States—also contended with high numbers of returning nationals, and developed new reintegration programs or leaned on pre-existing ones. In many cases, however, returnees struggled all the same. Some reintegration challenges were compounded by the sharp dropoff in global aid funding (see Item 1. Foreign Aid Cuts Cripple Humanitarian Efforts and Raise Prospect of New Displacement). Remittance trends to these countries went in divergent directions, as immigrants in the United States faced the threat of deportation: Financial transfers rose sharply to Central America, where they sometimes account for sizable portions of countries’ economies, but declined to Mexico.

The consequences for running afoul of the Trump administration’s restrictionism could be measured in higher tariffs and loss of diplomatic stature. In January, Colombia’s government refused to accept deportees arriving on U.S. military planes, but ultimately backed down amid a brewing trade war. The threat of steep tariffs similarly seemed to help convince countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and several in Africa to accept U.S. deportees of other nationalities, seemingly resolving Washington’s problem of what to do with nationals of “recalcitrant” countries that refuse to accept their return—though such third-country deportations have been very small to date.

The U.S. pressure was not always successful. In October, Burkina Faso declined to accept third-country deportees, and shortly thereafter the United States halted issuing visas to its citizens. Nigeria similarly refused the offer, around the time that new visa rules tightened Nigerians’ ability to travel to the United States. Mali also announced that visiting U.S. citizens would have to post a $10,000 bond, similar to a measure Washington temporarily imposed on Malians.

Farther afield, tensions between the United States and South Korea escalated following the arrest of more than 300 Korean workers at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Some individuals detained in the operation were reportedly working legally.

Meanwhile, disputes partially rooted in migration tensions began to slowly remake overarching regional and multilateral forums. The Summit of the Americas was postponed until at least 2026, the United States boycotted the Group of 20 (G20) summit in South Africa, and the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection was effectively abandoned. Combined, the trends suggest that change in Washington was not merely a temporary shift affecting a few countries, but a trigger for a much broader restructuring.

7. Amid a Global Restrictionist Turn, Irregular Migration Drops—But Will It Last?

Border restrictions, including on asylum seeking, appeared to have their desired effect in some countries in 2025, as irregular migration rates declined. The trend, which was not universal, may support the claim that transit and destination countries can deter spontaneous arrivals of asylum seekers and others—but it could also point to deferred migration aims or different patterns of movement, if migrants turn to alternate destinations or simply delay their journey for a period.

The clearest illustration of the trend was along the U.S.-Mexico border, which saw the lowest level of unauthorized arrivals since 1970, amid Trump administration hardening (see Item 2. U.S. Relationship with Immigration and Immigrants Altered under Trump) and a period of increasingly muscular enforcement, including by Mexico.

In the European Union, irregular migration dropped by more than one-fifth through the first ten months of the year and the number of arrivals across the Mediterranean was roughly half that of 2023. Much of the European Union’s efforts involved cooperation with countries in North Africa. For instance, Tunisia, which has promised Europe that “it will not become a transit zone,” had put about 10,000 irregular migrants in a voluntary return program by November, a significant increase over the 7,200 in 2024. The trend was also partly a reflection of the sharp decline in asylum applications from Syrians amid changes in their homeland (see Item 8. The Beginning of the End of Syria’s Long-Running Displacement?).

To be sure, the trend was not universal. Irregular migration to the United Kingdom grew over 2025 and neared a record as of this writing, even as the Starmer government began implementing a new arrangement with France designed to stop asylum seekers and other migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.

It is far too early to declare border-hardening policies a permanent success. Unauthorized crossings of the U.S.-Mexico border similarly plummeted when Trump first entered office in 2017, but soon thereafter began to rise. As researchers have seen in the past, harsher consequences for irregular migration tend to have the long-term effect of pushing movement further underground and making it more dangerous, potentially empowering cartels and smugglers. And while it may redistribute movement—as seen recently with rising U.S. enforcement prompting some migrants to remain in their transit location or even return to their starting point (see Item 6. Countries in Latin America and Beyond Adjust to U.S. Mass Deportations Campaign)—it is also possible that migrants will head north in the future.

In many cases, recent border restrictions have resulted in large numbers of asylum seekers and other migrants stuck in what had previously been transit countries such as Mexico and Libya. Rights advocates contend that could have serious consequences, for example in Libya, where two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of dozens of migrants were discovered in February.

Humanitarian organizations also worry about the reduced ability for asylum seekers to access protection in countries around the world.

As political leaders in Europe and the United States race to limit border arrivals and expand returns of already present irregular immigrants, they may at some point feel the downstream economic consequences of actions that are not accompanied by expanded legal pathways for in-demand workers. Declining unauthorized immigration could have resulted in as much as a 1 percent reduction in U.S. economic growth in 2025, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates.

8. The Beginning of the End of Syria’s Long-Running Displacement?

A glimmer of hope emerged in Syria after 14 years of civil war that had spawned perhaps the defining displacement crisis of the 21st century so far, with as many as 7 million Syrians forced from their country and a similar number displaced within it. The late 2024 overthrow of dictator Bashar al-Assad led to cautious optimism from the international community and prompted millions of Syrians to return to their homes.

By early December, nearly 1.3 million Syrians abroad and another 2 million internally displaced people had returned to their places of origin. Nearly one-fifth of Syrian refugees said in June that they planned to return over the next year, and four-fifths planned to go back eventually.

Neighboring countries, which have experienced strains from years of hosting Syrians, were eager to help facilitate the return movement. Turkey, home to the largest number of displaced Syrians, unveiled a “go-and-see” policy allowing individuals to head to Syria and then return without fear of losing temporary protection, as would have happened previously. Lebanon, which is host to the highest number of refugees per capita globally, helped facilitate the voluntary return of many Syrians, working with UN agencies to organize convoys of buses and trucks to transport them across the border.

The returns were a major driver in the notable decline of displacement globally in 2025, after nearly a decade of consistent growth.

While many Syrians returned by choice, some were forced to go back. Austria in July became the first EU Member State to carry out deportations to Syria since 2011, and other countries planned to follow, as part of a broader shift in norms of humanitarian protection (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses). The United Kingdom and EU countries halted processing asylum applications for Syrians, and the United States sought to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Syrians (although the effort had been blocked by a court as of this writing).

The returns accompanied a general change in international posture towards Syria, which had for many years been a pariah state. International sanctions against the country were lifted over the course of the year, and in September President Ahmed Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian leader to address the UN General Assembly in nearly six decades.

Although these developments marked a dramatic turnaround, steep challenges remain in Syria. Episodes of violence continued well into 2025, and vast swaths of the country depended on humanitarian aid. Nearly 4 million Syrians were registered refugees abroad and another 7 million remained internally displaced. A new era may have dawned in Syria, but it remains in its infancy.

9. With Armed Conflict on the Rise, Crises Endure

Emerging from what was described as the most conflict-heavy year on record, the world in 2025 was beset by protracted crises resulting in mass displacement. More state-based armed conflicts were recorded in 2024 than ever before; while several peace agreements were struck in 2025 and overall displacement declined slightly, more than 117 million people were displaced at midyear (both internationally and within their own countries), the second highest number on record.

Trends were at times multidirectional. Sudan remained the world’s largest displacement crisis, even though the number of internally displaced people shrank from 11.5 million in January to 9.6 million in September. More than 2 million people returned to Khartoum, the civil war-stricken capital, out of a total of 5 million people displaced from the city during the worst fighting. Still, it was too soon for optimism; reported atrocities in Darfur’s el-Fasher, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was accused of committing war crimes, prompted more than 106,000 people to flee in just a handful of weeks

Elsewhere in Africa, ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda signed a peace agreement in June aiming to bring calm to Eastern Congo, where years of clashes between government forces and Rwanda-backed rebels have killed thousands and displaced millions. Yet violence persisted throughout the year, and in September a UN fact-finding mission concluded that all participants have committed serious abuses that could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

Displacement in West Africa’s Sahel region crept higher, amid violent conflict and natural disasters. As Western forces withdrew and regional collaboration broke down, violent extremist groups seemed to expand into the vacuum (see Item 10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management). Instability was especially pronounced in Mali, where the al Qaeda affiliate Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) made rapid gains and prompted “unusual refugee flows” to Côte d'Ivoire.

An unprecedented 1.4 million people were also internally displaced in Haiti, where gang violence has spread rapidly since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Restrictions in nearby countries prevented many Haitians from fleeing internationally, in line with broader tightening of the protection system (see Item 3. Refugee Norms Erode as the Protection System Faces New Stresses). The Dominican Republic, the sole country sharing a land border with Haiti, carried out more than 150,000 deportations in the first five months of the year. The United States is the top destination for Haitian migrants; after entering office, the Trump administration canceled a U.S. humanitarian parole program for Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) and also sought to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitians, removing deportation protections from several hundred thousand people (a federal court temporarily blocked the termination of TPS).

A fragile ceasefire in Gaza followed efforts by Australia and Canada to offer special humanitarian visas to Palestinians with connections to those countries, although relatively few people were in position to take advantage. The United States went in the opposite direction, halting all visitor visas for Palestinians from Gaza amid a backlash from the far right. Gazans have long faced intense challenges in leaving their territory, due to Israeli and Egyptian blockades and the high costs of leaving.

In many cases, conflict-related dangers were exacerbated by environmental catastrophes. For many, the situation only deteriorated over the course of the year, amid a string of typhoons, wildfires, earthquakes, and other events around the globe. Amid a changing climate, steep cuts to foreign aid budgets (see Item 1. Foreign Aid Cuts Cripple Humanitarian Efforts and Raise Prospect of New Displacement) meant many displaced individuals in these situations had little international support to ease their suffering.

10. A Mixed Record for Regional Cooperation on Migration Management

Regional free-movement blocs in Europe and West Africa experienced some struggles in 2025, even as a new regime came into effect in the Caribbean that allows more people to live and work freely across borders. While the practicalities of regional cooperation resulted in mixed results during the year, the concept continues to have broad appeal.

Forty years after coming into being, Europe’s free-movement zone faced intense pressure. Leaders from nearly a dozen European nations imposed some form of internal border controls. Several cited national security or the prospect of heightened irregular migration, and reflected the embrace by some on the continent of far-right political concerns. Germany, which has been at the forefront of stiffening borders within the 29-member Schengen Zone, introduced new rules in May and had turned away nearly 18,600 people by November.

The European Union also faced internal tensions as it moved ahead with implementing the New Pact on Migration and Asylum. After a month-long delay, the European Commission in November announced which Member States will be eligible to receive financial and other support to handle asylum pressures, and which will be exempted from providing support. The solidarity pool, as the mechanism is known, was criticized from some corners and could point to new fractures in the future.

All the same, membership in the bloc and free movement between Member States proved to be as attractive as ever. Bulgaria and Romania formally entered the Schengen Zone on January 1, an EU-UK deal will bring down the border between Gibraltar (a British Overseas Territory) and Spain, and Cyprus (which is already an EU Member State) set a goal of fully joining Schengen in 2026. While complete consensus on Europe’s migration challenges seemed unattainable, integration had at least a continued allure.

The future looked slightly less bright in West Africa’s Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger formally left in January. The three countries are led by juntas that took power in a series of coups since 2021, and have seen worsening displacement and humanitarian situations in the years since (see Item 9. With Armed Conflict on the Rise, Crises Endure). The “Sahelexit” was a blow to regional collaboration, including on migration, and ushered in a series of ad hoc bilateral efforts on issues such as cross-border infrastructure projects and security.

Meanwhile, regional collaboration was on the rise in the Caribbean. Starting in October, nationals of Barbados, Belize, Dominica, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines have been able to freely live, work, and access public services such as education and health care in each other’s countries. The arrangement was a big step forward for efforts by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to achieve regional integration; it complements a free-movement system in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) that has been operational since 2011.

The incident became heated in bitter cold temperatures as two men stayed on top of a roof under construction for hours to avoid being taken in by federal officers.

DHS said ICE officers were conducting an operation to arrest Marco Chicaiza Dutan.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Marco is in the country illegally and has a criminal record.

According to court documents, Marco had previously been convicted in a case for disorderly conduct.

""During the operation, two suspects fled from a vehicle and entered a construction site, climbing onto a roof to evade arrest,"" said McLaughlin about Saturday’s operation.

Federal officials said the other man, Edgar Chicaiza Dutan, did come down and was taken away in an ambulance and checked out due to exposure to the cold weather. He has since been released to ICE.

ICE has said Edgar entered the U.S. illegally in 2019.

“This is about intimidation. It’s about bullying,” McIver told the Guardian. “It’s about trying to stop our level of government from having oversight and holding this administration accountable.”

The charges weren’t about her, “a little Black girl from the city of Newark”, she said, later referencing Donald Trump: “It was about using me as an example. … He hoped that what he’s doing to me, using me as an example, that it would scare other members of Congress from doing their job, from having oversight.”

Trump’s campaign of retribution against his political enemies and the left writ large has proven a key feature of his second term. He has sought to charge Democratic officials despite pushback from prosecutors. He has filed executive orders that attack specific people and organizations based on his grievances. He has cast a host of activity as related to “antifa” as a way to hinder leftwing organizing. The administration included McIver on a list of supposed “antifa violence”, alongside people charged for bomb threats and violent attacks on federal agents and facilities.

The legal turmoil stemmed from a 9 May visit to Delaney Hall, a detention facility in Newark, New Jersey. McIver, alongside other elected officials, went to conduct an inspection as part of her congressional duties. Members of Congress have oversight abilities at ICE facilities, allowing them to visit without notice – though the Trump administration has attempted to limit these visits.

During these visits, Democratic members of Congress have often found unsafe, unsanitary and substandard conditions and have met with constituents as part of their advocacy for their immigration cases. Democratic lawmakers filed a lawsuit earlier this year to force the Trump administration to follow the law on oversight visits and allow them unfettered access.

At Delaney Hall, the Newark mayor, Ras Baraka, was asked to leave because he is not a member of Congress and was arrested for trespassing. Charging documents noted that people, including members of Congress, surrounded Baraka to create a “human shield” to prevent his arrest and alleged that McIver shouted “hell no” repeatedly. Video of part of the incident shows a chaotic scene, with protesters, elected officials and agents in a scrum.

The Washington Post, after analyzing video from many angles, said McIver “made contact with at least two agents” in the scuffle, but that it was “difficult to discern the force of the contact and to what extent it was intentional or the result of the chaotic moment”.

Charges against Baraka were dropped 10 days later. But McIver was subsequently charged for assaulting, impeding and interfering with an arrest – charges that collectively could carry up to 17 years in prison. She was formally indicted by a grand jury in June. Alina Habba, who was serving as acting US attorney for the state at the time, pursued the charges. She has since resigned her role after a court found her ineligible to hold the job without confirmation.

“At the end of the day, ICE and homeland security, they created the chaos there, and that’s evident as they arrested the mayor, charged him, and then dropped the charges,” McIver said.

McIver was not at Delaney Hall to protest, she said – she was there to do her job. Delaney Hall is in her district. She serves on the homeland security committee. She had a duty as a member of Congress.

She has asked for investigations into the facility and for it to be shut down. The month after her oversight visit, four detainees escaped the facility after reportedly kicking through an interior wall. The Republicans who run the House oversight committee haven’t investigated, she said.

“I’ve seen, in my community, moms afraid to pick up their kids, people afraid to go to the doctor,” she said. “They’re terrorizing people on the street based off the color of their skin, racially profiling. I mean, we cannot allow ICE to operate in the dark.”

McIver has pleaded not guilty and fought to get the charges dismissed, arguing that she was fulfilling her duties as a member of Congress and that she was being selectively prosecuted, noting the president’s pardons of those charged and convicted for their roles in the January 6 insurrection under the same statutes under which she was charged.

A judge denied the motion to dismiss on two of the counts, writing that she had “not demonstrated that her prosecution is a result of personal animus harbored by the prosecution”. A ruling on whether the assault charge should be dismissed is expected soon. A trial date has not yet been set.

After the charges were filed, Trump said he didn’t know who McIver was, but that “the days of woke are over”.

“That woman was out of control,” he said of McIver. “She was shoving federal agents. She was out of control. The days of that crap are over in this country. We’re going to have law and order.”

McIver, 39, was first elected in a special election in New Jersey’s 10th congressional district in September 2024 following the death of Donald Payne Jr. She won a full term two months later. Before Congress, she served for several years in local elected roles. She was an immediate, outspoken critic to Trump after he was sworn in for his second term.

The case has been time-consuming, distracting and expensive. She’s had to pay a million dollars for representation in the case, raising funds for legal assistance because she can’t accept pro bono help because of ethics rules (despite the administration “using your money and tax dollars to prosecute me”). Some Republicans, led by Nancy Mace, sought to expel her after the charges were filed.

The stress of a potential 17 years in prison weighs on her personally as well. She has a nine-year-old child, a spouse, a mother “who’s worried to death about what this administration will do to her daughter”.

“It actually breaks my heart that this is the country that we’re living in with this president who, quite honestly, is cruel and doesn’t give a damn,” she said.

Ankush Khardori, a Politico writer and former federal prosecutor, wrote that the government’s case was “likely to be a dud”.

“The charges certainly appear to many as both politically motivated and, at a bare minimum, unwarranted as a matter of appropriate prosecutorial discretion,” Khardori wrote.

McIver sees the case against her as another example of Trump’s fear-based agenda, a way to make people frightened and thus unwilling to fight back. But her district elected her to protect them, and she’s going to continue doing so, she said.

“Sometimes that comes with a sacrifice, a personal sacrifice, which is what I’m going through right now, and I think my constituents want to continue to see me make personal sacrifices to protect them against a very dangerous president and administration,” she said.

She has faith in the legal system, but said she’s “taking one day at a time” on fighting the charges. “This is a new situation for me. I’m not a known criminal. This is not something that was in my trajectory.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91669f9f03ad4808d0a92be73e3d156cd8b5238a/327_0_3346_2675/master/3346.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=204be444e1b05d0588c019e3e5482d43",N,,2025-12-17 10:57:31.032320

Medical Neglect at ICE Detention Center While he was detained in a different California immigration detention center in 2024, Viera Reyes was in agonizing pain, and had blood in his urine and stool.
Detention administrators failed to get him that biopsy before he was transferred to California City Detention Facility, the largest immigration detention center in the state, in August 2025.
ICE also did not send his health care records with him when he was transferred from another ICE facility to California City, further delaying his treatment.
Viera Reyes had heard that the man left a note that said he would rather die in America than be deported.","When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Fernando Viera Reyes, his first concern was deportation. His second: prostate cancer.

“It’s one thing being healthy and going through that, but now there’s no medical attention,” Viera Reyes said. “I talked to guys who had been in detention. One guy said you’re not going to make it. You’re going to suffer.”

Viera Reyes is among seven people detained by ICE who sued the Trump administration on November 12 over inhumane conditions at the privately owned California City Detention Facility. The plaintiffs filed their lawsuit with the support of the ACLU, California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, Prison Law Office, and Keker Van Nest & Peters as a class action representing all people detained at California City. They cite punishing conditions, enforced isolation, neglect of people with disabilities, denial of access to counsel, and, as in Viera Reyes’ case, the facility’s terrifyingly inadequate medical care. ICE’s neglect of Viera Reyes’s medical condition is so severe that he filed an emergency motion.

Medical Neglect at ICE Detention Center

While he was detained in a different California immigration detention center in 2024, Viera Reyes was in agonizing pain, and had blood in his urine and stool. He underwent multiple tests that showed signs of prostate cancer. Viera Reyes has since been in an endless limbo of trying to get a final test: a biopsy to diagnose the cancer, so he can receive prompt treatment.

Detention administrators failed to get him that biopsy before he was transferred to California City Detention Facility, the largest immigration detention center in the state, in August 2025. Since his transfer, Viera Reyes’ barriers to treatment and painful uncertainty regarding his health have worsened. Not only has ICE thwarted his attempts to get a biopsy, Viera Reyes also cannot access the medication he needs to manage symptoms. He has had difficulty seeing a doctor, let alone a specialist. ICE also did not send his health care records with him when he was transferred from another ICE facility to California City, further delaying his treatment. At this point, he has reason to believe his cancer has spread.

Since Viera Reyes arrived at California City, his health has gotten worse. He stays in bed more than he used to. It’s difficult for him to use the bathroom without feeling pain and discomfort, especially without medication. Lately, a pulsating feeling has intensified.

“I was in prison for over 30 years,” Viera Reyes said. “The conditions at California City are worse.”

At least in prison there were fewer barriers to access medical care than he has faced in ICE detention. He was also able to work out, participate in classes and go to church. Now, all he can do to distract himself is watch television. “I always worry. My mind right now is racing,” he said. “We’re just stuck and the only thing that works a lot is our mind, the anxiety.”

Because the levels in his blood work that indicate illness are escalating, Viera Reyes has advocated constantly for his own wellbeing by putting in multiple emergency requests to see a urologist, but his requests have been ignored. When he reported the pain he was experiencing and asked for medication, the doctor prescribed him Vitamin C. Others told him to buy Tylenol from the commissary.

ICE Detention Center Violates Immigrant Rights and Basic Needs

Despite the egregious medical neglect Viera Reyes is experiencing, his story is just one among the hundreds of people detained at California City. Led by the people detained, the lawsuit unveils the myriad ways that ICE and the Department of Homeland Security fail to accommodate basic human needs for the people in their care.Fernando Gomez Ruiz, another person who is suing ICE alongside Viera Reyes, was repeatedly denied insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels. He also has an ulcer on his foot that he was not getting proper treatment for. Another plaintiff, Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, could not get his heart medications, even though he had two emergency room visits as soon as he arrived at the facility. The emergency room doctor told the facility that he urgently needed to see a cardiac specialist within 72 hours. He is still waiting for that specialist appointment three months later.

Plaintiffs in the lawsuit also cite excessively restrictive and punitive conditions. For example, Gustavo Guevara Alarcon was placed in solitary confinement for asking to finish his shower.

“Sometimes it feels like they’re treating us like prisoners, but we’re not,” Viera Reyes said. “It’s like they want us to act like prisoners. They want us to be hostile, even for medical reasons, banging on the door and yelling.”

In addition to the severely broken medical system at California City, people with disabilities are denied basic accommodations, such as sign language interpreters and wheelchairs. One plaintiff in the lawsuit who is Deaf and only speaks in American Sign Language, Jose Ruiz Canizales, has only interacted with a sign language interpreter by the facility once, via video. It’s made him feel completely isolated. When he tried to communicate with staff, they would often shrug their shoulders, walk away, or laugh at him.

“So often what happens in a detention facility behind locked doors and barbed wire is invisible to the public,” said Kyle Virgien, senior staff attorney at the ACLU National Prison Project. “It's really important that people know what's being done by our government in our name.”

Detained People Describe Punitive Treatment and Harsh Conditions

The facility holds people in small concrete cells the size of a parking space for hours on end without adequate clothing, food, or water. They deny people basic medical care, disability accommodations, and access to their lawyers and loved ones. Sewage bubbles up from the shower drains, and insects crawl up and down the walls of the cells in the decrepit facility. Officers threaten people who speak out against the abusive conditions with violence and solitary confinement, which they use excessively. Temperatures are frigid. Some wear socks on their arms as sleeves to stay warm.

California City previously operated as a state prison in the middle of the Mojave Desert managed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. ICE contracted with the for-profit company CoreCivic to re-open the prison as an immigration detention center this year. It can hold up to 2,560 immigrants in the facility. Since its re-opening, it has come under intense criticism, with people detained at California City describing the facility as a “torture chamber,” and community members expressing outrage over its deplorable conditions. Detained people also have engaged in numerous sit-ins and hunger strikes, including in mid-September, when over 100 people across several housing pods engaged in collective action to demand an end to many of the abuses the lawsuit challenges.

“It's important to remember we lawyers have the freedom to bring this lawsuit without facing many personal consequences,” Virgien said. “But for the people on the inside, they are standing up against the government while they are under complete control of the government. So the fact that they're willing to stand up even though they might face retaliation or harm is just truly impressive. I'm so honored to be able to fight alongside them.”

Immigrants Detained Struggle to Maintain Hope in the Face of Deportation and Mistreatment

While some have been empowered to fight back, pervasive fear and suffering have driven others to abandon their legal rights and agree to deportation.

One man at California City attempted suicide by hanging. He remains anonymous in the lawsuit. Another plaintiff, Sokhean Keo, who was friends with that man, saw his body hanging in the cell. The man survived and was transported to receive medical care. California City staff did not offer mental-health services to the people who had witnessed his suicide attempt. Instead, staff disciplined anyone who had not returned to their cells after the incident, people who remain haunted by the image of their friend’s body hanging in his cell.

Viera Reyes had heard that the man left a note that said he would rather die in America than be deported. “It triggered something in my mind like, ‘Wow, he has a point.’ I put myself in his shoes, because I know what’s going to happen to me if I get deported. But you start thinking about your family.”

At least two other detained people have attempted suicide, and others believe the number is higher. The desolation and desperation has rattled Viera Reyes. He said he tells other detained people in the facility: “Faith is going to have to be your base. Stand on that and believe that something is going to change,” he said. “I know I’m going through pain and I know they’re not doing what they’re supposed to do, but we have to have determination.”",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/12/ACLU_CADetention_Web_s.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:58:09.514007

Then jail staff intervened,Stephanie Zappelli,,,,,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/article313733507.html,"The ICE agents stood near the large, blue jail release door, which separates the jail from the lobby, Del told The Tribune.

When the jail door opened, the protesters yelled, “La migra está aquí,” or “ICE is here,” to warn the inmate.
Two of the suspected ICE agents immediately entered the secure portion of the jail where the inmate was standing.
Eventually, the suspected ICE agents left the jail, according to CJ, Del and Sue.","Suspected U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents rushed into a secure portion of the San Luis Obispo County Jail to grab an inmate on Sunday — and jail staff intervened, witnesses say.

While about 40 protesters with the nonprofit organization Indivisible gathered at the corner of Highway 1 and Kansas Avenue at 9 a.m. to protest ICE, three familiar vehicles drove into the jail parking lot.

805 UndocuFund volunteers have seen those vehicles on the scene of ICE operations and entering and exiting the Santa Maria ICE Facility, volunteers told The Tribune. ICE did not respond to a request for comment about the incident.

According to protesters at the scene, four men exited the vehicles wearing face masks, sunglasses and vests that said “police.” They filed into the jail lobby at 9:15 a.m. alongside a handful of protesters and 805 UndocuFund rapid responders.

A protester named Del and a rapid responder named CJ said they both entered the lobby with the ICE agents. Del and CJ declined to share their last names with The Tribune for fear of retaliation.

The ICE agents stood near the large, blue jail release door, which separates the jail from the lobby, Del told The Tribune.

Del said she heard the door “click” and prepared for an inmate to step out.

“Whenever that blue door is about to open, and we’re unsure of who’s coming out of that door — a brown person or a white person — that’s when it escalates,” she said.

Del said she’s watched ICE agents treat white people differently than people of color. If a white person walks out of the jail, the officers move aside to let them pass. If a person of color walks out of the jail, ICE pounces on them, she said.

When the jail door opened, the protesters yelled, “La migra está aquí,” or “ICE is here,” to warn the inmate.

Then, the man stepped into the lobby, and the officers handcuffed him without presenting a warrant or identifying themselves, Del said. The officers then escorted him to a vehicle in the parking lot and closed the door, she said.

CJ echoed Del’s statements.

“It’s heartbreaking,” Del told The Tribune. “It feels cruel. It makes me angry that we allow this to happen without due process, without being shown a warrant, right under the noses of the sheriff in a public space.”

Suspected ICE agent pushes protester

Three of the officers then returned to the lobby, where about 20 protesters from Indivisible and 805 UndocuFund had since gathered, witnesses told The Tribune.

Tension escalated in the room as the officers and activists argued with each other, Indivisible protester Sue M. said. She declined to share her full last name for fear of retaliation.

Sue and CJ said they positioned themselves near the jail release door with signs that said, “ICE está en la carcel,” which means, “ICE is in the jail.” The sign also included 805 UndocuFund’s rapid response hotline number, 805-870-8855.

The pair said they planned to flash their signs at the inmate before he entered the lobby as a warning.

The officers then told Sue to move away from the door if it opened, and she said she told them she would. She heard the inner door click and prepared to walk away, but two officers grabbed her arms and another pushed her on the back — causing her to stumble forward, she said.

CJ said the officers then ordered her out of the way, and she said, “Yes, I’m moving,” and started walking away. Then one of the officers pushed her, she said.

“He’s got guns, pepper spray, taser, baton — and I’m a 4-foot-11 girl,” CJ said. “I don’t know why he feels the need to do that.”

Then, a white man walked out of the jail release door. The officers stepped aside so he could walk out of the lobby, according to CJ, Del and Sue. This happened twice, they said.

Suspected ICE agents rush secure portion of jail

The inner door “clicked” once again at about 10:30 a.m., and the protesters yelled “ICE está aqui” as the door opened, a video showed.

805 UndocuFund shared the video with The Tribune to corroborate the story, but The Tribune will not publish the video to protect the identity of the inmate.

Two of the suspected ICE agents immediately entered the secure portion of the jail where the inmate was standing. The inmate, who wasn’t white, started walking backwards, then the agents grabbed him and pressed him against the wall, the video showed.

Then, jail staff placed themselves between the officers and the inmate.

The officers returned to the lobby, and jail staff closed the blue door without the man leaving the jail.

Eventually, the suspected ICE agents left the jail, according to CJ, Del and Sue.

The Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident, agency spokesperson Tony Cipolla said on Tuesday.

“Our understanding is that there was a confrontation between protesters and ICE agents in the lobby and we are investigating to see what occurred,” he said in a statement. “At this time, we don’t have any further comment until we receive more information on the incident.”",https://www.sanluisobispo.com/public/latest-news/p4ippx/picture313758540/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/ICE%20jail%20lobby.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 11:58:34.206773

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a ""clear defeat"" for Paxton.

""These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes, and contribute every single day to Harris County,"" Menefee, who is in a runoff for the 18th Congressional District, said.","A Harris County judge on Tuesday rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's attempt to shut down a program that allocates county funds to help undocumented people access legal support.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and in October appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

Paxton had called the program ""evil and wicked,"" as well as unconstitutional. On Tuesday, a judge disagreed, declining to block the program.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a ""clear defeat"" for Paxton.

""The court saw this lawsuit for exactly what it was: a cheap political stunt designed to score headlines,"" Menefee said. ""Harris County will not be intimidated or pushed around by state officials who are more interested in pandering than governing.""

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

""When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don't have an attorney, they're deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,"" Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs ""serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.""

He asked the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: After Tuesday's ruling, Menefee accused Paxton of cherry-picking facts about the program and ignoring its ""clear public purpose.""

""These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes, and contribute every single day to Harris County,"" Menefee, who is in a runoff for the 18th Congressional District, said. ""Making sure they can resolve their immigration status strengthens our economy, keeps families together, and makes our community safer.""

In a statement, Menefee and members of the Harris County Commissioners' Court accused Paxton of using this program to bolster his conservative credentials during a heated primary for U.S. Senate.

""Providing legal support to immigrants who are trying to ‘do it the right way' was never a concern to the Attorney General's Office,"" Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. ""That is, until Ken Paxton decided to run for higher office.""

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

""Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,"" he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. ""In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/17081824/PersonInHandcuffsWithFolder-T-1500x991.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 12:58:39.260118

They’re destroying their countries.”

Britain’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, agrees. As Trump’s newest broadside rocked Europe, Starmer and Danish premier Mette Frederiksen launched an intervention in the Guardian, calling for sweeping changes to the established European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to speed up deportation rates. Both nominally on the center left of politics, they are leading a cross-European bid to push the Council of Europe, which oversees the ECHR, to make these changes.

Unity between British centrists and US conservatives in undermining international laws and norms is nothing new. We’d seen it already during the global “war on terror” or the Gaza genocide. On both sides of the Atlantic, governments have long dropped the pretense of abiding moral and legal norms on migration.

The pace of this shift is nevertheless surprising. Until recently, calls to amend or drop the ECHR had been confined to right-wing hard-liners. Now Starmer has taken them mainstream. He frames this as a response to ordinary people’s concerns. It seems doubtful that amid a crippling cost-of-living crisis, such European jurisprudence is dominating many people’s kitchen-table discussions.

Look closer and the substance of the argument gets odder. If one believes Britain’s hysterical tabloid press, the ECHR is a cudgel wielded by activist lawyers to frustrate any attempt to deport even the most violent foreign criminals. In August, a national furor broke out over a claim that an offender could not be deported because of his son’s human right to eat his favorite brand of chicken nuggets, only available on British shelves.

Nuggetgate was not true, and neither was the narrative behind it. Less than one in every hundred foreign-national convicts succeeds in appealing a deportation decision. Around one in sixty cases of people who claim that their rights under the ECHR have been violated have anything to do with immigration. In the last forty-five years, the ECHR has ruled against the British state in only thirteen immigration removal cases. The country’s immigration rules have been found in violation of the ECHR on just three occasions.

The ECHR does provide some protections used in immigration cases. But that’s not why conservatives hate it. It is just the latest target for their standard playbook. The attack on a minority (in this case asylum seekers) provides an excuse to roll back everyone’s legal protections.

British right-wingers cast the ECHR as a tool of elites, but they hate it for its intermittent ability to restrain elite power. Rulings have helped workers avoid being penalized for joining unions, restrained police forces from using mass surveillance, and taken steps toward leveling the playing field between large corporations and ordinary claimants in court.

It’s unsurprising that the Right works to undermine human rights. A more interesting question is: What’s in it for the Labour Party?

A New Era

“The current asylum framework was created for another era,” opens Starmer and Frederiksen’s article. “In a world with mass mobility, yesterday’s answers do not work.”

The context surely has changed — albeit in the opposite way to what these narrators imply. When the Refugee Convention and ECHR were written, up to sixty-five million people had been displaced across Europe after World War II. Today’s total is barely a sixth of that, with the largest group being those displaced from Ukraine in 2022. While contemporary Europe certainly has its problems, most of its major cities are no longer smoldering piles of rubble.

This deeply misleading start sets the tone for Starmer and Frederiksen’s loose relationship with facts and coherence throughout. The point of their intervention is to announce proposals to the ECHR, but they don’t deign to mention this until the final paragraphs.

While claiming they want to focus on faster removals of foreign criminals, they also point to a desire to make life harder for refugees across the board. Their first proposed change is intended to prevent migrants from reuniting with their families in Britain, through a reinterpretation of the meaning of a right to a family life.

The second thing Starmer and his allies find objectionable is how the ECHR’s judges have interpreted the right to freedom from torture in migration cases. This precedent is rooted in a 1988 ruling (not a migration case), which prevented a murder suspect from being extradited to the United States due to that country’s use of the death penalty.

It is unclear whether Starmer wants weaker definitions of freedom from torture and family life rights for everyone. Maybe he wants to stop at creating a category of second-class citizens among asylum seekers — though this also undermines the point of universal human rights. In practice, the point regarding torture seems likely related to Europe’s current major push to deport more people to Afghanistan, even under Taliban rule.

Authoritarians

Starmer is working with Frederiksen for a reason. Denmark is perhaps the sole example of a European country where Social Democrats have introduced harsh migration policy in office and retained power. In other countries, such concessions to right-wing claims have been rewarded by electoral defeat.

Denmark is a small, relatively tight-knit country with little imperial history, low migration levels, and higher wealth equality. For these reasons and more, conditions there do not map well onto Britain. And even in Denmark, the Social Democrats’ drift rightward was recently a key factor in their losing the capital city of Copenhagen for the first time in a century to the Left.

The surface-level politics of the ECHR move are about panicked Labour strategists inventing incoherent schemes to neutralize the meteoric rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK. But this is not all that’s going on.

Internationally, Starmer’s Britain is attempting to position itself at the helm of a new multilateral regime of transnational policing, globalized migration controls, and rearmament, replacing the liberal universalism of structures like the ECHR with cross-border authoritarianism.

This is mirrored by Labour’s striking descent into authoritarian domestic policy, even relative to its Conservative predecessor.

The most notable example is the declaration of protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization, a move extreme enough to be decried even by a former Royal Air Force officer once charged with securing nuclear bases against mass protests.

The Palestine Action ban and harsh treatment of climate protesters can also be somewhat read as appeasement of Britain’s right. But the same does not apply to Labour’s deeply unpopular proposals to introduce compulsory digital ID, which is moving ahead despite a backlash across the political spectrum. The Right also has its own account of the civil liberties critique, mainly in opposition to draconian sentences for incendiary social media posts. In short, no one is buying what Starmer is selling.

It is Labour, not the Right, that is currently using claims of crime, domestic extremism, and migration crisis to roll back civil liberties at scale.

To do so, they are diverting already strained public resources into this authoritarian project. Controversial US tech and weapons firm Anduril has been brought in to blanket the South Coast in high-tech watchtowers, as part of billions in funding set aside for controlling Channel migration. The close access to government and public services enjoyed by Palantir and other Big Tech actors is facing increasing scrutiny. So too is Britain’s association with violent border controls overseas and arms exports to wars of aggression.

In the context of this wider authoritarian drive, the rationale behind undermining frameworks like the ECHR, which provide checks on state power, becomes clearer.

Mr Rules?

There is an obvious irony in Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, leading a global charge to weaken human rights. There are also precedents for Starmer’s authoritarian shift in office, including his push when he was Britain’s prosecutions chief for harsh sentences over relatively low-level offences.

His team has squared these contradictions by portraying him as “Mr Rules,” a technocrat who is passionate about ensuring things are done properly, which may result in different outcomes at different times.

But the ECHR move, and the wider shift it symbolizes, is not upholding a rules-based order so much as dismantling it.

Like the Palestine Action ban, or the various ill-considered changes to asylum rules, the attempt to reinterpret the ECHR creates a more chaotic, less rule-bound system that is more amenable to abuses of power. Its underlying logic, by which politicians not only draft laws but dictate their interpretation by the courts, has dangerous implications.

It’s hardly just activist lawyers sounding the alarm. Even the House of Lords’ Constitution Committee now thinks that the rule of law is under threat.

Amending the ECHR will hardly revolutionize British migration policy, as the Law Society points out. ECHR members including Greece, Turkey, Poland, and Italy have managed to commit or sponsor extreme and large-scale human rights violations against people migrating while hanging on to their membership cards. But it sends a powerful signal that even apparently established norms can now be rewritten.

Britain’s political class is painfully aware of a vacuum of public trust in politics and eroded popular consent for their rule. In Britain and across Europe, the center’s twofold response has been ideological concessions to the radical right, while building their own machinery to manage crisis by controlling dissent.

Labour’s case to its supporters is that they should give it room to maneuver, because while it might make people uncomfortable, the alternative is Reform. The approach doesn’t work, but the argument also misses the point.

Reform UK would be far more aggressive in reshaping society for the worse. By normalizing its talking points and creating new legal infrastructure for it to use, Starmer is simply clearing the road for reaction. It’s making his opponents’ lives easier.

A letter sent Tuesday from Democratic U.S. Senator Patty Murray’s office to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons lays out mounting concerns about access to legal counsel and medical care, and raises questions about whether staffing at the detention center is adequate.

The letter cites reports from local service providers and advocates with access to the facility, including reports of at least three pregnant women in detention who claim they have not been able to receive appropriate medical care. It also references two suicide attempts in April and challenges for detainees to access behavioral care.

“None of this is remotely acceptable — you and the entire Trump administration have a basic moral and legal obligation to the people who have been detained and are under your care,” the letter states.

The letter demands increased oversight and “immediate steps to improve conditions and practices at [the detention center] to comply with existing standards and laws and ensure that people in immigration detention are being treated with basic dignity and respect.”

“Violations of the law or any abuse of human rights will not go unnoticed or unchallenged,” the letter states, referencing national detention standards that set guidelines for the facility.

Democratic U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell also signed the letter, along with seven Democratic U.S. Representatives from Washington: Emily Randall, Pramila Jayapal, Kim Schrier, Suzan DelBene, Adam Smith, Rick Larsen, and Marilyn Strickland.

WA Congressional Delegation Oversight Letter to ICE.pdf

12/16/25 letter from Sen. Patty Murray and WA Congress members to ICE regarding conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center.

Questions about staffing levels at the facility have persisted this year as ICE arrests increased and the Tacoma detention center filled to capacity. ICE makes some detention statistics publicly available but it doesn’t provide an ongoing headcount of detainees at each facility. Several academic researchers, however, do track headcount through ongoing public records requests.

Records show the daily headcount at the Tacoma facility nearly doubled during President Trump’s first six months in office, and at times this summer appeared to surpass the facility’s capacity of 1,575 beds, according to government data provided by ICE, processed by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

The latest available data shows a headcount of 1,427 people held at the Tacoma facility on Oct. 16.

Detainees have engaged in hunger strikes over the years to protest living conditions at the facility, and recently more detainees and advocates are pointing to a staffing shortage as an exacerbating issue.

“I talked to a lot of the guards there and they all would tell me that they were very short [staffed], and so that's why our food or the medical attention was never on time for folks,” Alfredo Juarez Zeferino told KUOW in July, after spending four months in the Tacoma detention center before deciding to give up his legal fight and return to Mexico.

“If we're sick and we need to see a doctor, we have to wait for a whole day or multiple days before we can go see a doctor,” Juarez said.

Juarez, a well-known farm labor organizer in Washington’s Skagit Valley, was detained by ICE in March due to a traffic stop in his teens, which briefly landed him in ICE custody and with a deportation order he said he never knew about until immigration agents arrived this year to enforce it.

“If we can get answers back from this [letter], then we can use that information to require them to put more, let's say, medical doctors or healthcare doctors at the facility, to improve the food service,” Murray said Tuesday in an interview with KUOW.

The Congress members’ letter also highlights concerns about access to legal counsel.

Sponsored

“Attorneys have faced significant delays to meet with their clients, making adequate legal counsel more difficult,” the letter states. “At times, attorneys have had to wait at the facility for up to 6 hours to see their clients.”

The facility has typically allocated seven rooms for attorneys to privately meet with clients, but some of these rooms are now being used for virtual attorney meetings or video hearings.

“We have also heard from advocates with access to the facility that, at times, only one visitation room was available and interviews for facility staff were being conducted in these attorney visitation rooms, ” the letter states.

Elizabeth Benki, a directing attorney with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, told KUOW these recent obstacles and slowdowns at the detention center have affected her organization’s ability to take on as many cases as it normally would.

“Each case is just more time-consuming,” she said. “It requires so many more hours and each case can be so much more unpredictable. It would be the outlier if you had to wait in the past to meet with a client, whereas now it's more the standard.”

Sponsored

The letter also calls for ICE to release noncitizens who do not pose a threat to public safety, as the issue of detainees getting released on bond continues to be a hurdle.

Recent court rulings struck down a Trump administration policy to deny bond to a broad category of people who previously were eligible, including people with no criminal history. Still, Benki said judges in Tacoma are not following that order, requiring attorneys to petition in federal court to get detainees released on bond.

“We anticipated that the Tacoma judges would follow that order but they have not been, so we've been forced to file these enforcement actions,” Benki said. Those extra court filings also cut into the time attorneys would otherwise spend on additional cases at the detention center, she added.

“It's never been this tough,” Benki said. “It’s pretty devastating, the year that our staff have had…having really huge hurdles put in front of us.”

Tuesday’s letter gives ICE a Jan. 16 deadline to answer several questions about staffing levels, detainee headcount, medical and legal services, and other human rights concerns at the Northwest ICE Processing Center.

In recent months, KUOW has also made multiple, similar information requests to ICE and GEO Group, the private contractor that operates the Tacoma facility. ICE has not provided answers, and in response to KUOW’s questions this week about staffing levels and various policies raised in the letter, an ICE spokesperson recommended “a FOIA request to get personal information on a detainee.”

Murray said she will continue to track these ongoing concerns at the detention center and use her oversight position on the Senate Appropriations Committee to hold ICE accountable.

“We can enforce our immigration laws in a humane way,” Murray said. “It seems to me that what the Trump administration is doing is using cruelty as immigration enforcement and that, to me, is unacceptable.”

The state’s website launch comes as Newsom seeks to cast California as a national leader in responsible governance of artificial intelligence.","Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a new state-run website Tuesday that tracks what his office calls the “criminal cronies” around President Trump — just the latest trolling tactic by the California governor that directly mirrors Trump’s own use of public resources for political score settling.

Newsom pegged the website’s rollout to recent crime statistics, which were released in early November showing falling rates of homicide and assault in California. The governor’s website catalogs what it calls the top 10 criminal convictions that were followed by pardons offered thus far by Trump — from Jan. 6 rioters to former politicians and business figures convicted of fraud, drug trafficking and financial crimes. The website calls Trump the “criminal in chief.”

The website features AI-generated portraits of such figues as Rod Blagojevich, the only Illinois governor to be impeached and removed from office; former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted of drug trafficking; and Ross Ulbricht, the founder of a dark-web drug marketplace who had been serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. The images show the men standing in a lineup with the word “felon” stamped in red ink.

“With crime dropping — again — California is proving what real public safety leadership looks like,” read a statement from Newsom. “Meanwhile in D.C., Trump is a felon who surrounds himself with scammers and drug traffickers. We’re providing the public with a resource putting the facts in one place so Californians, and all Americans, can see who he elevates and who he protects.”

The launch is the latest escalation in Newsom’s increasingly aggressive digital campaign against Trump. In recent months, the governor and his press office have turned social media into a near-daily forum for mocking and trolling the president by firing off all-caps posts, meme-style graphics and sharply worded rebukes aimed at Trump’s brash rhetoric, criminal record, policy proposals and political allies.

Republican strategist Rob Stutzman, who is openly critical of Trump, said Newsom’s latest tactic may be moving past parody and instead “perpetuating the Trump denigration” of societal norms and public confidence in institutions.

“Newsom’s online campaign mocking Trump has clearly been part of his rise in popularity with base Democrat voters,” Stuzman said. “But by doing so from a taxpayer financed website with state employees, he is agreeing to disregard previous norms for public institutions that Trump has dismantled. Be careful to not become that which you despise.”

Others, including Mike Madrid, a GOP strategist and co-founder of the anti-Trump political action committee known as the Lincoln Project, said Newsom’s mirroring can’t go too far when it’s simply showing what the president is doing himself. Madrid called Newsom’s approach “fantastic.”

“He’s turning the tables completely on Trump. Completely,” Madrid said. “The more Trump attacks him, the more Trump’s enablers attack him, the stronger he’s gonna get ... Do I like the fact that taxpayer dollars are being used this way? No, but that train left the station on January 2017 when Trump took office the first time.”

The crime data, which were released Nov. 3 by the Major Cities Chiefs Assn., found homicides across California’s major cities fell 18% year over year, robberies dropped 18% and aggravated assaults declined 9%. The association also found that violent crime decreased in every California city reporting data, with the steepest declines in Oakland, where violent crime fell 25%, and San Francisco, where it fell 21%.

Newsom’s new website highlights Trump’s sweeping use of presidential pardons to grant clemency to roughly 1,500 people charged or convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The governor’s office said some of those individuals had prior criminal records and that others went on to be convicted of new crimes after receiving pardons.

The move mirrors tactics Trump and his administration have embraced. Most recently, Trump unveiled a website of “media offenders,” naming journalists and outlets he accuses of bias. Newsom’s office pushed back on the comparison, saying the journalists targeted by Trump were accused of bias rather than criminal conduct, unlike those listed on the California site.

Separately, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Kristi Noem has maintained a website highlighting what it calls the “worst of the worst” criminal immigrants arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, framing the page as evidence that the administration is carrying out Trump’s promise of mass deportations.

The state’s website launch comes as Newsom seeks to cast California as a national leader in responsible governance of artificial intelligence.

Earlier Tuesday, the governor announced a slate of initiatives aimed at promoting ethical AI use in state government, including a new advisory council, partnerships with academic and nonprofit groups, and a generative AI assistant for state employees. Among the priorities outlined are strengthening safeguards for children online, countering image-based abuse and improving government operations.

“California is at the forefront of AI technology — and is home to some of the most successful and innovative companies and academic leaders in the world,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’re not going to sit on the sidelines and let others define the future for us. But we’re going to do it responsibly — making sure we capture the benefits, mitigate the harms, and continue to lead with the values that define this state.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4231d52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+283/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff7%2F10%2Fd956ee3c43a8aec41546eac8fcb4%2Fla-photos-1staff-682883-na-pol-certification-protest-kkn-0249.JPG,N,,2025-12-17 10:57:39.743520

A military-style ICE raid occurs at a grocery story in West Norriton, Pennsylvania on July 16, 2025. How would you feel if you found this waiting for you on your next trip to buy groceries?

These are real questions and comments I’ve heard from the kids I work with at Project Libertad in recent days, as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) terrorizes their communities daily. While newcomers have always faced higher rates of anxiety, depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and other mental health challenges than their US-born peers, the divide is becoming more apparent each day. These conversations with my kids represent a stark increase in fear and anxiety among immigrant children—and it’s not just an anecdotal shift. The data are clear: The Trump administration’s increasingly hostile immigration policies are irreversibly harming children.

Pediatricians Susan Kressly and Michelle Barnes warn of the lifelong impact these policies have on children’s development and health into adulthood:

Witnessing harm to others and living in constant fear is traumatic to all children in the community. These stressors disrupt brain development and have long-term negative effects on the health and well-being of impacted children. Ultimately, the cumulative effects make these communities less healthy.

Similarly, nonprofit newsroom CalMatters documents strained mental health among schoolchildren across California after a summer of widespread, aggressive ICE raids and warns of the long-term harm to children:

Experts say these raids and their aftermath may also have long-term consequences. Constant vigilance and worry puts children at greater risk of developing chronic anxiety and depression. Those who are separated from a parent face a host of social and emotional challenges.

A 2025 study in the Children and Youth Services Review showed that childhood exposure to “severe immigration enforcement”—which includes not just deportation, but also things like fear or arrest—is “significantly associated” with having anxiety as a young adult. The study’s authors call for “reforming immigration policies that unnecessarily harm members of families… and encourages social workers and allied professionals to recognize exposure to enforcement as a traumatic experience...”

A new report in Psychiatry Online highlights the long-term, generational trauma caused by immigration enforcement and calls for the mental health community to not only improve treatment for immigrant youth and families, but also to join advocacy efforts in support of their immigrant patients.

Another recent study out of Florida from the from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows a 22% increase in student absences since January, a direct result of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement there. The study blames fears of deportation and family separation for the decrease in school attendance. That same study showed a decrease in students’ test scores linked to immigration enforcement.

The trauma of mass deportation also impacts US-born children of immigrant parents, who live in constant fear of being separated from their parents. For many, that nightmare has now become a reality. CNN identified over 100 US citizen children who were left behind after a parent was deported, ranging in age from babies to teens.

The research is clear; there is no debate to be had: US immigration policy is hurting children. All that’s left to do is decide what type of society we want to be. Are we a society that cares about the well-being of children? It’s a yes or no question. There’s no “but” or “if” or “only certain children” or “they should’ve come here legally” (don’t even get me started—you can read more on that faulty argument here). We either care about human rights—or we don’t.

James Baldwin wrote in The Nation in a 1980 essay:

November 11, 2025

A Harris County judge on Tuesday rejected Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s attempt to shut down a program that allocates county funds to help undocumented people access legal support.

The county, home to Houston, created the Immigrant Legal Services Fund program in 2020 and in October appropriated an additional $1.3 million to keep it going. The program sends funds to five organizations that help people facing deportation get lawyers.

Paxton had called the program “evil and wicked,” as well as unconstitutional. On Tuesday, a judge disagreed, declining to block the program.

The Harris County Jail leads the nation in ICE detainers — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to hold a person for deportation — as federal and state immigration enforcement has kicked into high gear under President Donald Trump.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said in a statement that this was a “clear defeat” for Paxton.

“The court saw this lawsuit for exactly what it was: a cheap political stunt designed to score headlines,” Menefee said. “Harris County will not be intimidated or pushed around by state officials who are more interested in pandering than governing.”

The background: When Harris County started the Immigrant Legal Services Fund in 2020, it was the largest county in the United States without a program aimed at helping undocumented immigrants get legal counsel. Austin, Dallas and San Antonio already had similar programs.

County Judge Lina Hidalgo proposed the program, which passed on a party-line vote.

“When you have a family at a deportation hearing and they don’t have an attorney, they’re deported at a much higher rate, like 90 percent of the time, compared to like 5 percent of the time when they do have an attorney,” Hidalgo said at the time, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The program sends county dollars to five organizations: BakerRipley, the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Justice for All Immigrants, KIND, Inc. and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Service.

Why Texas is suing: Paxton argues in the lawsuit that these programs “serve no public purpose and instead constitute unconstitutional grants of public funds to private entities to subsidize individual deportation defenses.”

He asked the judge to stop Harris County from disbursing funds to these organizations immediately, and bar them from doing so in the future.

Paxton has filed similar lawsuits against the cities of Austin and San Antonio over their support of nonprofit organizations that help Texans access abortions. In June, the 15th Court of Appeals ruled in his favor, blocking San Antonio from using the funds the city had allocated to potentially help people who needed to travel out of the state for abortions.

What Harris County says: After Tuesday’s ruling, Menefee accused Paxton of cherry-picking facts about the program and ignoring its “clear public purpose.”

“These are people who live here, work here, pay taxes, and contribute every single day to Harris County,” Menefee, who is in a runoff for the 18th Congressional District, said. “Making sure they can resolve their immigration status strengthens our economy, keeps families together, and makes our community safer.”

In a statement, Menefee and members of the Harris County Commissioners’ Court accused Paxton of using this program to bolster his conservative credentials during a heated primary for U.S. Senate.

“Providing legal support to immigrants who are trying to ‘do it the right way’ was never a concern to the Attorney General’s Office,” Commissioner Adrian Garcia said. “That is, until Ken Paxton decided to run for higher office.”

After the October vote to allocate funding for the legal defense program, Commissioner Rodney Ellis said in a statement that it was necessary because of the increase in immigration raids.

“Having access to legal representation not only improves case outcomes but helps keep families together,” he said in a statement, according to the Houston Chronicle. “In a county as diverse as ours, local government must step up to safeguard safety, justice, and the people we serve.”",http://media.iadsnetwork.com/facebookthumbnail/facebook.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 10:58:36.443986

The rights group said forced returns were taking place even as Afghanistan struggles with widespread poverty, climate shocks and severe restrictions on women’s rights under Taliban rule.

The call follows remarks last week by UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) deputy head Georgette Gagnon, who told the UN Security Council that about 2.5 million Afghans have returned to the country so far, a figure she said represented a 6% population increase that is intensifying existing economic, climate and humanitarian pressures.

In a statement, Amnesty said Afghanistan faces a “deepening humanitarian crisis” and warned of a “real risk of serious harm” to returnees.

The organisation said countries must comply with international law prohibiting the forced return of people to places where they face a real risk of serious human rights violations.

“Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran during decades of conflict, meaning many young people have never lived in Afghanistan,” Amnesty said, adding that both countries have increasingly pressured Afghans to leave in recent years.

Amnesty also cited media reports that Germany, Austria and the European Union are holding talks with Taliban officials to facilitate deportations, warning that many returnees are unable to find work, while women and girls face sweeping restrictions under Taliban rule.

“This rush to forcibly return people to Afghanistan ignores why they fled in the first place and the serious dangers they face upon return,” said Smriti Singh, Amnesty’s South Asia director.

The warning comes as several Western countries, including the United States and European states, have tightened entry restrictions for Afghan asylum seekers.

ICE agents drag woman across street

What happened:

Federal immigration authorities conducted a targeted operation near Karmel Mall on Monday, where dozens of protesters started throwing chunks of ice at them and shouted death threats, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Video that circulated online shows agents dragging a woman across a street. The crowd said she was pregnant. The woman, who was not identified, was released over safety concerns, authorities said.

The other side:

DHS officials say the woman who was dragged tried to vandalize a squad car.

The agency said officers abandoned their attempt to arrest her over safety concerns after protesters hurled chunks of ice and rocks at agents and deployed pepper spray against them.

What a witness says:

A witness who recorded some of the melee disputed a key portion of the government’s account.

""They chased her down to the corner, and they took her, and they were really forceful and brutal with her,"" recalled Taneka Dortch. ""That’s a lie. She didn’t rush. She didn’t try to vandalize any of their vehicles.""

“Rejecting the lease actually saved money for Key Lime Air because they will continue shared use of the common area for free.

Key Lime Air has been operating out of Denver since 2006.","The Denver City Council has rejected a resolution that would have allowed Key Lime Air to expand at Denver International Airport, citing ongoing concerns with the airline’s involvement with immigration enforcement flights.

The proposed lease, which was struck down 11-1 on Monday, would have reserved 1,200 square feet of ground space for Key Lime Air. The space would have been used for storage purposes, including employee parking, an office trailer and snow removal equipment.

Council member Kevin Flynn was the lone vote in favor of the resolution, citing financial reasons in a statement to MS NOW on Tuesday.

“Rejecting the lease actually saved money for Key Lime Air because they will continue shared use of the common area for free. It made sense to me to start charging them. In any case, they cannot be excluded from the airport,” Flynn said.

“I have been following Key Lime Air for the greater part of this year and have been monitoring what’s been going on with them, and I am very concerned about the illegal deportations that this vendor is taking part in at the Centennial Airport,” council member Stacie Gilmore said Monday. The airline is based at Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County, Colorado.

Gilmore added, “I think it’s an important stance to say that it is not an allowable use on city property, the city and county of Denver’s property, to have a vendor out there that is actively breaking people’s unconstitutional rights and due process,” Gilmore said.

Council member Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez, who also voted against the expansion, told MS NOW she is “proud” the proposed resolution failed.

“Our city chose to stand with immigrants and against the expansion of deportation flights because we know that our immigrant neighbors deserve a city that welcomes everybody, not one further invested in separating families and deporting members of our community,” she said Tuesday.

According to a recent Human Rights First flight monitor report, the airline made at least 162 flights chartered by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last month. The report also shows that so far this year, there have been 122 Key Lime Air outbound immigration enforcement flights out of Denver.

It is not immediately clear how or if the rejection of the lease will affect the airport’s Federal Aviation Administration grants.

“I have no interest in supporting this deportation machine, and if an aviation grant is what’s on the line there, it’s very clear to me where the city shall stand on that and where my obligations are to people in this city and around the country,” council member Sarah Parady said Monday.

Key Lime Air has been operating out of Denver since 2006.

""Troy will play a key role in advancing our Western Hemisphere strategy, strengthening cooperation with President Bukele, and ensuring the Safety and Prosperity of BOTH our Nations — A big step toward restoring American Strength across Latin America!,"" he added.

NBC News previously reported that Edgar was told that Trump planned to nominate him to the ambassador's post.

Amendments offered by moderate Republicans to the House GOP health care bill that would extend enhanced Obamacare subsidies with various other provisions attached will not get a floor vote tomorrow.

The amendments were blocked from getting a vote at a meeting of the House Rules Committee this afternoon, when the moderate Republicans argued that failing to vote to extend the subsidies for 22 million people would have consequences.

“There will be consequences if these amendments are not made in order,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., said at the hearing before the amendments were blocked. “I think the only thing worse than a clean extension without any income limits and any reforms, because it’s not a perfect system, the only thing worse than that would be expiration.”

Blocking the amendment leaves members of Congress with only one option to force a vote on extending the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies: coalescing around a discharge petition to force a vote on the House floor. The subsidies are set to expire at the end of the month if Congress fails to act.

Democrats on the Rules Committee urged the moderate Republicans to either vote down the rule tomorrow on the House floor, which would block the GOP health care bill altogether, or join them in their discharge petition for a clean three-year extension of the ACA subsidies.

“I hope my colleagues, my Republican colleagues who testified, including Mr. Fitzpatrick, will understand that negotiating with this committee, at least under the current circumstances, is not a prudent way forward to get this issue resolved,” Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Colo., said at the hearing. “And ultimately, it strikes me that really the only way it gets resolved is a couple of Republican members voting against the rule tomorrow or joining with us on our discharge petition. Because I think if we do that, particularly the latter, we can get a clean extension on its way to the president’s desk.”

The Democrats’ three-year clean extension of the enhanced subsidies has already failed in the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has said it would be a nonstarter if it came back over from the House. But Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, said he believes passing that bill in the House would force the Senate’s hand.

“I think if something passes here, including the three-year extension, the pressure on the Senate will be so enormous that I think the winds will change,” McGovern said.

Susie Wiles generally helps quietly shape headlines. She is rarely the focus of them.

That changed in dramatic fashion today after Vanity Fair published a deeply reported profile of Wiles, the 68-year-old White House chief of staff, whose decadeslong career in politics has been defined by a measured, steady-the-ship tone, never one that could be construed as undermining her boss.

In the two-part Vanity Fair piece — which included 11 interviews over nearly a year, with the White House’s cooperation — Wiles comes off as far more candid than her public persona. She not only speaks openly about both Trump and those who make up the core of his administration, but she also appears to acknowledge that at times she has been at odds with some of the policies that have been central to Trump’s second term. While it is not unusual for chiefs of staff to disagree with the presidents they serve, those concerns generally remain part of private conversations.

Wiles revealed there had been “huge disagreements” over implementing tariffs, acknowledged that the administration must “look harder” at its process for mass deportation and said she had to “get on board” with Trump’s decision to give blanket pardons to Jan. 6 defendants. She said she initially believed only those who did not commit violent acts should be pardoned.

Trump wrote tonight on Truth Social that he is ordering a blockade of all ""sanctioned oil tankers"" entering and leaving Venezuela.

""Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America. It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before — Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us,"" he wrote.

""The illegitimate Maduro Regime is using Oil from these stolen Oil Fields to finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping,"" he claimed.

Trump is ramping up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. has sanctioned three of Maduro's nephews and repeatedly conducted military strikes against boats from the Caribbean that it alleges are carrying drugs.

Trump is expected to sign an executive order as soon as this week that would fast-track the reclassification of cannabis and acknowledge its medical benefits for the first time at the federal level, four people with direct knowledge of the plans told NBC News.

Cannabis is classified in the same category as heroin and LSD under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Moving the drug from Schedule I to Schedule III would ease regulatory hurdles and allow the Food and Drug Administration to study cannabis for medical purposes, potentially opening it up for wider medical use by seniors, veterans and others as a pharmaceutical, irrespective of state laws.

The executive order would not make cannabis legal at the federal level, however.

Trump said yesterday his administration is “considering” the move. “We are considering that because a lot of people want to see it — the reclassification — because it leads to tremendous amounts of research that can’t be done unless you reclassify. So we are looking at that very strongly,” Trump told reporters.

A federal judge is allowing construction of the White House ballroom to move forward, rejecting a request by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to temporarily halt Trump’s $300 million project.

The preservation group sued the Trump administration last week in a bid to halt an expansive revamp of the White House property that has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats. The lawsuit alleges the administration broke ground before plans were submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission and without approval from Congress, as required for construction on federal park land in Washington.

The Trump administration told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon today that within the next “two weeks” it expects to meet with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts to review plans that Justice Department attorney Adam Gustafson told the court were not yet finalized.

Tad Heuer, the national trust’s attorney, quipped that with this administration, “it’s always going to happen in the next two weeks.”

Two nonprofit groups launched an ad campaign today offering legal information and confidential advice to help U.S. troops who believe they may have received unlawful orders.

The effort will include billboards saying “Obey Only Lawful Orders” and online messages providing links to organizations and information to ensure troops are aware of their rights and informed about their options, organizers told NBC News.

The move comes amid intense debate over the legality of the Trump administration’s military strikes against alleged drug smuggling boats in Latin America, which some lawmakers and legal experts say violate U.S. and international law.

“If you believe you’ve received a ‘manifestly unlawful order,’ you are protected by law and you are not alone,” reads one online message, addressed to “every U.S. service member.”

The White House said today that Trump will be in Delaware tomorrow to meet with families of the two American service members who were killed in Syria over the weekend.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced Trump's travel plans in a Fox News interview this afternoon.

Trump will be heading to Dover Air Force Base ""to meet with the families of the fallen and to receive their bodies here at home,"" Leavitt said.

Two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian U.S. interpreter were killed in Syria, and other personnel were injured, in an incident that the Defense Department described as a counterterrorism engagement. Trump wrote Saturday on Truth Social that “there will be very serious retaliation"" following the attack.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles reflected on Trump’s second term in a series of interviews for a two-part profile published today by Vanity Fair, speaking candidly about key players in the administration who have influence over Trump and some of the administration’s more controversial policies.

Wiles, 68, spoke to Vanity Fair writer Chris Whipple, an expert on White House chiefs of staff, 11 times over the past year about a range of issues, including the administration’s Venezuela strategy and efforts to slash the size of the federal government.

She also said Trump “has an alcoholic’s personality,” despite the fact that Trump does not drink alcohol, making a comparison with her father, television sportscaster Pat Summerall, who she said suffered from alcoholism.

“Some clinical psychologist that knows one million times more than I do will dispute what I’m going to say. But high-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,” Wiles said. “And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” She added that Trump “operates [with] a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”

The Trump administration is expanding its travel ban to include five more countries and impose new limits on others.

The move is part of ongoing efforts to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration. The decision follows the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.

In June, Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from visiting the United States and that those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.

At the time, the ban cover Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

Speaking to reporters after their classified briefing with Hegseth and Rubio, Democratic senators called for the unedited video of the Sept. 2 ""double tap"" strike to be released to the entire chamber.

Republican senators, meanwhile, said they were satisfied with what they learned from the briefing.

""There’s no doubt in my mind that we have the legal authority to blow up these boats,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said.

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told reporters that he was left with ""more questions"" after the briefing than when he walked in.

""What I did learn down there is they don’t want to be that transparent with us. There were six briefers that used up about 35 to 40 minutes of the hour that we had, and then we had 20 minutes for questions,"" Kelly said. ""So, of 100 senators in the room, maybe six of us got to ask questions of the group, and then it was over, then they left.""

""It’s at a highly classified level. I said that as soon as I came here. It has nothing to do with overclassifying it,"" Mullin said. ""This administration has been highly transparent.""

Trump annouced on Truth Social that he would deliver a live address to the nation from the White House tomorrow night.

""My Fellow Americans: I will be giving an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST,"" he said. ""I look forward to 'seeing' you then. It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the address would focus on what Trump sees as his biggest accomplishments of the year and preview what's to come next year.

""The best is truly yet to come, as he often says, and so he’ll be addressing the country about all of his historic accomplishments over the past year and maybe teasing some policy that will be coming in the new year, as well as we head into this Christmas season,"" she said.

Asked for his response to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles' calling him a ""conspiracy theorist,"" Vance downplayed the remarks, saying he had joked in ""public and private"" with her about being a conspiracy theorist ""for a long time.""

The ""conspiracy theorist"" comments come from a two-part Vanity Fair story, published today, in which Wiles shared thoughts on senior White House staff and Cabinet members. In the article, Wiles said that Vance understood that the Jeffrey Epstein issue would be a big deal because he had long been a conspiracy theorist.

""Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,"" Vance said before he listed examples, including masks for toddlers during the pandemic and questioning Joe Biden's ability to serve as president because of his age.

""So at least on some of these conspiracy theories, it turns out that a conspiracy theory is just something that was true six months before the media admitted it,"" he said.

While Vance said he and Wiles ""agree on as much as they disagree,"" he praised her for her loyalty to Trump.

""And you know why I really love Susie Wiles? It's because Susie is who she is in the president’s presence [and] she’s the same exact person when the president isn’t around,"" he said. ""I’ve never seen Susie Wiles say something to the president and then go and counteract him or subvert his will behind the scenes.""

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said that the administration’s accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James “might” be “retribution” and that “when there’s an opportunity” for Trump to take retribution, “he will go for it,” Vanity Fair reported in a new profile of Wiles.

Vanity Fair published the two-part profile today based on a wide-ranging series of 11 interviews over a year with Wiles, who rarely grants public interviews and generally stays out of the spotlight. The profile provides a rare look into the mindset of one of the most powerful people in the White House.

Reached for comment on Wiles’ remarks, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wiles “has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.”

“President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,” Leavitt said in the statement. “The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.”

Asked about efforts by congressional Republicans to reach a deal to extend ACA subsidies, Vance said it's on those members of Congress to ""step up"" and fix a ""broken"" health care system.

""The health insurance system is totally broken. It’s been broken for 15 years,"" he said. ""We think that everything should be on the table, but Democrats and Republicans, they got to work together and put something on the president’s desk to sign.""

Vance said the administration was ""talking"" with Republican Sens. Bernie Moreno, of Ohio, and Susan Collins, of Maine, about health care legislation, as well as some ""reasonable Democrats who are putting ideas out there."" But he reiterated that it wasn't Trump's sole responsibility to fix health care.

""Congress has got to get us something to lower the cost of health insurance for American citizens; the Obamacare system was broken,"" Vance said. ""Donald J. Trump wants to fix it, but Congress has got to step up here.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said today that he won’t call a vote to extend the enhanced subsidies, effectively guaranteeing they will expire at the end of the month.

Vance said at the event that the administration is trying to lower costs but that it won't happen overnight.

Blaming the impact of inflation during the Biden administration for a loss of purchasing power for average Americans, Vance said: ""It’s going to take a little bit of time where they really feel like that money has been put back in their pocket. That just takes a lot of time. It’s a lot of work.""

""You've got to lower costs,"" he said. ""That’s why we're lowering regulations on American energy to get gas and groceries down. Now, how does energy connect to groceries? Because if the truck that takes the groceries to the grocery store is paying out the wazoo for diesel fuel, then that means every American is going to be paying more at the grocery.""

""We do believe that if we keep on making the right decisions, we keep on investing in the United States of America, we are going to find that the American citizens can afford a good life in their country,"" he said, but ""Rome wasn't built in a day.""

Speaking to supporters at a manufacturing plant in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Vice President JD Vance blamed the Biden administration and Democrats for the affordability strain felt by many Americans.

""I'm a little surprised by when the Democrats talk all the time about affordability,"" he said.

Vance touted last month's job numbers, saying that thousands of jobs were added to the economy and that wages grew in November. The jobs data the administration released this morning showed that employment declined in October by more than 100,000 jobs before it partially rebounded in November.

""Private-sector wage growth grow at a rate of 4.2%. You know what that means? That means we're seeing the fastest private-sector wage growth that we have seen in this country in many, many years,"" Vance said.

NBC News reported that wage growth remained sluggish last month, with average hourly earnings rising by just 0.1%. Over the past year, average wages have increased by 3.5%.

The United States shed 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said this morning, lifting a monthslong fog that had shrouded the labor market.

The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November.

The national employment picture already looked fragile before the report. Jobs reports in June and August showed net job losses, the first time since 2020 that there have been two months of contractions before November.

September’s report, the last one before the government shutdown, showed a more modest increase of 119,000 jobs and a little changed unemployment rate of 4.4%.

Trump’s response to the death of Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, just hours after the murders were announced, drew outrage and swift backlash from both sides of the aisle. In a social media post, the president suggested the director was killed over his political opposition to him, writing that Reiner died “due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as Trump derangement syndrome.” NBC’s Garrett Haake reports for ""TODAY"" from the White House.

The BBC has said it will defend itself against a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump yesterday, which alleges the British public broadcaster defamed him in a documentary before last year’s presidential election by deceptively editing parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech.

In a brief statement, the BBC said it would fight the lawsuit, raising the possibility of a legal battle over whether the edit of the speech caused harm to the president’s reputation.

Eight alleged “narco-terrorists” were killed yesterday in U.S. strikes on three suspected drug vessels in the eastern Pacific, defense officials announced.

U.S. Southern Command said in a social media post that the strikes, among about two dozen conducted in the region since early September, were ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Three people were killed in the first vessel, two in the second and three in the third, Southern Command said. The boats were allegedly being operated by U.S-designated terrorist groups in international waters, and Southern Command said they were using known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking.

An answer is finally coming to a question that economists, consumers and even the chair of the Federal Reserve have been asking for months: What is happening with the nation’s labor market?

Emerging from the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release a long-awaited trove of employment data today: October’s payrolls and November’s full jobs report are both set to be published at 8:30 a.m. ET.

After months in a data fog, economists broadly expect to see net job losses overall in October, followed by a slight rebound and gains in November.

A majority of U.S. adults, 55%, say they will spend less on holiday gifts this year compared with last year, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey, highlighting how inflation has changed spending habits.

Only 9% say they will spend more on holiday gifts this year, while 36% say they’ll spend about the same. The results are part of broader data showing some concern about the state of the economy.

The poll found deep partisan differences in how Americans view the U.S. economy, with those differences showing up in holiday shopping sentiment, too.

(WTVD) -- A Raleigh father is sharing with ABC11 what he says he experienced inside a federal immigration detention center, and the health battle he says he's now facing.

David Cardenas Centeno said what was supposed to be a routine, annual check-in for his asylum case turned into a nine-day ordeal that ended in a Charlotte-area hospital.

""It's hard. I'm a human being. We don't deserve this. Immigrants, we don't deserve this,"" he said.

Centeno and his family say they escaped violence in Nicaragua and claimed asylum in 2022.

He says he and his wife have working permits, social security numbers, and believe they have the ability to stay in the country while their asylum case makes its way through the courts.

That's why he was shocked when he was detained by federal immigration officials during his routine immigration check-in on December 4 in Charlotte.

His wife, Cecilia Mendoza, says she and their daughters were shocked.

""My daughters started crying when I told them because, well, it's expected when you go through this heartbreak.""

Centeno claims he has no criminal record, and says he's concerned about what he says were the conditions in federal custody.

""There, you don't feel like a human being. You feel like nothing. You feel like trash,"" he said. ""There's one toilet, where everyone can see you, and there's 40 people in one cell.""

ABC11 asked ICE about the conditions in the detention center.

During his stay, he says he was also denied medical care. He tells ABC11 he is diabetic and has heart conditions, saying his pleas for help while in custody went unanswered.

""I finally got medical attention for my condition when they saw that I basically had fainted in the cell,"" said Centeno.

This entire time his wife says she had no idea what was going on, until she says she got an anonymous message.

""I don't know who they were. All they said was, 'Get a lawyer, he's in really bad shape,'"" said Mendoza.

Federal agents released Centeno from custody on Friday, after community members in Charlotte, where he was detained, pushed for his release.

Centeno says he was never told why he was detained.

""All they said was you're going to be deported. Maybe you'll see a judge, but that's it,"" he said.

Centeno says his doctors tell him he needs open heart surgery, but says he is still too weak to be operated on after this experience.

Still, he says he needed to speak out about what happened.

""If I don't speak publicly and stay silent out of fear, they could keep doing this to other people,"" he said.

Centeno says he was deported in 2013 for using a different name to enter the country, and says the Department of Homeland Security has not returned his immigration paperwork since he was detained.

Editor's note: All quotes from Centeno and Mendoza have been translated from Spanish.

ABC11 reached out to DHS and ICE, asking why Centeno was detained, why it apparently took so long for him to receive medical care, and how the conditions in the detention center are.

The Public Affairs Officer for ICE sent ABC11 this statement on Wednesday:

""David Cruz-Cardenas does not have lawful immigration status and was taken into custody. Shortly after his arrest, he complained of chest pains and was transported to the hospital, where he was subsequently admitted.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators.","Some Republicans in Congress are splitting from the Trump administration over its crackdown on legal immigration from Afghanistan, especially for those migrants who helped U.S. war efforts there.

Over the past year, the U.S. has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, among others. Those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.

Further immigration restrictions followed after an Afghan national was charged in the deadly shooting of a National Guard member in Washington, D.C., last month.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., cautioned against a ""knee-jerk reaction"" that could block a number of Afghans with valid cases for temporary or permanent immigration status from coming to the U.S.

""One thing we've forgotten is how important that is for our special operators,"" Tillis said, referencing examples of his own constituents with deep attachments to Afghans abroad. ""It puts them in a more dangerous spot if we lose sight of that.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also worried about the impact on Afghans from the cuts.

""There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops,"" Collins said. ""I've talked to veterans who have been very concerned about the safety of Afghans who have helped us. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting than occurred during the Biden administration.""

The GOP divisions come as President Trump spent the bulk of his 2024 presidential campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history.

Some Republicans have also pushed back against changes to visa programs for migrant laborers and in favor of more permanent status for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Afghan soldiers who assisted U.S. troops have, in the past, enjoyed bipartisan support for their immigration cases.

This included Afghans who had helped U.S. troops, immigration advocates said. Afghanistan was one of the top countries sending refugees to the U.S. in fiscal year 2024, according to Homeland Security Department data; out of just over 100,000 refugees admitted that year, 14,680 were from Afghanistan.

Some Republicans first raised concern about the pause's impact on those who had assisted U.S. armed forces.

The refugee program has since been significantly scaled back, and the target demographic for entrants is now white South Africans, according to the administration.

In June, Trump added Afghanistan to a list of 19 countries for which travel to the U.S. would be restricted.

And after the attack on National Guard members in D.C. around Thanksgiving, the Trump administration paused processing asylum cases, green cards and other immigration services for those from the countries listed in June's travel ban. It also paused processing all visas specifically for Afghans.

Trump has argued that those who came from Afghanistan were not properly vetted under the Biden administration.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the man charged in connection with the shooting, was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 under the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome program. He was then granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration.

""This animal would've never been here if not for Joe Biden's dangerous policies which allowed countless unvetted criminals to invade our country and harm the American people,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to a request for comment about the Republican divisions.

It is not clear what could have been uncovered through additional vetting before Lakanwal arrived to the U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the suspect could have been radicalized after coming to the U.S. At the same time, advocates have long criticized agencies such as the CIA and DHS for failing to provide resources, including for mental health, for Afghan soldiers transitioning to life in America after experiencing harrowing violence.

Questions about Congress's role

Immigrant advocacy groups accuse lawmakers of ceding their power to the president when it comes to immigration policy.

""Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight,"" Shawn VanDiver, the founder of the organization AfghanEvac, which advocates for Afghans who worked with U.S. troops, said during a press conference. ""Failing to modernize the asylum, refugee, or [special immigrant visa] systems. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fear-mongering, not facts; politics, not policy.""

Congress this year has passed very few immigration-related bills, mostly focusing on funding the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement efforts. Many other legislative efforts to facilitate or reform immigration processes have been at a standstill.

But some Republicans are happy to leave immigration in the administration's hands.

""Primarily, that's an executive branch issue,"" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, said about the vetting process of Afghans and other immigrants.

""Our staff are not the ones that are actually doing the vetting. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point.""

Republican leaders also appear aligned with the Trump administration on the topic.

House Republicans stripped a bipartisan provision from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have brought back an office at the State Department that relocates Afghan refugees. The legislation passed the House last week and is set for a Senate vote this week.

""Republican leadership tanked months of bipartisan work,"" Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., who introduced the provision, said in a statement. ""It is truly shameful that my Republican colleagues, some of whom served in Afghanistan and uniquely understand the debt we owe our allies, have once again put blind loyalty to Trump over American principles and obligations.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told NPR that one solution to the question of Afghan vetting would be to pass the ""Fulfilling Promises to Afghan Allies Act,"" which provides a pathway for Afghans to apply for legal permanent residency, following additional vetting, and is supported by senators of both parties. The bill was introduced in August, but has not seen a committee vote.

""I'd like to see the bill that I sponsored, which would have increased vetting on anybody applying here, to take effect before we make another decision,"" Cassidy said.

Still, enthusiasm to tackle anything immigration-related in this Congress is low.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators. But he told NPR that now is not the right time to restart that conversation, without elaborating on his reasons.

""It's premature to talk about that,"" Cornyn said.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/d74160c71d0348963a0d5ea1180d4585?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-12-17 10:57:53.750394

For IOM, it’s migrants themselves who should tell their stories, have their own voice, and be respected wherever they are.
Our role at IOM is to help the world see them clearly, understand their journeys, and recognize their humanity.","Mexico, 16 December 2025

I don’t know of any organization that shows as much humanity as IOM does in telling the stories of migrants.

I worked for over 17 years in international journalism before making the leap to institutional communication in humanitarian organizations. I believe journalism remains an honest profession, one that aligns with my conviction that storytelling is a fundamental human need.

One of the first migrants I met was a Japanese professor who had left his country disillusioned. Japan had lost World War II, and he had lost family and friends in the Hiroshima bombing. That event devastated countless lives and broke his unquestioning faith in the nationalism and militarism of early twentieth-century Japan. Years later, he left the country on his own terms and moved to Spain, trying to make sense of how his homeland had failed him and drawn him into a senseless war.

Almost as human as migrating is telling singular stories like his – giving a face to people while also sharing their past and context. Since 2019, I’ve had the privilege of being the Communication Coordinator for IOM Mexico, working with a wonderful team that strives to help our audiences better understand who migrants are, where they come from, what they long for, and what they dream about.

Our goal is to capture the pivotal moments in these people’s lives, but also what they value, what worries them, what they miss. Only in this way do we fully respect their dignity and show the humanity we all share, that connects us all.

There are always surprises. Once, I asked a man migrating through southern Mexico what his most precious possession was. He pulled out a wallet from his backpack containing a letter his little daughter had written before he left. He held it between his fingers and, while showing it to me, said he couldn’t read, yet that paper was his greatest treasure. It moved me deeply.

Moments and conversations like that shake our way of thinking, disrupt our life priorities, and affect our values. In a way, they reveal the depth of what migration means for human beings. It’s not just a phase – it’s part of their lives.

I believe IOM is a unique, honest organization. It can make a difference in the world of humanitarian communication because no other organization has the same drive or ambition to help us better understand those who migrate.

It’s not an easy task because the dominant narrative around migration is different – and we don’t control it. It’s often shaped by politicians who turn migration into a crisis, automatically associating migrants with “illegality.” And it’s often driven by opinion leaders and media outlets that exploit migration as a weapon and deny its deeply human dimension.

From 2021 to 2025, IOM’s Global Media and Migration Academy (GMMA) has worked in this direction with young journalists, content creators, filmmakers, communication students, and civil society partners. It’s been a valuable project that I’ve had the pleasure of supporting alongside those leading it from IOM Ireland and headquarters.

For IOM, it’s migrants themselves who should tell their stories, have their own voice, and be respected wherever they are. Every migrant is a unique person asking for a chance to let us know who they are and why they’ve come this far.

Creating space for migrants to speak for themselves and be seen for who they are is a simple act of humanity that helps restore their voice, their power and their dignity.

In a world crowded with misinformation and distortion, IOM’s presence matters more than ever. The stories it tells make a real difference, offering a clear and humane counterpoint to narratives built on fear and contempt.

Migrants, like everyone else, seek safety, dignity and a chance to build the futures they imagine. Our role at IOM is to help the world see them clearly, understand their journeys, and recognize their humanity.",https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl2616/files/styles/social_media/public/banner/alberto-cabezas_02-0.png?h=0e3678a1&itok=hG-kgmmq,N,,2025-12-16 22:57:34.741086

A neighbor tells KATU that a man by the name of Erik Tellez was arrested by ICE agents. While we were not able to confirm his immigration status, public records show that a man by the name of Erik Alonso Tellez pleaded guilty to Driving Under the Influence in 2017. The charge was dismissed in 2019, after Tellez completed Oregon's diversion program.

Wilson, along with District 2 Council President Elana Pirtle-Guiney, Councilor Sameer Kanal, and Councilor Dan Ryan, all condemned the report that ICE agents deployed pepper ball chemical munitions during the arrest.

In a video, which we obtained from a neighbor, you can see the deployment of what appears to be pepper balls.

That deployment came after a back and forth with people in the neighborhood.

Neighbor Jaslyn Cincotta says it all started when when in a man in her neighborhood was being arrested by ICE agents. She says he was on his way to drop his kids off at school.

As people in the neighborhood got involved, things escalated.

“When the one protester came, and came closer than they wanted, that’s when they started really, they pushed them back, they shot three or four rounds at their feet, then they pushed me out of the way,"" Cincotta.

She says more rounds were deployed.

""There's 40 or 50 neighbors, the kids trying to walk to school who all then got this giant wave of itchy smoke in our eyes,"" said Cincotta. ""My husband had to go and like get a glass of water for one of the middle schoolers who was walking by 'cause she, because the middle schooler couldn't breathe.""

I sat down with district two councilor Sameer Kanal on Tuesday. Kanal teamed up with the mayor to denounce the alleged deployment. The neighborhood where it all happened is also in his jurisdiction.

He gave us his reaction to the reports of the deployment.

""We were not surprised. We knew that this would happen because it's happened in other cities and we had brought in Chicago LA, DC. representatives to our committee of public safety committee a couple months ago, and they warned us about a few potential things that might happen, including the use of chemical munitions in the street, in L.A. in particular, and we've seen it elsewhere now in the Chicago area too. So, not surprised, still horrified. Still appalled by it, still outraged.""

Next year, Kanal says we will learn more about his proposal to ban chemical munitions from being deployed against Portlanders.

""In Q1 of next year, we'll be talking about how we can create these sorts of protections against the use of indiscriminate chemical weapons,"" said Kanal.

The four city leaders put out the following joint statement about the alleged incident:

“ICE activity in North Portland, including the recent unnecessary, unjustified, and potentially unconstitutional use of chemical munitions, directly contradicts Portland's values. As Portland's civic leaders, we condemn ICE's unjustified, disruptive, and escalatory conduct, which undermines public trust in government. We call on federal authorities to immediately cease the use of chemical munitions in our neighborhoods, wear body-worn cameras, and identify themselves when engaging with our community.

The lawsuit, led by California and Massachusetts and joined by 20 states including Washington, challenges a Department of Homeland Security rule announced in September that sharply raises the cost of hiring highly skilled foreign workers. The H-1B visa program allows employers to temporarily hire workers in specialty occupations that require advanced or specialized knowledge, including technology, medicine, and scientific research.

Attorney General Nick Brown said the fee would have immediate consequences for Washington’s public institutions. Nearly 500 H-1B visa holders currently work across the state’s public agencies, colleges, and universities, according to his office.

The effects, however, would extend beyond the public sector.

Washington is home to some of the country’s largest users of H-1B visas. Amazon welcomed nearly 16,400 foreign workers in 2021, at the program’s peak for the company in recent years. More recently, Microsoft led the state with 6,258 approved H-1B applications in the past year.

The new fee represents a steep jump from existing H-1B application costs, which typically range from about $1,000 to $7,600. Under the policy, employers would be responsible for covering the entire $100,000 charge.

The Trump administration has said the H-1B program is abused and overused, but state officials argue the fee was imposed without legal authority. In the lawsuit, the coalition contends the Department of Homeland Security implemented the fee without congressional authorization and without following the notice-and-comment process required under federal law.

“This was implemented by the Department of Homeland Security without the authorization from Congress, without the legally required notice-and-comment process, and in direct violation of the law,” California's Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Friday.

Some Washington employers have already put hiring on hold. The University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center have paused all H-1B applications, according to statements from the two organizations sent to KING 5.

Jay Gairson, an immigration attorney said the fee would place a heavy financial burden not only on major corporations but also on smaller and private employers that rely on the visa program to fill specialized roles.

He also rejected the idea that the higher fee would lead to more jobs for unemployed Americans.

""People that are struggling to find jobs are in our middle and our lower economic sectors,"" Gairson said. ""They're working in labor industry and in industries where have slowly disappeared and been shipped overseas already. So what we're doing by adding this fee is essentially transporting even more work overseas rather than keeping it here.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/11a292da-b542-4aeb-8319-b812f66f0325/20251217T014853/11a292da-b542-4aeb-8319-b812f66f0325_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 00:59:25.480324

A federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Seattle is the latest legal battle that Democratic-led states are pursuing over funding for EV charging infrastructure that they say was obligated to them by Congress under former President Joe Biden, but that the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration are “impounding.”

“The Trump administration’s illegal attempt to stop funding for electric vehicle infrastructure must come to an end,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a release. “This is just another reckless attempt that will stall the fight against air pollution and climate change, slow innovation, thwart green job creation, and leave communities without access to clean, affordable transportation.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has been hostile to EVs and has dismantled several Biden-era policies friendly to cleaner cars and trucks in favor of policies that align with Trump’s oil and gas industry agenda.

Transportation Department officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Trump administration in February ordered states to halt spending money for EV charging that was allocated in the bipartisan infrastructure law passed under the previous administration.

Several states filed a lawsuit in May against the administration for withholding the funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program for a nationwide charging buildout. A federal judge later ordered the administration to release much of the funding for chargers in more than a dozen states.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy later issued revised guidance intended to streamline funding applications for states and make charger deployment more efficient. At least four states — Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, and Wisconsin — have announced awards under the vehicle infrastructure program, according to Loren McDonald, chief analyst at EV data firm Chargeonomics, who tracks the state awards.

Tuesday’s separate lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, addresses withholding of funds for two other programs: $1.8 billion for the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant program, as well as about $350 million for the Electric Vehicle Charger Reliability and Accessibility Accelerator program.

The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California and Colorado, joined by the attorneys general of Arizona, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, and the governor of Pennsylvania. All are Democrats.

After returning to office in January, Trump immediately ordered an end to what he has called Biden’s “EV mandate.” While Biden targeted for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric by 2030, his policies did not force American consumers to buy EVs or automakers to sell them.

Biden did set stringent tailpipe emissions and fuel economy rules in an effort to encourage more widespread EV adoption, as the auto industry would have had to meet both sets of requirements with a greater number of EVs in their sales mix. Under the Biden administration, consumers could also receive up to $7,500 in tax incentives off the price of an EV purchase, a program that congressional Republicans ended last fall.

The Trump administration has proposed rolling back both tailpipe emissions rules and the gas mileage standards and eliminated fines to automakers for not meeting those standards.

Trump has also repeated incorrect information about the status of the federal charging programs; without all of the funds available, only a fraction of what was obligated has been spent so far.

“We had to have an electric car within a very short period of time, even though there was no way of charging them and lots of other things,” Trump said in a Dec. 3 press conference about the proposed weakened fuel economy rules. “In certain parts of the Midwest, they spent — to build nine chargers they spent $8 billion. So, that wasn’t working out too well.”

The lawsuit comes amid those regulatory changes and as the pace of EV sales have slowed in the U.S. as mainstream buyers remain concerned about both charging availability and the price of the vehicles.

New EVs sold for an average of $58,638 last month, compared with $49,814 for a new vehicle overall, according to auto buying resource Kelley Blue Book.

Automakers, meanwhile, have responded to consumers accordingly.

Earlier this week, Ford Motor Co. announced it was pivoting away from its once-ambitious, multi-billion dollar electrification strategy in lieu of more hybrid-electric and more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.

In the spring, Honda Motor Co. also said it would take a significant step back from its EV efforts.

For many in East Nashville, Wednesday was their first time responding to reports of ICE activity in their neighborhood — and they are aware that it may not be the last.

They gathered at bus stops in the afternoon, keeping a watchful eye in case immigration authorities showed up. Some drove home students who did not feel comfortable walking or taking the bus. Teachers called families with immigrant backgrounds one by one to inform them that ICE was in the neighborhood, and that their children were safe at school. (Activity had been reported at Sip Cafe, about a block from Dan Mills Elementary.)

While Christine Pulle and other parents monitored the bus stop at her daughter’s middle school, her husband drove around Inglewood, on the lookout for ICE vehicles. She returned to the bus stop the next morning during drop-off.

“I don’t know the best way to be effective help,” she reflected later. “A willingness to show up is all I have.”

Like the other teachers at her school, Sonia LeBlanc went down her list of students who are English learners (EL) and called their families, who come from all over the world including Afghanistan, Mexico and Somalia. LeBlanc said she returned to teaching after a hiatus to “be there on the frontlines” to support EL students, and she felt proud to see the community rally around that cause last week.

“Nashville is so big,” she said, “and then stuff like this happens, and you get real clear on that we’re just a small town taking care of each other.”

Some see last week’s events as a wake-up call for the East Nashville community. When it comes to immigration enforcement, much of the attention has been on South Nashville, which was the target of sweeping ICE raids in the spring. For many in East Nashville, Wednesday was their first time responding to reports of ICE activity in their neighborhood — and they are aware that it may not be the last.

But the need outweighs the resources and infrastructure available in the area, according to Heather Wood, a volunteer literacy tutor who works with EL students. Many of the organizations dedicated to supporting immigrants are concentrated in South Nashville. While the school district refers families to these organizations, she said those in East Nashville often don’t have the means or transportation to get there.

“It feels lonely over here,” Wood said.

After the rapid response last week, community members are reflecting on how to move forward and effectively protect their neighbors. Wood said there’s “a handful of people really trying to help these kids feel safe,” and hopes that people who contributed will stay involved. She noted there’s often a rise in response to reports of immigration enforcement that then dissipates when the immediate crisis is over.

She encourages people to get to know their immigrant neighbors. That can look like enrolling in schools with diverse student populations, asking EL teachers about ways they can help, or just getting involved with local public schools. She believes these personal relationships are “protective factors” that can broaden students’ networks of support among the adults in their lives.

“We need to be accompanying the most vulnerable kids in our community all the time,” she said, “not just the day that ICE vehicles get here.”

MNPS parent Colleen Fowlkes echoed the call for more people to get involved and pay attention.

“I think people will look back at this and maybe feel some shame or sadness around the part that they played — or didn’t play,” she said. “Especially when there’s people missing in communities.”

As a mother who “could not do without” her family, Fowlkes said she doesn’t feel that she has a choice but to be involved.

“I don’t think anything is more important right now than keeping people safe in our community.”

‘This is a safe place’

Efforts to share knowledge and resources about how to keep students safe continue across Nashville schools. That includes hosting “know your rights” trainings and setting up tables on campus with information for students.

Clint Wilson, principal at Glencliff High School in South Nashville, said he has taken steps to protect students’ safety that he “never thought I would have to do.”

One day last spring, he started receiving reports that immigration enforcement was in the neighborhood. So he got in his truck after school and followed a bus to an apartment complex. He drove around the complex and waited until all the students were safely inside.

The school “never had the need to do anything like that before,” he said.

“I can’t promise a parent, but I can tell them we will do everything we can within our power legally to keep them protected here at school,” he said. “This is a safe place.”

At Glencliff, teachers have hosted trainings in partnership with community organizations, including a legislative advocacy session led by AWAKE and an informational session on the history of immigration in Tennessee led by EdTrust. They have organized adult Spanish classes, led by Voces de Nashville, so that teachers can better communicate with families.

Sam Singer, a literacy coach at Glencliff, said it would be “heartbreaking” if the “idea of school becomes a fearful one for families and for students.”

“It breaks that community trust that is what makes a civic society run,” she said.

Partly in response to the reported immigration activity in East Nashville last week, Glencliff teachers set up a “know your rights” table in the cafeteria on Monday. Materials included cards that state what students could say or do in encounters with immigration authorities, printed sheets to share with relatives and neighbors, and guidance for families on safety planning developed by the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.

Providing these materials also felt urgent to equip students to keep themselves and their neighbors safe during the upcoming winter break, when teachers “won’t have eyes on the kids every day,” Singer said.

MNPS spokesperson Sean Braisted told the Banner there have been no instances of attempted immigration enforcement on MNPS campuses this year.

Under district protocol, if immigration agents show up at a school they should be directed to a principal or administrator and asked to provide identification and legal documentation. Schools are required to contact the district’s legal team to review any documents or warrants. The district does not release student records or information without a court order or subpoena. ICE agents cannot speak with or remove a student from campus without legal authorization. The same protocol applies to school buses, according to Braisted.

“It’s a time that’s frightening for a lot of families,” Braisted said. “All we can do is reinforce the steps and protocols we have and help answer questions as it relates to what schools can and cannot do.”",https://i0.wp.com/nashvillebanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Dan-Mills-Elementary-03-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-16 23:58:40.432230

“Accordingly, because Öztürk is likely to succeed on her claim that the government’s termination of her SEVIS record violated the APA, this factor weighs in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction. …

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced Washington sanctuary politicians refused to honor a detainer for Kamalpreet Singh, a criminal illegal alien truck driver from India, who caused a fatal multi-vehicle crash. Instead of honoring the ICE arrest detainer, these politicians chose to release this public safety threat back onto America’s roads.

According to local reports, on December 11, Singh failed to decelerate on a freeway in Washington State, striking the rear of another vehicle, pushing it into a third vehicle. The vehicle Singh directly hit caught on fire and the 29-year-old driver, Robert Pearson, died on the scene. Two vehicles were totaled, and one was left with major damage. The roadway was blocked for nearly 7 hours following the crash.

Singh illegally entered the U.S. in 2023 near Lukeville, Arizona, and was released into this country by the Biden administration.

“These demented and dangerous sanctuary policies have deadly consequences,"" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Robert Pearson would still be alive today if the Biden administration hadn’t released this illegal alien into our country. How many more Americans have to be killed before Democrat politicians start to put the public’s safety ahead of politics?""

In recent months, we’ve seen a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety and resulting in senseless loss of life.

Earlier this month, ICE lodged a detainer for Juan Hernandez-Santos, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico who is accused of causing a wreck while driving an 18-wheeler that slammed into another vehicle, causing a six-car pile-up, including with a school bus, on the morning of December 4, 2025, in Lacey, Washington. Local authorities did not honor the ICE detainer due to sanctuary policies, and he was subsequently released from custody.

In November, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for Rajinder Kumar, a criminal illegal alien from India charged with criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangering after he killed two people in Deschutes County, Oregon while driving a semi-truck.

In August, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a Harjinder Singh, a criminal illegal alien from India, following his arrest for three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida.

In August, ICE arrested Partap Singh, a criminal illegal alien from India, who caused a multi-car pileup while driving a commercial 18-wheeler in the sanctuary state of California. The accident left 5-year-old Dalilah Coleman with critical, life-altering injuries.

In October, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for Jashanpreet Singh, a criminal illegal alien from India, who killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.

Horrible Attacks on Bondi Beach and at Brown University: The Casualties Mount, and the Issues Rage

The scene of horror unfolded in one of the iconic beaches of Australia over the weekend when two shooters began attacking a group of people gathered for a Hanukkah celebration, part of the Jewish community there. There were some other guests as well, but at least as of now, 16 persons were killed and several others were wounded.

The victims included a 10-year-old child, a little girl, along with a rabbi and a Holocaust survivor. Survived the Holocaust only to die in this onslaught that unfolded on Bondi Beach. We are looking here at something that is now becoming a pattern. Even a pattern of recent days, not to mention a pattern of years, and as I’m going to argue, a pattern of centuries. What we’re looking at here is a far bigger question than many people want to acknowledge. It has to do with the openness of Western societies. It has to do with the conflict between the West and Islam. It has to do with the practical problems of mass immigration. And there are very few who want to talk about these things out loud. I think that that is our responsibility.

Now, the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal at least hinted at this in a piece they ran about various attacks and arrests made in various places. They mentioned not only the mass shooting there on Bondi Beach and Australia, aimed at the Jewish community, no question. And it is suspected that they were Islamic shooters, a father and a son.

And then you look at the fact that last Friday, German police arrested five men, three Moroccans, a Syrian, and an Egyptian, as The Journal said, “On suspicion of planning an attack on a Christmas market.” There are other things. And so you have other headlines that are all put together here, and you’re also looking at an attack that took place in Syria.

There are commonalities. One of the commonalities here is that you have an undeniable trend of antisemitism. It’s an ugly outbreak of antisemitism. And in this case, you have to say, “Is this politically occasioned?” I don’t think that’s a sufficient explanation. I think this is ancient hatreds. I don’t think this is just a modern development. And I think we’re going to fool ourselves and confuse ourselves if we see this as just a modern development.

I’m not going to go through all the headlines about all the attacks, all the outbreaks of antisemitism. I do want to go back to the three issues that I mentioned. We are looking at the fact that you have free societies that are increasingly unfree. And it is because you look at this, and even if the police declare that Bondi Beach is now fully open and that security concerns have been met.

And then you also have the president of Brown University having to respond to a mass shooting that took place. And it took place in a classroom with a Jewish professor. And in this case, they had a suspect. The suspect, we are told, is no longer a suspect, is now being released. That means that the suspect has not been found or located. And we’re looking at an undeniable pattern, and it is an assault upon the freedom of assembly. It’s an attack upon the freedom of free societies.

Karl Popper, 20th-century philosopher, spoke of the difference between open and closed societies. We could simply summarize it more or less in free and unfree societies. In a free society, in an open society, you have the ability, for instance, of Jewish citizens, friends, and family to gather on a public beach there in Sydney for a Hanukkah celebration. But the very fact that they were known to do that meant that they were also susceptible to the kind of planned, strategic, intentional, premeditated terror attack that was actually what happened there over the weekend on Bondi Beach and with such murderous results.

I don’t think most of us have come to terms with how this is happening so fast, even in the United States. Free assembly is actually being cut down, not so much by the government taking an unconstitutional action, but simply by the society itself becoming unsafe for that kind of assembly. Now, let me just tell you that on college campuses, the rules are constantly changing. Some of this is driven by DEI and all kinds of leftist ideologies. Some of it is taking place just out of a rational response to what could be defined as a clear and present danger.

So are ideological and political considerations here? Yeah. But whether you’re from the right or the left, the reality is the cost of holding a public event has gone skyrocketing high. You now have to arrange, in many cases, for security or for private police. You have to have screening. And yes, I think this has been disproportionate in terms of how it’s fallen out on the political spectrum. And you just have to think of the assassination of Charlie Kirk earlier this year to understand that that will require all the rules to be changed. Even if the rules aren’t changed, the insurance coverage will change. In other words, things are going to change whether or not universities and colleges initiate the changes. It’s going to happen.

And free expression, free assembly, the gathering of people together for the exchange of ideas, the ability of students to meet, the ability of just institutions to have any openness at all, to operate freely. How long is it going to be before every single school basically is behind some kind of military encampment? How long is it going to be before the cost of some kind of assembly in the public is simply going to be too high? How long is it going to be before, in effect, the freedom of Western societies disappears?

There are two other issues, and they’re going to require a lot of attention in coming weeks and months. As a matter of fact, I think we’re in a civilizational struggle, so these issues are going to continue for a considerable amount of time.

And one of them simply has to do with immigration. There is no way around it. This is a part of the picture there in Australia. It’s a part of the picture in so many of these attacks. It’s a part of the picture in so many nations. And you see a pushback on this across the political spectrum. And you also see it in some very unusual ways, perhaps you haven’t noticed. In the United States, for some time it was basically people on the Right who were making this case pretty loudly for restricting immigration. But you’ll notice that defenses of, say, open borders and all of this, which was a part of liberal discourse, that has gone dormant and at least softer. You don’t see many people even on the political Left or in the Washington spectrum, you don’t see many Democrats standing up and becoming vociferous, vocal, very loud defenders of unrestricted immigration. No. As a matter of fact, the Overton Window, as it’s called on that, has shifted significantly. The acceptable discourse now is what kind of appropriate immigration restrictions should be in place.

Now, one of the problems on the Left right now is that they will fight actually coming up with those restrictions. And a part of it is because their own coalitions are so fractured over these issues. Their movement on this is very, very limited. And yet the public eventually is going to demand a change to this situation.

That is happening in Western European nations. It has already been happening over the course of the last several years. It is a big issue in Germany right now. I mentioned the arrests of those who are suspected and coming from Islamic lands who were arrested in anticipation of the fact they were plotting a Christmas market attack.

Christmas markets, by the way, are an exercise in free economics, also free assembly and free expression there in Germany. They’re a very important part of the Christmas culture. And so this is an attack at the very heart of Germany, the very heart of German culture, the very idea of German liberty. And you see a clash here and immigration is a big part of this. And we have seen this, by the way, in previous attacks on Christmas markets in Germany. We’ve seen it so much so that I do not even dare right now to try to catalog them. The reality is the list is overwhelming.

The fact is that mass immigration, as many Western nations sought to undertake plans or policies acknowledged or unacknowledged on open immigration, they have led to disaster. Now, that’s not to say that they have led in every case to disaster. That would be an overclaim. It is to say the pattern itself has created a massive vulnerability within societies.

And one of the things that society requires, one of the things a civilization requires, is a commitment to the civilizational principle. And if you allow people who do not buy into, do not support, will not work towards your civilizational project, you’re in big trouble because you have just brought into your own country, you have just brought into your own culture, those who absolutely want to transform it, or at the very least, do not want to have anything to do with becoming a part of it.

And there’s more to this as we shall get to the issue of Islam, but on the issue of immigration, when you have immigrant communities that are multiple ethnics, that’s what some of the reference was to back in the 20th century. They simply do not become a part of the larger society. They see themselves as separate from it. That is a huge problem.

In Australia, over the course of the last 25 years, the percentage of the population who’ve been immigrants has increased from 23% to 34%. Okay, do the math, from 23% to 34%. That means that right now, one out of three persons legally in Australia is an immigrant. Now, that could be a good thing. I think we now know that’s not a good thing. It could be a good thing if all of those people, or even the vast, vast majority of those people, were absolutely committed to continuing the civilizational project of Australia, but we now know that is not the case. The civilizational project of Australia would include a welcome and protection of Jewish citizens there. We see that that is something this father and son definitely did not buy into.

Now, exactly what policy should a nation have? I believe a nation should have a national interest immigration policy. As a matter of fact, I’m going to argue that’s what is going to happen competently or incompetently in almost any situation. And so even when you look at Germany’s very open receptivity to a lot of migrants coming in, even from lands where they had very different civilizational commitments, coming in particular over the last 15 years, and specifically under the leadership of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, she claimed this is in Germany’s best interest as a matter of national honor. It’s really a matter of national duty.

And you see, when those arguments take place, as is clear in Germany right now, many of the politicians who put those policies in place, claiming this is right for Germany now, even over against overwhelming opposition in her own country, the fact is, as is the case with Angela Merkel, they’re generally retired from office before the consequences show up.

Part II

The Problem of Islam: This is Not Just a Problem of a Lack of Assimilation

But I have to get to the third issue here. It’s not just the loss of freedom in free societies. It’s not just the problem of immigration and the fact that incompetent, wrong, reckless immigration laws or the disregard of immigration laws leads to a civilizational crisis.

It is also, thirdly, that in this case, the specific crisis, we do know. We cannot honestly not know. Overwhelmingly, it is an Islamic crisis. Now, there are those who want to deny this, and they are absolutely determined to shut down any public conversation. And quite frankly, if you dare to talk about these things out loud, there are many people who are going to say, “You’re an Islamophobe.” That’s the current kind of language that’s being used.

But I want to go back to the fact that this isn’t personal. This is indeed civilizational. I am very indebted to Samuel Huntington back from the 20th century, and he made very clear that Islamic civilization is a very different civilization than Western civilization. It starts with a radically different theology, and it ends up with a radically different vision of society. And as a matter of fact, they’re so radically different, they’re irreconcilable.

And there are people who are going to counter that and say, “Well, look at Zohran Mamdani, very liberal, pro-LGBTQ, pro-abortion, pro all these things, and he’s a Muslim.” Yes, but I don’t think he’s a Muslim who could show up as a Muslim in Muslim-dominated countries and make his case.

That is to say, what we have in virtually all of the West are people who have accommodated themselves to a modernity and to secularism one way or the other. So you have liberal Jewish citizens. You have plenty of liberal people who identify as Christians, liberal denominations, liberal preachers, liberal bishops, and all the rest. They will endorse everything of the far left, but they don’t have any legitimate claim on Orthodox biblical historic Christianity.

And so you say, “Well, there are liberal Christians.” Yep. And you know what? In a Christian society, liberal Christians will show up in a way that’s not true about liberal Muslims in, well, you could name the country, especially in the Middle East, where let’s just say there is no real moderate Muslim population for good reason.

Now, we don’t have time to unpack all of this today, but we need to say enough, and we need to make very clear that a part of the central theological logic of Islam is territorial in a way that isn’t true of Christianity, has never been true of Christianity.

Where you have had, for instance, the claim that this is Christian territory, what it really means is this is where Christians constitute a majority and where a basic Christian understanding of human dignity and human law and all of this prevails. That’s very different than the Muslim understanding of territory, which means that in the Muslim worldview, the world is actually divided between the world of Islam and the world of war, where there is the responsibility of Muslims to wage the battle to bring those unconquered parts of the civilization under Muslim control, under the rule of the Quran. Now, there is no such thing when you look at Judaism or Christianity. It’s a very different logic, but then again, Muhammad was a very, very different founder.

And when it comes to people in the West, there once was a time when in the West you had people who were in office who understood the difference and understood the threat. But now you have an absolute naivete for decades on the part of many Western leaders who just assumed that everyone can be enticed to conform to a Western historic understanding of human rights, of the process of law, of the status of nations, of the ideal of citizenship and all the rest. Clearly, that isn’t true. It should have been clear at every single point.

And that is not to say there cannot be some persons who will identify as this or that who can blend in well in the United States. It is to say that we have a conflict of theologies, we have a conflict of worldviews, we have a conflict of civilizations, and to deny it is sheer idiocy. And it comes hand in hand, by the way, with those who are the cultured elites in the United States and Europe who want to suggest that Christianity had basically nothing to do with the formation of Western civilization, or that you can have a continuation of Western civilization with its understandings of human dignity and all the rest after having abandoned Christianity.

And the other thing to notice is that when Christianity is abandoned, it isn’t followed by a vacuum. That is impossible. It is followed by something stronger. When a weak theology abandons the ground, what follows is a strong theology. And understand this, Islam is a very strong theology.

All right, so many issues here for us to have to consider. Our hearts go out to the people of Australia and in particular to the Jewish community there, to students at Brown University and all involved. Unfortunately, the list is long, and the casualties mount, and the denial yet continues. It’s going to be very interesting to see where this conversation goes.

I’m not one to offer very many predictions, but I will say this, I don’t think this situation can remain as it is. You see right now enormous pushback in Western Europe simply because of those who are not assimilating into these societies. And over time, you had the liberals say, “Well, the society should feel guilty for the fact that this assimilation isn’t taking place.” No, that is not the fact. The problem here is not that the societies aren’t genuinely open. It is that there are so many people who genuinely do not want an open society.",https://cf.albertmohler.com/uploads/2025/12/gettyimages-2251954353.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 21:57:02.179797

LD 1971 passed in both Maine’s House of Representatives and Senate in the spring.
Immigrant advocates say the law addresses real harm that has already occurred in Maine.","A bill aimed at preventing Maine law enforcement agencies from participating in federal immigration enforcement, LD 1971, will become law when the legislature reconvenes in January. But it won’t take effect until this summer.

Gov. Janet Mills announced this week that she will allow it to take effect without her signature. It will take effect 90 days after lawmakers adjourn the session, which is currently scheduled to end April 15.

The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Deqa Dhalac, said the measure is urgently needed to protect Maine’s immigrant communities at a time of escalating immigration enforcement and growing fear.

“I appreciate that Gov. Mills will allow LD 1971 to become law, but I am disappointed that she decided to wait this long,” Dhalac said. She added that local police departments helping ICE “damages their relationship with immigrant communities, erodes public trust and makes us all less safe, whether we are immigrants or not.”

As amended, LD 1971 clarifies that state and local law enforcement agencies may not engage in federal immigration enforcement, while still allowing cooperation with federal authorities on investigations into serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and human trafficking. LD 1971 passed in both Maine’s House of Representatives and Senate in the spring.

Immigrant advocates say the law addresses real harm that has already occurred in Maine. The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP) has tracked at least 22 minor traffic stops since March 2025 in which people were handed over to immigration authorities based on suspected immigration status alone, including passengers, bystanders, children and accident victims. Many of those individuals were known to be in lawful immigration processes and had no criminal histories.

“In addition to protecting the rights and safety of Maine residents, this law sends a far-reaching message that immigrants are valued, respected, and needed,” said Lisa Parisio, ILAP’s policy director, “and that our collective voices and communities are powerful and we can make change.”

The law also bars Maine jails from holding people past their release dates based on ICE detainers, which are nonmandatory requests that courts have found to be unconstitutional.",https://mainebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DSC_0540-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 21:57:10.000852

“Alejandra Milagros De La Cruz-Quispe (‘De La Cruz’), a native and citizen of Peru, petitions for review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’) dismissing her appeal from the Immigration Judge’s (‘IJ’) denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (‘CAT’). … We deny the petition because substantial evidence supports the agency’s determinations and there were no errors of law. …

“… De La Cruz described a long and turbulent relationship with her ex-partner, Mauro. …

“In February or March 2012, De La Cruz reported Mauro to the police but was later told there was no record of her complaint. When she went to file a second report in September 2012, Mauro was waiting for her at the station, and he kicked and punched her once they got away from the building. The beatings and sexual violence escalated. When she again returned to her parents’ home, Mauro came with his uncle, a police officer, and threatened to kill her and take their daughter if De La Cruz did not return to him. It is unclear whether she indeed returned to him before she decided to leave Peru and traveled alone to the United States, leaving behind her daughter, whom she says she could not afford to bring.

“Mauro’s conduct formed the basis for De La Cruz’s assertions that she had suffered past persecution and faced a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of her membership in twelve proposed particular social groups (‘PSGs’), as well as a fear of future torture if removed to Peru. She supplemented her applications with country conditions evidence indicating the persistence of violence against women in Peru. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that the IJ did not clearly err in finding that De La Cruz failed to establish the required nexus, even under a mixed motive theory. The record, largely comprised of De La Cruz’s own statements, shows that Mauro’s abuse arose from intensely personal disputes within the relationship. The evidence certainly does not compel a finding that ‘the scope of [any] persecution extends beyond a ‘personal vendetta.’‘ …

“Contrary to De La Cruz’s contention, both the IJ and the BIA accurately recited and applied the ‘one central reason’ mixed motive standard. Nothing in their decisions indicates that they ‘prematurely terminate[d] the analysis upon the finding of another motive.’ … Nor did the BIA apply the wrong standards of review: it properly reviewed the IJ’s motive findings for clear error and legal issues de novo, as its decision states. …

“As De La Cruz failed to show that the record compels a finding of the requisite nexus between her alleged persecution and any statutorily protected ground, her claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails as well. …

“Substantial evidence supports the BIA’s determination that the IJ did not clearly err in finding De La Cruz’s fear of future torture speculative and insufficient to establish the likelihood of torture required for CAT protection. As the BIA noted, De La Cruz testified that she does not know Mauro’s current whereabouts and did not otherwise substantiate her concerns that he will rape, torture, or kill her upon her return to Peru. …”

Gov. Maura Healey demanded that ICE stop using Hanscom Field in Bedford for immigration enforcement flights in a recent letter to federal authorities.

The move comes as the Trump administration continues to escalate mass deportation efforts using contracted planes throughout the country. In November, ICE conducted the most flights of any month since at least January 2020, according to recent data released by a prominent human rights group that tracks the flights.

Healey called ICE’s deportation tactics “disturbing and anti-American” in her letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE. She accused ICE of using the flights to “sever” immigrants from their friends and family without due process.

During a major enforcement operation in Massachusetts in September, 63% of the immigrants arrested by ICE had no criminal charges, according to recent reporting from The New York Times that Healey cited. Only 10% had any past criminal conviction, and only 2% had a past violent conviction.

According to ICE, the September operation resulted in 1,406 “illegal alien offenders” being arrested. More than 600 of these people “had significant criminal convictions or pending criminal charges for crimes committed in the United States or were known foreign fugitives,” according to the agency. Federal officials issued multiple statements about the purported public safety improvements that will come from these arrests. They highlighted a handful of “the worst of the worst,” detainees who had violent criminal histories, but did not share detailed information about all the immigrants arrested during the operation.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

In her letter, Healey defended the many immigrants being swept up in enforcement operations who are law-abiding residents.

“They are hard-working, productive, and beloved members of our community that you have indiscriminately targeted for deportation proceedings. Many of them are in the midst of a lawful process seeking citizenship through Massachusetts courts. This doesn’t make our communities safer – it in fact makes us all less safe,” Healey wrote.

Last week immigration enforcement officers disrupted naturalization ceremonies at Faneuil Hall in Boston, abruptly pulling some green card holders who were on the verge of gaining citizenship out of line. This was reportedly done based on their country of origin. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu convened a press conference inside Faneuil Hall this week to harshly condemn the cancellations, saying that they “disturbing to the utmost degree.”

Between the beginning of this year and Nov. 30, there were 114 ICE flights that departed from Hanscom, according to a report from Human Rights First. This represents a 143% increase from the same period in 2024.

ICE does not own planes, but contracts with an airline broker that in turn subcontracts to several airline carriers for the flights, according to the group, which maintains a detailed “ICE Flight Monitor.” ICE also uses Air Force and, increasingly, Coast Guard planes.

ICE acts quickly, often flying detainees to detention centers and staging areas around the country before they are actually deported. Immigration lawyers have accused the agency of intentionally misleading them and restricting access to their clients.

Last month, a freshman at Babson College was stopped at Logan Airport, flown to Texas, and ultimately deported to Honduras within two days. Her lawyer says this was done in violation of a court order.

Human Rights First documented a sharp increase in the number of domestic transfer flights this year. November saw a record 1,026 domestic ICE flights nationally.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey wrote.

The Washington Post recently reported that the Trump administration will spend $140 million to purchase six Boeing 737 planes for deportations.

The total number of ICE flights has also increased steadily this year. In January, the agency only oversaw 534 flights. In November, there were 1,538, according to Human Rights First.

Protests earlier this month were held at Colorado University, Boulder, which contracts with Key Lime to transport some of its athletic teams.
“Rejecting the lease actually saves money for Key Lime Air because they will continue to fly out of DIA, and continue to use the common area for free,” he said.","Key Lime did not immediately return a request for comment.

It was a provocative action for a city under President Donald Trump, who has sought to punish cities and states led by Democrats that have challenged his policies on immigration.

ICE is largely beyond the jurisdiction of state and local authorities, forcing officials to seek alternative ways to express opposition such as California’s adoption of a ban on face coverings by law enforcement. In Portland, Oregon, the City Council earlier this month adopted an ordinance that would penalize ICE for deploying tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Denver’s decision.

The city council’s decision does not remove Key Lime Air from the airport. While it will not be granted a larger operating space, it will still have access to the common areas it already uses.

“It is more symbolic,” Councilmember Flor Alvidrez told POLITICO on Tuesday. “It sends a message to the airport that we are not going to support [Key Lime] going into the future, and also makes whatever business they’re doing more inconvenient.”

Denver’s actions could have consequences: City Council members said that rejecting Key Lime’s request because of its ICE activity could put nearly $90 million of the Denver Airport’s federal grants in jeopardy. A condition of the funding is that all airlines are treated the same by the airport.

The Denver airport is owned and operated by the city of Denver, but has its own CEO who reports to Mayor Mike Johnston, who declined to comment on the council decision. Airport officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Key Lime has come under scrutiny in the past few months after news of their work with ICE came to light. Protests earlier this month were held at Colorado University, Boulder, which contracts with Key Lime to transport some of its athletic teams.

Alvidrez said these protests contributed to the City Council’s decision, and said she hopes the city council’s actions will send a message to all airlines that contracting with ICE could damage their relationship with progressive cities.

The single vote in favor of Key Lime’s lease came from City Councilmember Kevin Flynn, who told POLITICO Tuesday he disagrees with the immigration enforcement that Key Lime participates in, but added that rejecting the lease actually makes things easier for the airline.

“Rejecting the lease actually saves money for Key Lime Air because they will continue to fly out of DIA, and continue to use the common area for free,” he said. “It made sense to me to start charging them.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F4e%2F6c%2F0d9eb734413ea16c9365d6719103%2Fdistrict-of-columbia-66245.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 18:57:53.755862

December 16, 2025 5:00 pm

WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed H.R. 4371, which would subject unaccompanied immigrant children to invasive body searches and prolonged immigration detention, preventing their release to loved ones in the U.S. Though the bill was narrowly passed, dozens of members who previously voted for extreme bills expanding mandatory detention rejected this dangerous bill, signaling a growing shift against the Trump administration’s extreme anti-immigrant agenda.

If passed in the Senate, the bill would represent a major expansion of the Trump administration’s mass detention and deportation agenda. It would also lead to serious — and potentially permanent — psychological harm to children. Over the last several weeks, this administration has attempted to cut legal services for children who came alone to the U.S. and to coerce them into abandoning their due process and anti-trafficking protections.

In response to this news, Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs, Equality division at the American Civil Liberties Union, had the following reaction:

“H.R. 4371 would be a callous expansion of President Trump’s cruel detention agenda, targeting vulnerable children. This bill masquerades as protective legislation but would instead subject children to physical and psychological harm.

“While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the Members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation. Now more than ever, we need our elected officials to speak out against the Trump administration’s attempts to strip children of their rights and dignity, and to disappear them into detention.”

The group’s volunteers have witnessed dozens of ICE arrests in Waltham, Paz said.","Immigration enforcement agents have become a common fixture around courthouses in Massachusetts this year — plainclothes officers idle outside in black cars, chat with clerks and monitor hearings to find people to arrest.

While lawyers say U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has long apprehended immigrants at courthouses, the numbers have ballooned under the second Trump administration.

In the past, “You didn't have a sense that immigration was always in the building. Now it's like that's the first thing you think about,” said public defender Antonio Vincenty.

The increased presence is not only in federal courts, but also at dozens of district courthouses in the state. Vincenty handles cases in East Boston, Chelsea and downtown Boston, and said he has had three clients arrested in court this year.

“We want those that commit crimes to be punished. I don't think any criminal lawyer feels differently,” Vincenty said. “But we want the system to work. We want the system to live up to its rules — to treat people with fairness, to treat people with justice and due process.”

Courthouse arrests in Massachusetts have surged nearly three-fold over Trump’s first nine months in office, according to ICE data compiled by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.

A WBUR analysis of the data found 386 arrests at 46 courts across the state — including 147 at the federal courthouse in Boston — from January through mid-October. That’s up from 131 over the same period last year under the Biden administration.

And the latest data is almost certainly an undercount. In East Boston, for instance, ICE recorded only six courthouse arrests, while lawyers and immigration advocates report having seen far more.

Suffolk County District Attorney Kevin Hayden said ICE activity has impacted hundreds of cases prosecuted by his office — noting instances in which defendants got detained during proceedings, as well as times when victims and witnesses were afraid to cooperate because of agents' presence.

“The ultimate concern is that it has a chilling effect on our ability to deliver public safety for victims and witnesses of crime,” Hayden said.

He acknowledged ICE has legal authority to operate in courts here, but, ""Do I wish they would stay out of our courthouses?"" he said. ""Absolutely.”

""Do I wish they would stay out of our courthouses? ... Absolutely.”

Assistance for ICE in East Boston

With immigration enforcement mounting, the Massachusetts Trial Court released a policy in May on how court staff are to interact with ICE. Court officers must provide public information to agents when asked — as that information is available to the public — but they can’t initiate communication with ICE.

According to the court rules, agents can enter court lockups to take people into custody, but court staff cannot assist in, nor impede ICE arrests. That was put to the test on the afternoon of Nov. 21 in East Boston — in an alley behind the district court — after Alejandro Orrego Agudelo’s arraignment.

Video taken by an immigration advocate in East Boston and shared with WBUR showed Orrego on the ground — shirtless, barefoot and shackled. Orrego cried out for help as two agents in black hoodies and blue jeans struggled to control him.

A crowd began to form, and a court officer in a white shirt and court badge helped the agents subdue the 27-year-old. At one point, the officer helped shove him into the back of a black SUV.

A woman in the crowd shouted: “Where are you taking him? He was released in court.”

One of the agents responded: “He needs to go to immigration court.”

Sandy Wright, a volunteer with the LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, was off camera, challenging the second court officer: “Who do you work for? Are you Trial Court? I thought you’re not supposed to be cooperating with ICE.”

In the video, a second court officer stood before the crowd with her hand up, signaling the crowd to stop, and made a phone call: “This is East Boston district court, we need assistance from Boston Police Department. We have ICE here collecting somebody and we have a large crowd.”

Nine Boston police officers arrived on the scene that day. The police report said Orrego was “violently resisting the agent.” The video showed him struggling, with his hands and feet cuffed.

Orrego was in court facing charges that included assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest, as well as malicious destruction of property and disturbing the peace. He’d been arrested that morning after a neighbor called police to report an altercation with him. A communication with court officials shared with WBUR says ICE had a “detainer” to take him into custody.

But the incident represented a violation of the Massachusetts Trial Court's policy not to help in an ICE arrest, according to Trial Court spokeswoman Jennifer Donahue.

She said in a statement, “Measures are being taken to address this violation.”

Donahue said the East Boston incident prompted the Court’s security leadership to meet with court officers across the state to reinforce its policy to neither help nor impede ICE arrests. She would not say if anyone has been disciplined for the violation.

The Executive Office of the Trial Court declined requests to interview Chief Justice of the Trial Court Heidi Brieger, who oversees all departments, and Trial Court Administrator Thomas Ambrosino.

Some scoff at measures that limit collaboration between court staff and ICE.

Retired ICE agent Albert Orlowski worked in immigration enforcement for more than two decades. He questioned how court officers could stand by while federal agents struggle to apprehend someone who’s resisting.

“Law enforcement agencies should cooperate with each other,” Orlowski said. “Assisting another officer — that's called professional courtesy.”

The rationale for courthouse arrests is clear, Orlowski explained: It’s an obvious place to find people facing criminal charges, and it's safer than most locations, as suspects typically have had to pass through metal detectors.

“It's so much easier to arrest somebody from a courthouse — when they're in a controlled environment — than it is to arrest somebody out on the street,” Orlowski said.

Spokespeople for Boston-area ICE and the Department of Homeland Security in Washington D.C. did not respond to requests for comment.

Evading ICE at courthouses

In a separate incident at East Boston District Court in late November, an 18-year-old high school student appeared for a summons. WBUR is referring to him by his middle name, Josué, as he fears retaliation by ICE.

Josué said the judge first heard the cases of non-Latinos, then called matters involving Latinos, all of whom spoke Spanish and required an interpreter. That’s when ICE agents showed up.

Local advocates outside the courthouse that day said ICE arrested at least two people during the proceedings. Josué said as he waited for his case to be called, he could hear the commotion and it was clear people were being grabbed as they left the court. He said he was afraid the agents would arrest him.

“For sure,” he said in Spanish. “But thank God, no.”

Josué said he’s undocumented and has been in the U.S. since he was 15.

When he walked out of the courthouse, Josué said the agents were distracted detaining someone else, and he managed to get into a car waiting around the block. Now he’s trying to keep his head down — he wants to finish high school, and not think too much about getting sent back to Honduras.

“God willing, that won’t happen,” he said.

ICE reported the highest number of Massachusetts district court arrests in Lynn, Woburn, Framingham and Waltham. At the Waltham District Court, west of Boston, an auto repair shop has a front row seat on the action.

Manuel Arias owns the shop across from the courthouse. He recounted seeing at least a dozen ICE arrests over the last few months as people left in cars or on foot. Arias said his staff filmed a number of the arrests, but they’ve become so commonplace that the mechanics stopped taking video.

“The way people have been grabbed has been savage,” Arias said in Spanish. Often, multiple agents grabbed a single person, he said.

In one case, a man bolted from the courthouse, he recalled, then ran across a busy intersection and got away.

Video from Arias, reviewed by WBUR, showed an agent giving chase, then giving up after the man jumps over a guardrail.

Calls for more restrictions on ICE activity in courthouses

In front of the Waltham courthouse steps, there are signs taped to lampposts: “ICE took our neighbor from this spot.”

“Unfortunately our courthouse has become an ICE trap,” said Jonathan Paz, founder of a group called Fuerza Community Defense Network, which monitors ICE activity in the city.

The group’s volunteers have witnessed dozens of ICE arrests in Waltham, Paz said. And in his view, the court system is bolstering the work of agents.

“Why [are] our taxpayer dollars, here in Massachusetts, being used to facilitate and better carry out these arrests in our courthouse?” Paz said.

""It's remarkable to see just how complicit this whole system is.”

This week, the 32-year-old Waltham resident announced he’s running for Congress. He’s among those calling on the state to put more limits on ICE activity at courthouses.

Paz said he’s waiting for the Trial Court — or the Legislature, or the governor or the attorney general — to keep ICE from interfering with people’s legal proceedings. They can’t stop agents from being on court property, but they can take steps to help people have their day in court without fear of being arrested.

ICE’s policy on courthouse arrests dictates that agents must observe local laws. Some states require agents to present judicial warrants; Massachusetts requires only a form known as a detainer, signed by an ICE officer.

State Sen. Lydia Edwards, of East Boston, co-chairs the Legislature’s judiciary committee. She said she’s in contact with court officials about the spate of ICE arrests, and is considering whether to propose rules requiring agents to present a warrant signed by a judge. A similar initiative was recently enacted in Illinois, as well as in Connecticut.

“While we require a civil detainer, I think it's worth us talking to the courts about what it means to require a judicial warrant,” Edwards said.

Edwards said any solution — even a state law — should have buy-in from court officials if it’s going to be properly implemented.

Another suggestion, she said, is to broaden access to remote hearings. Not having to go to a courthouse means ICE can’t arrest you there.

“I would love nothing more than for our courts to be a welcoming, safe place for justice, regardless of your immigration status,” she said. “That's what I want.”

As the New York Times reported, through a little-known arrangement between the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and ICE, passenger information from domestic flights is being shared with immigration agents, who can then snatch people from our airports, even those with various types of status that have protected them from these very actions in the past. It also marks a wider threat to all travelers’ civil liberties, due process and privacy rights.

The program, which began earlier this year without public notice, has already resulted in multiple detentions and rapid deportations, including 19-year-old college student Any Lucía López Belloza who was detained at Boston Logan Airport while attempting to travel home to spend Thanksgiving with her family. Any was deported to Honduras just two days later, despite a court order barring her removal. Additionally, DACA recipient Catalina “Xochitl” Santiago was similarly targeted at the airport while boarding a domestic flight and later detained for weeks despite her valid DACA status. The policy signals a sharp expansion of federal surveillance and coordination to expedite deportations.

In response to this news, United We Dream released the following statement:

“By quietly handing travelers’ information to immigration agents, the government is converting airports into ambush points where students, workers, and families can be detained without warning and stripped of any meaningful chance to defend themselves.”

“This is not about safety or security, it’s about supercharging an unpopular mass deportation agenda that prioritizes cruelty over humanity and due process. The simple act of traveling within the country should not lead to detention and exile. It is disgraceful that young college students like Any Lucía López Belloza, who was trying to return home to see her family for the holidays, can be detained at the gate and deported within days.”

According to reporting from The Minnesota Daily, a majority of Minnesotan Somalis are American citizens or are permanent residents.

In recent weeks, President Trump has gone after Somalis, claiming that “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota.” During a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump went after Omar, calling her “garbage.” He also said that he didn’t want Somali immigrants in the U.S. and that Somalia “stinks.”

Beth Davis, the communications lead for Indivisible NOLA, remembers getting an Instagram direct message in November from someone with Indivisible Chicago that she didn’t know.
This has turned out to be a boon as street vendors, many of whom are immigrants, find themselves increasingly under threat from ICE raids.
In LA, as in many cities, ICE hotlines where people can call in sightings have been crucial for dispatching volunteers quickly.
“These occupations will go on to other cities, but we are learning more with each city, and cities are becoming more united every step of the way.”","When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) set its sights on Chicago in September, Chicagoans sprang into action to protect their immigrant neighbors: teaching each other how to recognize and safely document ICE agents, setting up “know your rights” trainings, and distributing whistles en masse so people could loudly alert anyone in the vicinity when ICE was spotted.

In the months since, whistles have become a popular raid alert tool in other cities across the country – New Yorkers wear them around their necks to warn neighbors, the people of New Orleans blast them outside ICE facilities and Charlotte residents used them to ward off Customs and Border Protection officials. While strongly associated with Chicago, the tactic is actually one that city organizers learned in part from groups in Los Angeles. Its spread is illustrative of the many ways cities are helping inspire and equip one another in the face of often unlawful federal activities.

Rain Skau, a co-coordinator of the Fight Fascism campaign of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) Los Angeles, said Angelenos began to use whistles to alert neighbors about ICE presence when agents first started hitting the city in June. Despite the federal government’s claims that these raids were targeting hardened criminals, Skau described one of the first raids at a Home Depot as mostly snatching women vending food in the parking lot, stuffing them into vans as meat sizzled on the grills they left behind.

DSA and other grassroots groups in the city set up patrols of ordinary citizens to create a consistent presence at the Home Depots when day laborers and vendors were most likely to be out and about. (A September report by Rent Brigade found that Home Depot locations became “the most dangerous places in LA for immigrant workers”.) Volunteers passed out “know your rights” information, and when a tip came via a citywide hotline about an ICE sighting, the groups sent out patrols to document what was happening, collect belongings and get in touch with family members if someone had already been detained.

By the time ICE hit the streets of Chicago in the fall, organizers in Los Angeles felt like they had some wisdom to share. Members of DSA in LA began having informal conversations with those in DSA Chicago. “One comment that someone made was, ‘We’ve never done anything like this before,’” Rain remembered. “And what I said to them was: ‘We hadn’t either, before all this happened. We had never operated ICE watch patrols, but we were able to do it. And here’s the great thing: you don’t have to do it alone. You don’t have to figure out all of this from scratch, because we’re here to support you.’”

Sharing resistance tactics between cities

As ICE kidnappings spread across the country, so has this spirit of solidarity. Beth Davis, the communications lead for Indivisible NOLA, remembers getting an Instagram direct message in November from someone with Indivisible Chicago that she didn’t know. “I’ve heard rumors that ICE may be headed to New Orleans as early as Friday. Our chapters in Chicago are wondering if we can provide you with support and resources based on what we’ve been through,” the message read.

Though Indivisible is a national organization, this connection wasn’t orchestrated by national leadership – just organizers in one city taking initiative to reach out to those in another. “For an individual chapter that is eight states away to reach out is very unusual,” Davis said. “There just really hasn’t ever been a need before now.”

She quickly connected leaders from the Chicago chapter to those in New Orleans. Before long, Indivisible Chicago had sent whistle kits in the mail to the New Orleans chapter, along with an explanation of how best to use them, and Indivisible NOLA set up a “know your rights” training that the Chicago Indivisible chapter helped lead remotely via Zoom. About 800 people spanning a wide range of ages and ethnicities showed up at a music venue for the New Orleans training, pens and paper in hand for note-taking.

Another collaborator on the “know your rights” training was the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), where cross-city collaboration has long been a practice, sometimes orchestrated by national leadership. “It’s sort of a chain reaction,” said Sarah Whittington, the advocacy director for ACLU Louisiana. Lessons learned on the ground were passed from ACLU Chicago to North Carolina to Louisiana branches.

“Those relationships across state lines have been really important,” Whittington said. “We’re building depth and expertise. If Minneapolis-St Paul is the next place, I don’t doubt that we will be reaching out to Minnesota and saying: ‘Hey, here’s what we did.’”

It’s not just national groups like the ACLU that are leveraging longstanding relationships. Groups representing street vendors in different cities got connected in the early days of the pandemic as they faced similar health and safety challenges across the country, and many have stayed in touch since. This has turned out to be a boon as street vendors, many of whom are immigrants, find themselves increasingly under threat from ICE raids.

In New York, vendors have faced increased surveillance from the police and sanitation department under mayor Eric Adams. But while the guidance for dealing with local law enforcement is that vendors should show their identification, the guidance for dealing with ICE is to remain silent. As a result, it has become crucial for street vendors to be able to differentiate between city and federal agents. Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez, the deputy director of the Street Vendor Project, says the organization is preparing for the potential for increased raids by distributing whistle kits, based on advice from colleagues in Chicago.

“We’ve continued to be in touch throughout this time and build on those partnerships, just checking in with each other and asking: ‘What are you seeing on the ground?’” she said. “It’s also become like an emotional support group at times.”

Overcoming communication and surveillance challenges

These ongoing relationships and direct lines of communication are especially crucial because “the repression is so strong” that it can be hard to talk publicly about strategies and tactics via mainstream news broadcasts or social media, according to Phoebe Unterman, an organizer with the Echo Park local chapter of the Los Angeles Tenants Union.

While there was a burst of media coverage when ICE first began targeting Los Angeles, most of that (with the notable exception of independent outlet LA Taco) has dropped off even as the raids have continued, Unterman said, making it hard to stay on top of what is really happening in far-flung corners of her own city, much less another across the country. In LA, as in many cities, ICE hotlines where people can call in sightings have been crucial for dispatching volunteers quickly. But in places where that tip system is operating via large Signal groups or WhatsApp chats, infiltration by authorities is a risk.

Tenant unions in LA and beyond have thus relied on existing relationships to share what they’re seeing directly with organizers in other places. A lot of what works, they say, is having decentralized “cells” of volunteers across neighborhoods who can respond to tips about ICE sightings and get on the scene right away, since federal agents often conduct their snatch-and-grab campaigns in minutes. “The thing in all cities that seems to actually interrupt raids the most is when a neighborhood kind of spontaneously erupts and people are coming out in support of people [being detained],” said Unterman. “That has really scared ICE.”

None of the responses can totally shut down ICE’s ability to operate or end the raids, and just as organizers’ responses are evolving, so are ICE’s tactics. But one thing the organizers can agree on is that they’re better equipped to handle it all when they band together.

“There is something going on here, with all of these cities coming together and protecting our democracy, in a way that I don’t know that I have witnessed in my lifetime,” said Davis of Indivisible. “These occupations will go on to other cities, but we are learning more with each city, and cities are becoming more united every step of the way.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eff2df88048d62055db4cbbbf0a1e4884f1ef56/1131_0_6535_5229/master/6535.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c32a5a476e7f17ef0072fe7845787bd8",N,,2025-12-16 18:58:22.410930

But hours after he rejected any House action — and after a meeting with moderate Republicans who had publicly blasted him — Mr. Johnson suggested the decision had not yet been made, as lawmakers tried to craft a proposal that would appease more conservative members of the party.

“There’s a real possibility to get a vote on it,” Mr. Johnson said. “I’ve certainly tried my best to provide for that, so we’ll see what happens.”

His waffling was the latest sign of deep disarray in G.O.P. ranks over health care, an issue that Democrats have promised to make a centerpiece of their midterm election campaigns.

Most Republicans are vehemently opposed to the Affordable Care Act, but they have not been able to coalesce around a plan to replace it. And a small group of Republicans from swing districts, alarmed about the political consequences of allowing the subsidies to expire, had been urging Mr. Johnson to allow a vote on allowing them to continue at some level, at least temporarily.

After he ruled it out publicly on Tuesday, they made their displeasure with the speaker’s decision known.

“It’s idiotic,” Representative Mike Lawler of New York, who represents a suburban swing district, told reporters, adding that the decision was “political malpractice.”

Mr. Lawler was among the Republicans who met with Mr. Johnson before the speaker said a vote was still possible.

The fate of the subsidies was all but sealed last week, after the Senate deadlocked on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to extend them. With lawmakers expecting to depart Washington at the end of this week, there was little practical time left.

Then, Mr. Johnson on Friday released a narrow health care bill that did not address the subsidies. The moderates’ proposal to extend them had been expected to be brought to the floor as an amendment to that measure.

But on Tuesday morning, Mr. Johnson said that Republicans had been discussing the details, including how to pay for an extension, and could not reach an agreement to allow that vote to proceed.

“We looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve, and it just was not to be,” Mr. Johnson said at a news conference.

Even if the moderates’ proposal were to make it to the floor, it appears unlikely to pass. But the effort would give Republicans campaigning for re-election a way to show they had tried to protect the subsidies.

Some Republican lawmakers have backed two separate discharge petitions that would force a vote on the matter.

But both petitions would need the support of 218 members of the House to succeed. Democrats have instead been circulating a petition to force a vote on their plan to extend the subsidies for three years, but they would need the backing of at least a handful of Republicans. Even if any of those measures were to draw sufficient support this week, they would not come to the floor before the end of the year, when the subsidies expire.

Some of the moderate Republicans said they would propose their measures as amendments later Tuesday at a meeting of the powerful Rules Committee, which determines which legislation and amendments can come to a vote. But Mr. Johnson controls the committee, which does not have any members from that centrist faction.

In the Senate, a bipartisan group of about 20 lawmakers met Monday night to see if they could find agreement on a way forward on the subsidies, with an eye toward trying to advance legislation in January.

Organizers of the group said there appeared to be an early consensus to extend the tax credits for two years, scaling them back during the second. The group hoped to issue a legislative framework before leaving for the holidays.

“This was a very constructive meeting,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and one of those who put the meeting together. She said the group was united in trying to “prevent huge spikes in insurance premiums that will make insurance unaffordable for lower and middle-income Americans.”

Ms. Collins added: “The fact that the enhanced premium tax credits are going to expire hits hard.”

“Of course, we’re not going to release a top-secret, full unedited video of that to the general public,” Mr. Hegseth said after the meeting with senators, which was held in the secure briefing room designed to handle top-secret intelligence.

The briefings unfolded as members of both parties have raised questions about the nature and legality of the attacks at sea, and expressed concern that they were not being given adequate information about them.

President Trump has claimed the strikes are aimed at targeting narco-traffickers seeking to bring fentanyl, which he described this week as a weapon of mass destruction, into the United States. But lawmakers have repeatedly been told that the boats the military has struck since September were carrying cocaine, not fentanyl.

There have also been escalating questions about the rules of engagement for the operation, including the legality of the first attack, which included a second strike to kill survivors.

Earlier this month, a small group of congressional leaders and senior lawmakers viewed video of the Sept. 2 strike that showed a fiery explosion that destroyed most of a vessel in the Caribbean Sea. As the smoke cleared from the first strike, two survivors could be seen clinging to the hull of the capsized vessel, trying unsuccessfully to flip it and climb on top.

It was in that moment, according to lawmakers and congressional staff who saw the video or were briefed on it, that the commander of the operation gave the order to hit the boat a second time, killing the two men.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, was among the lawmakers who saw the unedited footage; he said he had asked Mr. Hegseth to allow all lawmakers to see it.

“He said he’d think about it,” Mr. Schumer said on Tuesday. He added that instead, Mr. Hegseth and Mr. Rubio, who is the acting national security adviser, “came to this briefing empty-handed.”

“If they can’t be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean?” he added. “Every senator is entitled to see it.”

Most Republicans exiting the briefing backed the Trump administration’s decision to limit access, citing concerns about the sensitivity of the classified video.

“If you don’t like the classification, talk to the White House about it,” Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee, said after the meeting.

Mr. Trump initially said he had “no problem” publishing the video of the follow-up strike, but he has since reversed himself, leaving lawmakers in both parties frustrated about the lack of transparency.

Senator Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, said he would try to force the issue by seeking to quickly pass legislation that would require the Defense Department to release the video publicly.

“I found the legal explanations and strategic explanations incoherent,” Mr. Schiff said of the briefing. “But I think the American people should see this video and all members of Congress should have that opportunity. I certainly want it for myself.”

Mr. Schiff and others’ effort would need to surmount considerable obstacles as Republicans continue to defer to the Pentagon and Mr. Hegseth’s decision to closely guard access to it. The annual defense policy bill expected to pass this week includes a provision that seeks to compel the administration to give Congress unedited video of the strikes as well as the execute orders that initiated the campaign. Mr. Hegseth did not respond to questions about whether he intends to comply with the demand.

Speaker Mike Johnson declared after exiting the briefing that the United States was engaged in a “noninternational armed conflict.” He echoed the legal rationale the Justice Department laid out in a memo that concluded that extrajudicial killings of people suspected of running drugs were lawful as a matter of Mr. Trump’s wartime powers.

Mr. Johnson said the cartels “operate with impunity, engage in violence and terrorism that presents a clear and present danger to the security of America and threaten other nations in our hemisphere.” The speaker added that Mr. Trump “has both the authority and the obligation” to strike the suspected drug boats.

Mr. Trump has designated certain cartels as terrorist organizations, and many Republicans argued that the strikes were lawfully targeting members of those organizations or people tied to them.

But Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, one of the few Republicans to call for the Pentagon to show lawmakers the unedited video of the Sept. 2 strike, said Congress was still trying to discern whether the attacks were lawful.

The Trump administration, he said, must “still deal with the reality that the vast majority of the drugs that are coming in and killing people, particularly fentanyl, is coming across the southern border.”

Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump must make the request for Congress to authorize the offensive.

“We spent 20 years without debate, without the authorizations, without the oversight,” added Mr. Crow, who deployed three times to Afghanistan and Iraq. “We’ve seen how this turns out. It doesn’t work out well.”

House Democrats plan to force a vote on two separate measures later this week aimed at stopping Mr. Trump from carrying out additional attacks on boats at sea or striking targets inside Venezuela without express approval from Congress. They mirror similar attempts in the Senate to force Republicans to go on the record on the campaign that has to date struck 25 vessels and killed 95 people.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the right-wing Georgia Republican who is resigning in January, said that she had signed on to one of the efforts to assert congressional authority under the War Powers Act. But she signaled on Tuesday that she might be reconsidering, saying she “was very impressed by the briefing we got today.”

In a social media post, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, which has carried out the negotiations, said the European Union and some member states had “persisted in a continuing course of discriminatory and harassing lawsuits, taxes, fines and directives” against American companies.

The United States had raised concerns with the European Union about these issues for years “without meaningful engagement,” all while allowing European companies to operate freely in the United States, it said. If the European Union continues these policies, the United States will “have no choice but to begin using every tool at its disposal to counter these unreasonable measures,” the U.S.T.R. said. It named fees and restrictions on service companies among the possibilities, and said it would use the same approach against other countries that echoed Europe’s strategy.

The post singled out potential European service providers that could be targeted by name, listing Accenture, DHL, Mistral, SAP, Siemens and Spotify, among others.

American officials have long been frustrated by the European Union’s role as the world’s most aggressive regulator of the tech industry. But in threatening such direct retaliation, the Trump administration is going much further to get officials in Brussels to back down.

“Our rules apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the E.U.,” Thomas Regnier, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in response to the post. “We will continue to enforce our rules fairly, and without discrimination.”

He added that the bloc will “continue to engage” with the United States on implementing their trade deal.

European authorities have in recent months signaled a willingness to dial back some regulation of tech to bolster economic growth and encourage development of artificial intelligence. But E.U. officials have shown less openness to changing key regulations related to social media and anticompetitive behavior that are often at the center of American complaints.

President Trump and other administration officials lashed out at the bloc this month after its regulators fined X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, roughly $140 million for violating digital transparency rules. Another investigation underway of X could lead to further fines and penalties.

“Europe has to be very careful,” Mr. Trump said last week.

Authorities in Brussels have in recent weeks also initiated fresh investigations of companies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta. That is on top of the billions in penalties that have been issued over the past decade against American tech giants for violating antitrust, digital privacy and tax rules.

The broadside comes at a fraught moment for the trans-Atlantic relationship. While the United States and Europe have historically been closely intertwined allies, the past year has strained that relationship.

Mr. Trump has pulled back from joint defense, insisting that Europeans need to spend more to protect their own nations. His global trade war has rocked automotive, pharmaceutical and other industries across the continent. And many Europeans have been shocked by the administration’s language — starting with a speech delivered by Vice President JD Vance at the Munich Security Conference in February.

In those remarks, Mr. Vance specifically criticized technology regulation, warning that “free speech, I fear, is in retreat.”

In recent weeks, the White House released a national security plan that lambasted Europe, insisting that the administration wants “Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation.”

That document argued that Europe was declining economically partly because of “national and transnational regulations that undermine creativity and industriousness.”

So far this year, the Trump administration has announced that it has struck 15 trade frameworks and initial agreements. But many of these deals are works in progress that leave major components yet to be worked out.

In fact, European officials celebrated the fact that they had not made major concessions on digital regulation — which they painted as a matter of national sovereignty — when they and the Trump administration struck a rough agreement for 15 percent across-the-board tariffs. But for Washington, digital restrictions remain a sticking point.

With support from the U.S. tech industry, the Trump administration has taken an aggressive posture against other government’s digital restrictions as well. The United States informed the British government this month that it would pause fulfilling a technology-related agreement between the two countries, which included more collaboration on artificial intelligence and nuclear energy.

American officials felt that Britain wasn’t making sufficient progress in lowering trade barriers as it had promised, people familiar with the discussions said. U.S. officials had been pushing for Britain to loosen its food safety standards, and had expressed frustration with Britain’s online safety rules and digital services taxes levied on American firms.

Matthew Sinclair, the senior director of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said it was “unfortunate that lack of progress in broader trade issues resulted in its implementation being suspended.”

""The U.K. should do more to address barriers to trade in digital services, whether that is taxes that single out U.S. multinationals or regulators wielding unprecedented powers without the guardrails that should protect companies against disproportionate or simply misguided attacks on their businesses,” he said.

Mr. Trump and his conservative allies in Britain have long targeted the BBC for what they call its liberal bias. The broadcaster’s critics, and its commercial rivals, have spent years waging a campaign to put ideological pressure on the news organization and to disrupt its public funding.

In his lawsuit, Mr. Trump continued that pressure, saying the BBC “intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers around the world by splicing together two entirely separate parts of President Trump’s speech” on the day that rioters supporting Mr. Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election stormed the U.S. Capitol.

The attacks on the BBC’s integrity and credibility contained in the president’s lawsuit are likely to be a difficult backdrop to the organization’s effort to renew its charter for another 10 years. The charter, which is the constitutional basis for the BBC, sets out its mission, purpose and — crucially — how it is financed.

That process began on Tuesday with the government’s publication of a “green paper” designed to prompt discussion about what changes to the charter might be made. The government will hold hearings and consider changes to how the BBC is operated.

Lisa Nandy, a Labour lawmaker who is Britain’s culture secretary, said in a statement that the BBC “must remain fiercely independent, accountable and be able to command public trust.”

The current BBC charter expires at the end of 2027, and Ms. Nandy pledged that the multiyear review will be a “catalyst that helps the BBC adapt to a rapidly changing media landscape and secures its role at the heart of national life.”

The BBC gets most of its money from a license fee that is charged annually to any British household with a television. It is currently 174.50 British pounds, the equivalent of about $234, and raises about £3.8 billion each year. That is about 65 percent of the BBC’s budget.

The public nature of the BBC’s finances could make it more difficult for the organization to settle Mr. Trump’s lawsuit with a payment to him, as some news organizations in the United States have done. ABC paid the president $16 million to settle a similar lawsuit.

D.A.T. Green, an English writer and lawyer who runs the Law and Policy Blog, said the president’s case, filed in Federal District Court in Miami, is weak because he offered no evidence of actual harm or that Americans actually watched the BBC program.

“This is not (or should not) be enough to win the case,” he wrote on Tuesday. “But that is not the practical strategy. The strategy is to keep the case from being knocked out until they have forced some sort of settlement.”

Tim Davie, the director-general of the BBC, who announced last month that he would resign amid the crisis over the edits to Mr. Trump’s speech, said in a statement on Tuesday that the organization welcomed the start of what he called a “public consultation” on the future of the BBC.

“We want to secure a public service BBC that is independent, sustainably funded for the long term, and meets our audience’s needs,” he wrote.

The organization has also said it will defend itself against Mr. Trump’s lawsuit. On Tuesday, it repeated that stance in a statement and said it would not comment further on continuing legal proceedings.

The BBC has repeatedly apologized for the editing of Mr. Trump’s speech, but it refused to pay the president monetary damages and has insisted that the broadcaster does not suffer from institutional bias.

“We strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the network wrote in a statement after Mr. Trump’s legal threat last month.

The BBC has argued that the editing of the speech in a documentary shown just before the 2024 election, while an error, was not done with malice, which Mr. Trump would have to prove to win a defamation lawsuit. It has also questioned whether Mr. Trump was harmed by the documentary, given it was only broadcast in Britain, not in the United States, and he was re-elected soon after.

For Mr. Trump, the lawsuit fits into his larger efforts to influence the direction of European politics in the same way that he has seized control of the political and cultural conversation in the United States.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration released its annual national security strategy, which declared that Mr. Trump wants the United States government to be “cultivating resistance” by helping what it called “patriotic” parties across Europe.

In the case of the BBC, those parties have long taken aim at what they say is a biased, liberal news organization. Mr. Trump’s lawsuit not only serves to assert his personal grievance against the BBC, but it also is in line with the interests of the right-wing parties he has pledged to support.

Ms. Wiles made the comments in a series of extraordinarily unguarded interviews over the first year of Mr. Trump’s second term with the author Chris Whipple that are being published on Tuesday by Vanity Fair. Not only did she confirm that Mr. Trump is using criminal prosecution to retaliate against adversaries, she also acknowledged that he was not telling the truth when he accused former President Bill Clinton of visiting the private island of the sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Over the course of 11 interviews, Ms. Wiles offered pungent assessments of the president and his team: Mr. Trump “has an alcoholic’s personality.” Vice President JD Vance has “been a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and his conversion from Trump critic to ally was based not on principle but was “sort of political” because he was running for Senate. Elon Musk is “an avowed ketamine” user and “an odd, odd duck,” whose actions were not always “rational” and left her “aghast.” Russell T. Vought, the budget director, is “a right-wing absolute zealot.” And Attorney General Pam Bondi “completely whiffed” in handling the Epstein files.

Ms. Wiles described her own reservations about certain policies in real time to Mr. Whipple, author of a well-regarded book on White House chiefs of staff, even as debates raged inside the administration. She said she urged Mr. Trump not to pardon the most violent rioters from Jan. 6, 2021, which he did anyway. She unsuccessfully tried to get him to delay his major tariffs because of a “huge disagreement” among his advisers. And she said the administration needed to “look harder” at deportations to prevent mistakes.

But she did not complain about being overruled and at various points said she “got on board” with the eventual decisions. “There have been a couple of times where I’ve been outvoted,” she said. “And if there’s a tie, he wins.”

The off-script comments felt reminiscent of a similar episode in President Ronald Reagan’s first term when his budget director, David A. Stockman, likewise gave a series of interviews to what was then called The Atlantic Monthly with candid observations that caused a huge stir.

While Mr. Stockman kept his interviews secret from the White House (and nearly got fired), the broader Trump team cooperated with Vanity Fair. Mr. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave interviews and along with top aides like Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt posed for glamour photographs by Christopher Anderson.

Ms. Wiles, a low-key Florida political strategist who ran Mr. Trump’s successful comeback campaign last year, has been the president’s most important aide this term, credited with running a more disciplined operation than he had in his chaotic first term. He has embraced her so much that he referred to her during a rally last week as “Susie Trump.”

But the White House under Ms. Wiles is chaotic too, just in a different way. Unlike John F. Kelly, the president’s longest serving chief of staff in his first term, who saw his job as trying to prevent what he considered radical, unwise or even illegal actions, Ms. Wiles does not view her role as constraining Mr. Trump. Instead, she makes clear that her mission is to facilitate his desires even if she sometimes thinks he is going too far.

She attributes her ability to work for Mr. Trump to growing up with an alcoholic father, the sportscaster Pat Summerall. “High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,” she said. “And so I’m a little bit of an expert in big personalities.” While Mr. Trump does not drink, she said he has “an alcoholic’s personality” and operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”

In a sign of how much her job revolves around the president’s big-personality, stream-of-consciousness public comments, she keeps a free-standing video monitor next to the fireplace in her West Wing office with a live feed of Mr. Trump’s social media posts.

The president’s fixation on payback against his enemies offers a case study. Ms. Wiles confided in Mr. Whipple in March that she had told Mr. Trump that his presidency was not supposed to be a retribution tour.

“We have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over,” she said then. When that did not happen by August, she told Mr. Whipple that “I don’t think he’s on a retribution tour” but said that he was aiming at people who did “bad things” in coming after him. “In some cases, it may look like retribution,” she said. “And there may be an element of that from time to time. Who would blame him? Not me.”

Among the targets, she acknowledged, was Letitia James, the New York attorney general, who won a civil court verdict against Mr. Trump for business fraud with a penalty of nearly $500 million. “Well, that might be the one retribution,” Ms. Wiles said. Did she advise Mr. Trump to back off? “Not on her. She had a half a billion dollars of his money.” (An appeals court later threw out the penalty as excessive but left the verdict intact.)

As for James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director who was fired by Mr. Trump while leading an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Ms. Wiles said, “I mean, people could think it does look vindictive. I can’t tell you why you shouldn’t think that.” She added: “I don’t think he wakes up thinking about retribution. But when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it.”

The Trump administration has brought indictments against Ms. James and Mr. Comey, but both were dismissed by a federal judge. The administration has vowed to keep trying, but two grand juries have since refused to re-indict Ms. James and another judge issued a ruling that will make it harder to pursue Mr. Comey.

Reached for comment on Monday evening, Ms. Wiles played down Mr. Trump’s personal motivations in the actions against his enemies. “It’s not that he thinks they wronged him, although they did,” she told The New York Times. “He thinks that they wronged, and they should not be able to do to somebody else what they did to him and the way that you could cure that, at least potentially, is to expose what was done.”

She added that she wanted to get that over with early in the term. “You don’t want it to get in the way of the real agenda,” she said. “And so, loosely, let’s get it all going within 90 days. Which we did. Now, the justice system works slowly and so even if it was initiated in 90 days, it could be a long time before it’s done.”

In the interviews published by Vanity Fair, Ms. Wiles faulted Ms. Bondi, one of her closest friends in the administration, for her early handling of the Epstein files, an issue that has been a cause célèbre for Mr. Trump’s right-wing base.

“I think she completely whiffed on appreciating that that was the very targeted group that cared about this,” Ms. Wiles said. “First, she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk. There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn’t on her desk.” Mr. Vance, by contrast, understood the sensitivity because he himself was “a conspiracy theorist,” she said.

Ms. Wiles said she has read the Epstein documents and acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s name is in them. “We know he’s in the file,” she said. “And he’s not in the file doing anything awful.”

But neither, apparently, is Mr. Clinton. Asked about Mr. Trump’s claims going back years that Mr. Clinton had visited the Epstein island, Ms. Wiles said, “There is no evidence.” Asked if there was anything incriminating about Mr. Clinton in the files, as Mr. Trump has suggested, she said, “The president was wrong about that.”

She added that it was Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche’s idea to go interview Mr. Epstein’s convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, in prison and that the president did not know that she would be transferred to a minimum-security prison camp. “The president was ticked,” she said. “The president was mighty unhappy. I don’t know why they moved her. Neither does the president.”

Ms. Wiles described frustration with Mr. Musk, the billionaire who early in the year was empowered to eviscerate federal agencies and fire employees en masse with almost no process. “He’s an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are. You know, it’s not helpful, but he is his own person.” When he shared a post saying that Stalin, Mao and Hitler didn’t murder millions, their public sector workers did, Ms. Wiles said, “I think that’s when he’s microdosing.” Asked what she meant, she said, “he’s an avowed ketamine” user.

Mr. Musk has acknowledged trying ketamine “a few years ago,” but denied reports of more recent use. In the interview with The Times on Monday, Ms. Wiles took issue with the quote attributed to her about his drug use. “That’s ridiculous,” she said. “I wouldn’t have said it and I wouldn’t know.” But Mr. Whipple played a tape for The Times in which she could be heard saying it.

Mr. Musk’s demolition of the U.S. Agency for International Development including its lifesaving aid to impoverished people around the globe upset Ms. Wiles. “I was initially aghast,” she told Mr. Whipple. “Because I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to U.S.A.I.D. believed, as I did, that they do very good work.”

Mr. Musk’s approach was “not the way I would do it.” She said she called Mr. Musk on the carpet. “You can’t just lock people out of their offices,” she recalled telling him. She said that Mr. Musk was a disrupter. “But no rational person could think the U.S.A.I.D. process was a good one. Nobody.”

She offered no objection to Mr. Trump’s saber rattling against Venezuela and bombing of boats carrying alleged drug traffickers, suggesting that regime change against President Nicolás Maduro was Mr. Trump’s real goal. “He wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle,” she said. “And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.”

She acknowledged that Mr. Trump, who lately has talked about mounting “land strikes” in Venezuela or elsewhere in the region, would need congressional authorization for that. “If he were to authorize some activity on land, then you’d have to, then it’s war, then Congress,” she said.

Ms. Wiles expressed misgivings about how the roundup of immigrants has been carried out at times. “I will concede that we’ve got to look harder at our process for deportation,” she said. Criminals should be deported, she added. “But if there is a question, I think our process has to lean toward a double-check.” When two mothers were arrested and deported with their children after voluntarily attending routine immigration meetings, she said, “I can’t understand how you make that mistake, but somebody did.”

She acknowledged sharp internal divisions over Mr. Trump’s announcement of major tariffs last spring. “There was a huge disagreement over whether” tariffs were “a good idea,” she said. “We told Donald Trump, ‘Hey, let’s not talk about tariffs today. Let’s wait until we have the team in complete unity and then we’ll do it.’” But he announced them anyway and “it’s been more painful than I expected.”

Ms. Wiles confirmed that she wants Mr. Trump to talk more about the economy and less about Saudi Arabia. She denied that he would use the military to influence the midterm elections and ruled out his running again in 2028. His comments about seeking an unconstitutional third term are “100 percent” about “driving people crazy.”

As for the potential successors, Mr. Vance and Mr. Rubio, she distinguished how each of them came around to supporting Mr. Trump after initially opposing him. “Marco was not the sort of person that would violate his principles,” she said. “He just won’t. And so he had to get there.” As for Mr. Vance, “his conversion came when he was running for the Senate. And I think his conversion was a little bit more, sort of political.”

Mr. Rubio told Mr. Whipple what he has said publicly, that “if JD Vance runs for president, he’s going to be our nominee and I’ll be one of the first people to support him.”

Still, the underlying tension came through when Mr. Vance posed for the magazine’s photographer. “I’ll give you $100 for every person you make look really shitty compared to me,” Mr. Vance joked. “And $1,000 if it’s Marco.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/16/multimedia/16trump-news-promo-4pm-hmzj/16trump-news-promo-4pm-hmzj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 16:57:47.746116

The Wichita Eagle

WICHITA, Kan. — A 23-year-old man was given the maximum sentence — 20 years in prison — after he “intentionally assaulted and strangled” an on-duty Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation officer in Wichita, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Kansas.

“Violence against law enforcement is completely unacceptable and will be dealt with very seriously,” U.S. Attorney Ryan Kriegshauser said in the release.

According to court documents Diego Barron-Esquivel, who was described as a Mexican national in the release, “did intentionally and forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate and interfere with” an ICE agent during an altercation on Feb. 28. As a result, the officer was injured, the press release read.

Barron-Esquivel was arrested on March 21 and pleaded guilty in September to forcibly assaulting a federal officer. Court documents show that he asked for leniency.

“ ... I am prepared to accept any punishment permitted by law which the Court sees fit to impose. However, I respectfully request the Court to consider, in mitigation of punishment, that I have voluntarily entered a plea of Guilty,” his guilty plea petition read.

On Dec. 4, a judge sentenced Barron-Esquivel to the maximum penalty: 20 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release.

Court documents suggest that after Barron-Esquivel completes his sentence, he will be “released to the custody of a duly authorized immigration official for removal proceedings in accordance with the immigration laws.”

“And if removed from this country he shall remain outside the United States unless legally authorized to re-enter. Upon which the defendant must report to the nearest probation office within 72 hours after re-entry,” court records read.

According to Barron-Esquivel’s guilty plea petition, he indicated that he understood that conviction of a criminal offense may result in deportation from the United States, “exclusion from admission to the United States, and/or denial of naturalization.”",https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c41994/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+500/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F59%2F409e47bd483bbfc5d195c99498b7%2Fap25027710663013.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 19:57:11.066977

On November 26, 2025, two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot near the White House in Washington D.C. One of the victims, Sarah Beckstrom, tragically passed away the next evening. The suspected shooter was Rahmanulla Lankanwal, an Afghan national who arrived in the United States in September 2021 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, the US mission to evacuate and resettle vulnerable Afghans. The event caused a sudden reconsideration of the US evacuation efforts in Afghanistan in 2021.

Lankanwal had previously worked with the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan and was granted discretionary parole, on a temporary basis, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, at 8 USC § 1182(d)(5). He resettled in Washington, where he reportedly struggled to assimilate and suffered from mental health concerns. In December of last year, Lankanwal applied for asylum, which he was granted last April.

On November 27, President Trump held up a photograph of the famous C-17 flight, call sign Reach 871, that evacuated over 800 Afghans from Kabul in August 2021. Previously considered an image of heroism (the aircrew received Distinguished Flying Crosses for the flight), Trump framed it representing strategic blunder. Further, the Trump Administration promised rapid and substantial reform to immigration policies, committing to a sort of “reverse migration.” This would include steps such as a permanent pause on migration “from all Third World Countries,” removals, and a “re-examination” of previous admission and asylum decisions. When the Wall Street Journal cautioned against blaming all Afghan refugees for the act of one man, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff openly disagreed.

Much has been made of the vetting process applied to Afghan evacuees. That process is beyond the scope of this post. Vetting is, of course, an important component to evacuation and resettlement. However, in addressing the strategic decision to evacuate Afghans, it is perhaps worth reviewing what happened in the late summer of 2021, and more importantly, why the United States and its allies responded the way they did.

Evacuation from Kabul

Since 2021 nearly 200,000 Afghans have been admitted into the United States. These admissions primarily occurred through three different pathways: (1) Bespoke legislation, (2) refugee admissions, and (3) discretionary parole.

Legislation

The Afghan Allies Protection Act (AAPA), Pub L 111-8, 123 Stat 807, created the special immigrant visa (SIV) for Afghan nationals who provided “faithful and valuable service” to the United States Government in Afghanistan. The AAPA has been amended many times, and for various reasons, the SIV process was notorious for its delays. It was, according to former Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, “designed to be a slow process.” Thus, when the Taliban took control of Kabul on August 15, 2021, there were still approximately 70,000 SIV applicants in Afghanistan. These Afghans had worked side-by-side with US Forces and were now at great risk of retaliatory attacks precisely because of that work. US Government officials at the time stated the United States held “a responsibility and an obligation to help the men and women who served by our sides.” But given the AAPA’s statutory process, and the immediate threat to the Afghans, US officials looked to other options.

Refugee Admissions

In August 2021 the Department of State created a Priority 2 Designation for Afghans who could demonstrate a history of serving the United States, but fell short of the SIV qualifications. The designation granted prioritized access and allowed admission outside the established refugee quota. However, Afghans could only apply from a third country. This and other requirements made it less useful as a response to the chaotic evacuation in August 2021. Thus, parole became the primary mechanism for Afghans to be admitted to the United States under emergency circumstances.

Discretionary Parole

Operation Allies Welcome brought 84,000 Afghans to the United States in 2021, most of whom were granted parole, including Lankanwal. This parole is granted for “urgent humanitarian reasons,” as it was similarly used to admit more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees in 1975, and thousands of Iraqi Kurds in 1996, and Kosovar Albanians in 1999. As it reads today, the INA does not define “urgent humanitarian” but instead grants broad discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security. In application, similar to the experience in Vietnam, the tactical decisions of who qualified for parole were left primarily to US Consular officers and US military members on the ground in Kabul. They were given some direction to identify those who “could be approvable” for the SIV, or who could otherwise “show some nexus” to “American programs and projects” in Afghanistan. Admittedly, grants of parole were rushed, but unlike in Vietnam, the SIV program provided some framework for parole decisions. Ultimately, all three avenues for admission were primarily granted through processes meant to identify Afghans with demonstrated loyalty and service to the United States.

The United States was not alone in this effort. In total, 51 countries contributed to the war in Afghanistan and assisted US led efforts. Nearly all of them similarly accepted Afghan nationals in the days and weeks following the fall of Kabul. Some created bespoke legislation or visa programs, similar to the SIV program, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, South Korea and Denmark, among others. However, most US allies chose to admit Afghan nationals in 2021 under discretionary admission authorities, for humanitarian reasons, similar to US parole. It is primarily through these discretionary admissions that nations like Germany accepted over 13,000, as did the United Kingdom; Belgium received 6,500; Italy received over 8,000; France and Australia each received more than 5,000; and approximately 10,000 went to Canada. This was in 2021 alone; many more followed. For example, Canada received 40,000 Afghans by October 2024.

The United States accepted more Afghan evacuees than any of its allies, just as it had the most servicemembers in Afghanistan. Indeed, the data shows a strong correlation between the number of forces nations deployed to Afghanistan and the number of Afghan refugees they accepted. This correlation exists because, as then Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, “we owe a debt of obligation” to those Afghans who served with them.

Policy Justifications for Evacuation and Resettlement

In 2021 US officials similarly argued the United States held an obligation to ensure the safety of Afghans who had demonstrated faithful service to the United States. These arguments did not merely surface in the face of a humiliating retreat but frequently appeared long before full withdrawal was certain. For example, in 2014, then US Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard stood in Congress and advocated for a bipartisan effort to expand the SIV program. After emphasizing the importance of teamwork she stated we cannot succeed without acting together with Afghan partners as “members of a team.” She went on to argue that bringing these Afghans to the United States was required to “honor our commitment to our team members.” The sentiment was felt across the globe among US allies and partners, as demonstrated by the synchronized and rapid response in accepting Afghan evacuees for resettlement.

When the dust settled from the chaos of late 2021, many allies conducted formal reviews of evacuation and resettlement efforts. Among many others, the Australian Senate initiated an independent review of its resettlement of more than 5,000 Afghan nationals. The review, completed in March 2023, included a series of lessons learned, and also provided a list of policy justifications for Australia’s actions. Those retrospective justifications are worth reviewing today.

According to the independent review, Australia’s efforts to evacuate and resettle Afghans were justified for four primary reasons.

First, to fulfill a moral obligation. This first, and primary justification is more fully explained below. The Australian review concluded that the moral obligation was felt keenly and almost unanimously by governments that provided forces in Afghanistan. But it was not unlimited. The Australian review notes the obligation must be balanced with competing policy concerns. Security and impartial humanitarian concerns are among those competing policy objectives. These concerns do not displace the moral obligation owed to those who faithfully served and are now at risk of harm because of it. But they do temper the obligation in a way that justifies reasonable limitations and prioritizations.

Second, to create an incentive for employment or partnership with Australia. Here the review makes the obvious point that loyalty is crucial to maintain alliances and attract new partners. The new US National Security Strategy is still committed to cultivating and attracting new alliances. Those efforts are assisted by strategic efforts to protect partners if they become vulnerable through associations to the US and its allies.

Third, to facilitate the settlement of skilled employees in Australia. The review emphasized that Afghans who qualified for the program were generally fluent in English and “job ready” on arrival. In this regard, Afghan evacuees were unlike many others admitted through the traditional refugee admissions process and often made immediate contributions to Australian communities.

Fourth, to provide an important measure of closure for Australians who served in Afghanistan. According to the report, Australian Defence Force personnel felt a “deep and personal” connection to Afghans partners. To abandon these Afghans would aggravate feelings that their efforts had been futile, or worse, had placed their partners at greater risk. The evacuation and resettlement of Afghan partners was, therefore, a form of relief to the memory of servicemembers who served their country in Afghanistan.

Conclusion

Finally, the question of moral obligation deserves further consideration today. Holding a moral responsibility to Afghan partners was the primary, and often the only, policy justification offered by government officials to evacuate and resettle Afghans. There is general consensus that there was no binding obligation in international law to evacuate and resettle Afghan partners. This is true despite nuanced domestic court rulings in the Netherlands and Italy that ordered resettlement of Afghan plaintiffs after they served with those governments. New Zealand’s High Court ruled differently, and in a way that seems more generally accepted, holding that its Government should consider Afghan partners for resettlement under domestic processes, but is not required to admit them under international law.

Similarly, legal obligations do not arise from principles of jus post bellum, the emerging branch of international law that seeks to regulate post-conflict transitions to peace. In the absence of a robust legal framework, jus post bellum principles rely on responsible behavior. They do not create legal obligations to evacuate or resettle. Indeed, jus post bellum has, historically, often focused partially on reparations and accountability following armed conflict, in an embrace of the maxim fiat justitia ruat caelum (do justice even if the heavens fall), as applied by victors. Michael Walzer and others have instead argued for obligations under jus post bellum that focus on the preservation of life. The goal of jus post bellum, he argues, should be “to stop the heavens from falling.” He went on to argue, long before the fall of Kabul, that the minimum expectation of a foreign occupier is that when they leave, they “must make sure that the men and women who cooperated with the occupation in any capacity will be safe in its aftermath—and if any of them are not safe, they must be given the opportunity to leave with the occupying force and be taken to the occupying state.”

This is the lex ferenda obligation the United States holds for Afghans who gave faithful and loyal service to the US mission in Afghanistan. It is not an unlimited obligation. But the evidence suggests that responsible governments take reasonable steps to ensure their allies are not placed at greater risk of harm because of past assistance to that government.",https://i0.wp.com/opiniojuris.org/wp-content/uploads/poppy-field-afghanistan-flower.jpeg?fit=1024%2C683,N,,2025-12-16 22:57:42.005405

The court stressed that asylum law and the Hague Convention serve different purposes and that a grant of asylum does not automatically bar a return order under the child abduction treaty.
Even so, the court signaled that the Hague Convention’s return system remains intact unless specific and concrete risks to a child can be shown.","(CN) — A Russian father won asylum in Finland after fleeing the war and political repression back home, but Europe’s top human rights court said Tuesday that protection alone does not stop his two children from being sent back to Russia under international child abduction rules.

What tipped the balance was not agreement with one parent over the other, but how the decision was made.

The European Court of Human Rights said Finland’s courts approached the case with the care required in cross-border child abduction disputes, balancing the competing interests at stake under the Hague Convention rather than defaulting to an automatic return.

Finnish judges, the court said, examined claims that the children faced psychological harm, assessed whether their objections were mature enough to carry legal weight and weighed how a return to Russia would affect their ability to maintain contact with their father.

After weighing all of that, the Strasbourg-based court concluded Finland stayed within the narrow boundaries the Hague Convention sets for blocking a child’s return.

At the center of the dispute was a Russian father who brought his two young sons, then 9 and 11, from Russia to Finland in September 2022 without their mother’s consent.

Once in Finland, he applied for asylum for himself and the children, telling authorities that his opposition to Russia’s political leadership and the war in Ukraine put him at risk if he returned.

Finnish officials later agreed, granting him asylum and extending that protection to his sons.

But while the asylum case was moving forward, the children’s mother took a separate legal route. She asked Finland’s courts to step in under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a treaty meant to undo wrongful cross-border removals by sending children back to where they normally live.

That set up a direct legal clash: When a parent wins asylum, does that protection stop a court from ordering a child’s return under the Hague Convention?

Finland’s Supreme Court answered that question in the negative. On Tuesday, the judges said that approach was compatible with Europe’s human rights standards.

The Hague Convention, the court stressed, is designed to quickly undo unilateral removals by returning children to their home country, unless narrow exceptions apply — including where there is a “grave risk” of physical or psychological harm.

After reviewing the record, the judges said Finland’s courts considered the exceptions and gave detailed, defensible reasons for rejecting them.

The court underlined that the Finnish Supreme Court did not ignore the children’s fears or objections. Judges interviewed the older child directly, with child welfare officers present, and assessed whether his views were mature and independent. They also considered evidence about schooling in Russia, including claims that the children had previously attended classes with military-style elements.

Ultimately, however, the Supreme Court found no sufficient proof that returning the children would expose them to serious harm, an assessment the judges saw no reason to disturb.

Judges stressed that while all three applicants had been granted asylum, the children’s protection flowed automatically from their father’s status — meaning the Finnish Supreme Court was not required to reopen its earlier Hague Convention analysis, having already assessed whether the boys faced a serious risk of harm.

That distinction proved decisive. The court stressed that asylum law and the Hague Convention serve different purposes and that a grant of asylum does not automatically bar a return order under the child abduction treaty.

The judges acknowledged that returning the children to Russia would make it harder for them to maintain contact with their father, who cannot safely travel back. But they said that difficulty alone cannot outweigh the convention’s core logic, which ties a child’s best interests to the “restoration of the status quo” and seeks to prevent a parent from gaining an advantage through a unilateral move.

Taken as a whole, the court concluded that Finland’s judges had done enough, finding that “the reasons given by the Supreme Court to justify the interference with the applicants’ right to respect for their family life were relevant and sufficient.”

That approach, legal scholars say, closely tracks the human rights court’s established case law. Paul Beaumont FRSE, professor of private international law at the University of Stirling, said the judges followed a well-settled playbook.

In his view, the chamber “faithfully followed” the court’s landmark X v. Latvia ruling, which requires Hague Convention exceptions to be interpreted narrowly, and was therefore entitled to uphold Finland’s return order even though the children had been granted asylum through their father.

As Beaumont put it, the Supreme Court’s reasoning was “not automatic and stereotyped” but sufficiently detailed to justify the return as “necessary in a democratic society,” including in a case where an older child objected.

Others see the judgment as signaling a narrower path for asylum-based challenges to return orders.

Katarina Trimmings, a professor of law at the University of Aberdeen, said the ruling points to a more cautious stance by the court when children receive asylum automatically through a parent, rather than on the basis of their own individual claims.

In her words, the judgment reflects “a more restrictive approach than some had anticipated,” with the court accepting that the children’s derivative asylum status did not, by itself, require Finnish judges to reopen their earlier risk assessment under the Hague Convention.

She said the decision signals that the human rights court is prepared to give national courts wide discretion when weighing child abduction rules against refugee protection, even where asylum has already been granted.

That procedural emphasis has drawn scrutiny from other legal scholars. Sanna Mustasaari, an associate professor at the University of Eastern Finland, said the judgment closely tracks the court’s recent emphasis on subsidiarity, meaning Strasbourg will step back so long as national courts can show they examined the right questions and followed proper procedure.

But she cautioned that the ruling gave too little weight to the children’s asylum status, largely because it was granted automatically. In her words, “the court could have and should have deliberated more on the issue of asylum status of the children.”

In her view, that gap matters, since asylum law and child abduction law rest on different legal foundations and serve distinct protective purposes.

Similar concerns surfaced inside the court itself. In a joint concurring opinion, Judge Saadet Yüksel and Judge Hugh Mercer agreed with the outcome but flagged what they saw as a blind spot in how asylum was handled.

They took issue with the way Finland’s Supreme Court leaned on the fact that the children’s asylum status was granted automatically, without pausing to reconsider what that status might signal about the risks the children could face if sent back. As they saw it, asylum is not a technical label but a recognition that return itself carries danger, something that should not be brushed aside simply because protection flows from a parent.

As the judges put it, “it is inherent in the notion of asylum that there is a grave risk for those granted asylum if they are returned to their country of origin.”

Yüksel and Mercer did not say the return order should necessarily have been blocked in this case. But they warned that future courts should tread carefully. Treating asylum as a procedural detail rather than a warning sign, they cautioned, risks weakening protection against forced return in cases involving refugees, especially when children are involved.

The applicants’ lawyer echoed that concern, warning that the judgment places heavy weight on procedure at the expense of substantive refugee protection.

Harri Nevala, the lawyer representing the applicants, said the ruling reflects “a shift toward an emphatically procedural model of human rights supervision,” one that risks treating asylum as marginal in child abduction cases and raising the evidentiary bar for families who have already been granted international protection.

For now, the children will remain in Finland under interim measures, and the return order cannot be enforced unless the ruling becomes final or the court lifts its protective order.

Beyond the immediate outcome, the case underscores a growing strain across Europe, as judges are increasingly asked to untangle family disputes shaped by war, political repression and cross-border flight. Even so, the court signaled that the Hague Convention’s return system remains intact unless specific and concrete risks to a child can be shown.

Russia today is marked by a sharply constricted political and social space. Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin has expanded the use of “foreign agent” and “extremism” laws, tightened controls on independent media and civil society groups, and criminalized public criticism of the war.

Many opposition figures, journalists and rights organizations have been forced into exile or shut down, while courts have played a central role in enforcing the state’s crackdown. That broader environment forms the backdrop to the case, even if the human rights court’s legal analysis was confined to the narrow framework of the Hague Convention.

The judgment will become final in three months unless one of the parties asks for a review by the court’s Grand Chamber.

Finland’s Foreign Ministry said it was reviewing the judgment and declined to comment further at this stage.

In Florida, Trump actually increased his vote share from his previous campaigns.
At one point, Trump’s lawsuit cites former prime minister Liz Truss in support of its allegation that the BBC is “institutionally biased against President Trump”.
Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said it was “right that the BBC stand firm” against Trump’s claims of defamation and that he hoped “they will continue to do so”.
“[The BBC] will plead substantial truth, no damage to [Trump’s] reputation – but it will also, at that time, file the motions to dismiss [the lawsuit],” he predicted.","The BBC is preparing to argue Donald Trump’s $10bn court case against it should be dismissed, arguing it has no case to answer over the US president’s claims he was defamed by an episode of Panorama.

The development comes after Trump filed a 33-page complaint to a Florida court on Monday, accusing the broadcaster of “a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory and malicious depiction” of the president in the documentary.

On Tuesday, the BBC said it would defend itself over the suit. It is understood that the corporation is likely to argue that it did not have the rights to air the documentary in the US, and that the case should therefore be dismissed.

The move is an attempt to see the lawsuit off before litigation costs mount. It will be greeted with relief by supporters of the BBC who have argued that its editorial independence would be called into question if it sought to settle.

The Panorama programme, Trump: A Second Chance?, was broadcast before the 2024 US presidential election. It spliced together two parts of the January 6 speech he gave before the attack on the US Capitol that day.

Trump’s complaint argues both that the programme defamed him and that it violated the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. It says the broadcast caused Trump “massive economic damage to his brand value and significant damage and injury to his future financial prospects”.

The BBC will note that audiences in the US were unable to access the show via iPlayer, the BBC’s streaming platform.

The corporation is also arguing that Trump could not have suffered serious reputational harm from the programme because he won the presidential election. In Florida, Trump actually increased his vote share from his previous campaigns.

The lawsuit alleges that Florida residents may have been able to watch the programme using a virtual private network (VPN) or via the international streaming service, BritBox. The BBC has not responded directly to those claims.

The BBC board and lawyers are still working closely on the issue. The BBC’s legal department is guiding the discussions, but the board, together with the BBC chair, Samir Shah, are understood to be closely involved.

The suit also claims the documentary was distributed in the US through a company called Blue Ant Media Corporation. The company is not a defendant in the case.

However, a spokesperson for Blue Ant Media said none of its buyers had aired the Panorama episode in the US, while the version it was distributing did not include the infamous edit, which had been cut out to make the programme shorter.

The timing could scarcely be worse for the BBC, as it searches for a new director general. It comes after the resignation of current director general Tim Davie and head of BBC News, Deborah Turness, following the fallout from the Panorama edit.

It also comes with the government officially launching the process of renewing the BBC’s charter, which will see it fundamentally re-examine whether the corporation should be part-funded by advertising or subscriptions.

The spliced clips in the edition of Panorama suggested that Trump told the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.”

The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart.

Shah has already personally apologised to Trump and the BBC has said it gave “the mistaken impression” that the president had “made a direct call for violent action”. However, its lawyers have argued it did not defame him.

While there were no complaints about the documentary at the time it was broadcast, the edit came to light in a memo by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser to the BBC. His memo was sent to the BBC board earlier this year and subsequently leaked to the Daily Telegraph.

At one point, Trump’s lawsuit cites former prime minister Liz Truss in support of its allegation that the BBC is “institutionally biased against President Trump”.

“No less an authority than the United Kingdom’s former prime minister, Liz Truss, discussed this bias, the need to hold the BBC accountable, and the BBC’s pattern of actual malice,” it states.

Keir Starmer has come under pressure to back up the BBC. Both the shadow culture secretary, Nigel Huddleston, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, urged the prime minister to use his relationship with Trump to persuade him not to pursue the legal action.

Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said it was “right that the BBC stand firm” against Trump’s claims of defamation and that he hoped “they will continue to do so”.

Chris Ruddy, a Trump ally who founded the Newsmax platform, said it would prove cheaper for the BBC to settle the case.

However, figures close to the BBC have urged it to fight the legal action. Former BBC Radio controller Mark Damazer said it would be “extremely damaging” to the BBC’s reputation to offer a settlement.

Mark Stephens, an international media lawyer at the firm Howard Kennedy, said he believed the claim was “meritless”, but that Trump was seeking political, rather than financial, gain.

“[The BBC] will plead substantial truth, no damage to [Trump’s] reputation – but it will also, at that time, file the motions to dismiss [the lawsuit],” he predicted. “There are lots of legal defects in the complaint.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5de5a2274a01defdc6e2f027aea5477fcc8cba3/3639_1105_4892_3913/master/4892.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=132c93ad46ca6fbaa3b2eabf9df3d0b9",N,,2025-12-16 16:57:56.311884

Detaining migrants who leave voluntarily may be aimed to impose long-term reentry penalties, since formal removal can bar people from returning for years or permanently.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem defended the administration’s hardline immigration strategy at last Thursday’s House Homeland Security Committee hearing, saying rising voluntary departures show the approach is working.

However, the “Operation Irish Goodbye” may be serving a different purpose: inflating deportation statistics as the administration pushes to show progress toward Trump’s goal of record-high removals — even though its projected 600,000 deportations remain below Biden’s 685,000 in 2024.

Noem seems to have support from Texan Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), whose 23 district has the longest border with Mexico. At the hearing he said: “Please go back to your agencies and thank the men and women helping to keep this country safe.”

DHS has also launched a new “Worst of the Worst” searchable database claiming that 70% of ICE arrests involve criminal offenders, despite data showing most detained individuals have no criminal record. New data from UC Berkeley’s Deportation Data Project shows that ICE arrested nearly 75,000 people with no criminal record under Trump, contradicting the administration’s narrative about enforcement priorities.

Following a five-day trial in November, jurors awarded $112 million in damages to more than 670 immigrants. They found that Suffolk, the easternmost county in New York State, and its sheriff's office unlawfully detained those immigrants between 2014-2018 based solely on detainers issued by ICE without showing probable cause.

The immigrants in question were them in jail after they were eligible for release so they could be transferred to federal immigration authorities. Jurors ruled the practice violated constitutional protections against unlawful detention and due process, resulting in the $112 million award. Civil rights advocates said the verdict carries major implications for how local governments may handle immigration detentions and further cooperate with federal authorities on immigration-based policies.

“There are too many variables involved to determine the effect that this verdict may have on the financial condition of the county at this time,” Mark Johnson, a spokesperson for the New York State Comptroller’s Office, told Military.com.

The county’s appeal was disclosed in filings to bond investors following the verdict.

Military.com reached out for comment to Suffolk County officials and the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office, as well as ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.

The verdict was eight years in the making. In 2017, the law firm Winston & Strawn and co-counsel LatinoJustice PRLDEF filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York asserting that Suffolk County unlawfully refused, based solely on detainer requests issued by ICE, to release their clients from custody after the resolution of their criminal cases.

Verdict 'Sends Message'

“In our system of justice, it is well known that jurors have historically used their verdict to send a message,” Efrén Olivares, vice president of litigation and legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center, told Military.com. “A $112 million damages verdict against Suffolk County sends that message.”

Olivares said the case underscores a legal boundary that many local governments have crossed, that civil detainers are not judicially authorized criminal warrants and can lead to unjust and unlawful detentions.

Other state and local entities that unlawfully detain immigrants may pay a similar price for their unlawful complicity with the federal government, Olivares added.

Advocates say the ruling lands at a moment when cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agencies remains under intense national scrutiny.

Immigration detention has increasingly intersected with the military community, including cases involving noncitizen service members and their families who have been caught in prolonged or disputed custody situations. It has prompted broader scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates concerned about due process and the depths of local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Civil Detainers Triggered the Suit

Federal courts have consistently ruled that detainers, such as those by ICE, are voluntary and do not carry the authority of a judge-signed warrant.

A federal judge previously found Suffolk County liable, leaving jurors to determine damages. Jurors unanimously found that the county had violated clients’ rights and ordered them to pay $75 million for its Fourth Amendment and New York Constitution violations and another $37 million for procedural due process violations, according to a press release from Winston & Strawn.

The combined $112 million award is nearly 100 times larger than the firm’s next highest pro bono award.

Civil rights advocates familiar with the case say the compensation is expected to be distributed to individual plaintiffs based on the duration and circumstances of their detention, rather than paid to the county or federal government.

Regional Financial Impact Unknown

Suffolk County officials face questions about how the verdict could affect budgets and taxpayers.

Mark Johnson said Suffolk County disclosed to bond investors that it intends to appeal the judgment, adding that the county is best positioned to explain how it plans to manage the potential liability.

Audited financial statements show Suffolk County reported $2.65 billion in general fund revenues for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2024. The county’s debt limit stands at $28.5 billion, with 3.59% of that limit exhausted. The comptroller’s Fiscal Stress Monitoring System last designated the county at a moderate level of fiscal stress for the fiscal year ending Dec. 31, 2020.

There is no definitive timeline for the appeal process to reach conclusion.

By the end of November, the intensive federal presence in North Carolina appeared to have calmed down, according to Garcia-Sampson, Lansdale, and numerous media reports.
“I think Customs and Border Patrol really underestimated North Carolina,” Lansdale said.
“Not to mention, Border Patrol leaving [North Carolina] means they’re going somewhere else,” said Weatherspoon, whose congregation has been involved with immigration as a justice issue for many years.","In mid-November, when the federal government’s aggressive tactics against immigrants shifted to North Carolina, Unitarian Universalists and their longtime social justice partners were ready to respond.

As Border Patrol agents arrested more than 270 people in Charlotte in what the Department of Homeland Security dubbed “Operation Charlotte’s Web,” they encountered strong resistance, including trained patrols who alerted the community of federal presence, recorded detentions, and escorted vulnerable populations to school, work, and church. When agents began detaining immigrants in Raleigh and Durham, they met similar pushback.

Over ten days, November 15 to 24, more than 5,000 people were trained in resistance tactics by Siembra NC, which began during the first Trump administration to support the Latine community against aggressive anti-immigrant tactics, said Rev. Sadie Lansdale, minister at UU Church of Greensboro (UUCG). Her congregation has worked closely with Siembra NC for years.

Throughout November, UU congregations across the state hosted numerous trainings on organizing neighborhood patrols—known as ICE Watch—and “Know Your Rights” trainings for workplaces, said Rev. Lisa Garcia-Sampson, executive director of UU Justice Ministry of North Carolina. And UUJNC received a $20,000 emergency grant from the UU Service Committee, which UUJNC has distributed to its immigrant justice partners, she said.

Nearly 1,000 people attended two virtual trainings in November in which Protect Rogers Park, a community defense network in Chicago formed to protect immigrant communities from ICE, shared successful strategies, Lansdale said.

And on November 20, the North Carolina Council of Churches, which includes nineteen denominations across the state, held a press conference where clergy, including Rev. Amanda Weatherspoon, minister at UU Community of Charlotte, “talked about how our faith speaks to values of resisting Border Patrol and ICE,” Weatherspoon said.

By the end of November, the intensive federal presence in North Carolina appeared to have calmed down, according to Garcia-Sampson, Lansdale, and numerous media reports.

“I think Customs and Border Patrol really underestimated North Carolina,” Lansdale said. “They didn’t know what was coming for them.” Many who participated in the resistance “are just normal people who are pissed off” by how immigrants are being treated, she said.

“People are on patrol constantly,” Garcia-Sampson said. “We have our whistles and our vests. It’s a massive presence.”

And more than 2,500 people participated in organized efforts to escort vulnerable people to work and school in multiple counties across the state, Lansdale said.

Upcoming efforts will include pressuring local and state officials to push back against “this federal overreach,” which is not only harmful to immigrants but everyone in the state, including the negative impact on the economy from people afraid to work, shop, and go to school, said Lansdale.

‘Thousands of People Have Powerfully Met the Moment’

In a November 19 news release, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called Operation Charlotte’s Web “a major win for the residents of Charlotte,” stating it made arrests of “numerous criminal illegal aliens with extensive immigration and criminal histories.”

However, less than one-third of those arrested in the operation were classified as criminals, according to CBS News, which analyzed DHS data.

And nationally, 65 percent of people booked into detention by ICE since October 2024 have no criminal convictions at all, and more than 93 percent were never convicted of violent offenses, according to an analysis of non-public ICE data obtained by the non-partisan Cato Institute.

Since no one knows where federal agents will appear next in North Carolina, the goal is to ensure that every city is ready to respond, Garcia-Sampson said.

“Not to mention, Border Patrol leaving [North Carolina] means they’re going somewhere else,” said Weatherspoon, whose congregation has been involved with immigration as a justice issue for many years.

“We are thick in an urgent crisis, and we’re in a marathon at the same time,” said Garcia-Sampson, who noted that UUJNC is part of Blueprint NC, a progressive ecosystem of over 85 partner organizations as well as allies working on a variety of social justice issues.

“The real story of our movement isn’t that thousands of people have powerfully met the moment but that this is a sustained movement rooted in a lot of trust and a lot of collaboration,” Garcia-Sampson said, “and that these types of trainings and preparation and readiness have been happening for a very long time here.

Weekend arrest

The backstory:

On Saturday, a large group confronted ICE agents as they attempted to arrest two construction workers at a build on Avienda Parkway.

One man was taken away by ambulance, but the other stayed on a roof until ICE agents left, in part thanks to help from the crowd of activists, some of whom provided warm drinks, food and blankets.

Chanhassen leaders respond

What we know:

Before the council broke ranks for the evening, council member Mark Von Oven spoke about the ""process, transparency and constitutional protections"" needed during a federal immigration raid at the construction site on Saturday.

Von Oven spoke on the need for increased communication between city and federal agents.

""When federal agents arrive in a community without coordination with local law enforcement… They create a situation where constitutional rights could be violated,"" Von Oven said.

""How is it that we’ve become so blinded by our own political bias that we have forced ourselves into a standoff like this?"" he rhetorically asked.

Von Oven was elected to the City Council in 2022, and has lived in Chanhassen since 2016, according to his city website biography.

He later noted that he believes in ""legal immigration"" and that ""illegal immigration is illegal"" and that ""those who enter illegally, or overstay their visas should face consequences.""

According to the ACLU report, ICE officers reportedly handcuffed non-Mexican detainees at Camp East Montana, loaded them onto vans and transported them over an hour away to the U.S.-Mexico border near Santa Teresa, New Mexico.
Detainees report insufficient food portions, spoiled or inedible meals, lack of adequate hygiene supplies such as soap and clean clothes, and unsanitary sleeping and living spaces.
Continued allegations of abuse at Camp East Montana Camp East Montana opened in August in what was an active construction site and now holds more than 2,700 men and women – part of a militarized expansion of immigration detention under the Trump administration.
Escobar said people held at Camp East Montana continue to face unsafe and unhealthy conditions, including foul-tasting drinking water, poor-quality food and inconsistent laundry services that force some detainees to wash clothes in showers.","Immigrants detained at Camp East Montana at Fort Bliss say they have been coerced by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to cross the border into the Mexican desert – even if they have no connection to Mexico – or be sent to jail in third countries, human rights groups allege in a letter to the federal border protection agency.

The facility has become a “human and civil rights catastrophe,” the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations said in the letter sent Monday to ICE and Fort Bliss officials. The organizations are calling for the camp to be shut down, alleging detained immigrants are subject to beatings and sexual abuse by officers, as well as medical neglect, hunger and insufficient food, and denial of access to attorneys.

A number of detainees suffered serious injuries due to these physical abuses, the report alleges, and in one reported case a detained teenager said he lost consciousness and required hospitalization after being slammed to the ground.

“Officers have engaged in a widespread and unreasonable pattern and practice of excessive force, including the use of abusive sexual contact by officers when utilizing force,” the organizations said in a news release.

Neither the U.S. Department of Homeland Security nor Fort Bliss immediately responded to El Paso Matters’ request for comment. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post that “no detainees are being beaten or abused” and that all people being deported to third countries are given due process protections.

The 19-page letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, ACLU said in the news release. They’re calling for a thorough investigation into all the alleged abuses.

Other organizations that signed the letter include the ACLU of New Mexico, the ACLU of Texas, Estrella del Paso, Human Rights Watch, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and the Texas Civil Rights Project.

“We can’t stay silent about what is happening at Camp East Montana. After speaking with dozens of detained immigrants, the reports are clear: abuse, neglect, and unsafe living conditions are widespread,” Estrella del Paso, a nonprofit organization of the Catholic Diocese of El Paso, posted on Instagram, demanding “immediate action and accountability.”

Third-country removals

The groups are calling for President Donald Trump’s administration to halt all third-country removals from Fort Bliss, such as deportations to Mexico of non-Mexican immigrants, until procedural safeguards are in place.

According to the ACLU report, ICE officers reportedly handcuffed non-Mexican detainees at Camp East Montana, loaded them onto vans and transported them over an hour away to the U.S.-Mexico border near Santa Teresa, New Mexico. Masked officers then allegedly instructed detainees to “jump” into Mexico to be deported.

The alleged efforts to force people into Mexico would not comply with U.S. and international laws on third-country deportations, which require the consent of the third country and promises not to subject those being returned to persecution or abuse.

In one sworn declaration, a Cuban immigrant held at the Fort Bliss facility said officers handcuffed him and about 20 others, placed them on a bus and drove them to the border. There, they were told to get off the bus and cross into Mexico.

“If we don’t want to go to Mexico, then we would either be sent to a jail cell in El Salvador or Africa,” Isaac, a pseudonym used to protect his identity, said in his declaration. He told lawyers that guards hit him, slammed him against the wall about 10 times and grabbed and crushed his testicles.

Detainees who refused to cross into Mexico say they were threatened with criminal charges, long-term imprisonment or violence, the report states, citing similar claims by other Cuban immigrants.

It’s not clear from the detainees’ statements provided by the ACLU whether any migrants crossed into Mexico under the conditions described. Some of the collected affidavits state those who signed what “appeared” to be voluntary deportation papers were separated from those who refused to sign and not seen from again.

Third-country deportation refers to the U.S. sending someone to a country that is neither their home country nor a country of their citizenship.

Historically rare and based on individual cases, the practice expanded sharply under the second Trump administration as a tool to remove or intimidate immigrants who could not legally be returned to their home countries due to risks of persecution, according to the American Immigration Council.

These actions, including transfers to places where people faced imprisonment or danger, raise serious concerns about compliance with U.S. laws prohibiting deportation to countries where individuals may be persecuted or tortured, the nonprofit organization that advocates for immigration justice said.

The U.S. Supreme Court in June temporarily upheld the Trump administration’s third-country deportation policies, blocking a lower court’s order that required 15 days notice. The Supreme Court’s ruling is pending the outcome of an appeal to the lower court, expected to be heard in federal court in Massachusetts this month, the Washington Post reported. In July, ICE instructed agency personnel they could remove people to third countries with six-hours notice.

The ACLU alleges detention officers threatening immigrants to cross into Mexico runs counter to the protocols governing third-country deportations – including ICE’s own guidance following the court rulings.

Medical neglect, other allegations

Other allegations in the ACLU report include:

Medical neglect: Detainees report delayed or denied medical, dental and mental-health care, including failure to administer prescription medication on time or at all, despite serious chronic conditions.

Food and hygiene: Conditions are described as substandard and unsanitary. Detainees report insufficient food portions, spoiled or inedible meals, lack of adequate hygiene supplies such as soap and clean clothes, and unsanitary sleeping and living spaces.

Restricted access to legal counsel: Access to attorneys and legal resources are severely restricted or effectively denied: the facility reportedly lacks a functioning law library, detainees have limited or non-private phone access, and legal visits are often blocked or delayed.

Limited access to recreation: Detainees report extremely limited access to outdoor recreation or fresh air; many say they have gone weeks or months without seeing the sky or being allowed outside, violating standards for detainee well-being.

The detained teenager, who uses Samuel as a pseudonym for his safety, told attorneys he was beaten by officers, sustained injuries across his body and broke his front tooth after being slammed to the ground.

Samuel attested one officer ”grabbed my testicles and firmly crushed them,” while another “forced his fingers deep into my ears.” He said he felt dizzy and fought to remain conscious while an officer laughed at him for having a chipped tooth and said Samuel was “like a little girl,” the report states. Samuel lost consciousness and was transported to a hospital by ambulance.

Continued allegations of abuse at Camp East Montana

Camp East Montana opened in August in what was an active construction site and now holds more than 2,700 men and women – part of a militarized expansion of immigration detention under the Trump administration. The Washington Post in September reported the facility violated more than 60 federal detention standards within its first 50 days, citing a leaked internal ICE inspection report.

DHS called the report “false and misleading,” with McLaughlin in a statement saying any claims of inhumane conditions at ICE detention centers “categorically false.” The statement said all detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment and are provided opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family members.

The $1.2 billion facility – expected to grow to about 5,000 detainees to become the country’s largest federal detention center for civil detainees – is funded by the Department of Defense under the reconciliation bill. The Big Beautiful Bill provided $45 billion in supplemental funding to double migrant detention capacity nationwide to 100,000 beds.

In a November letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Tom Lyons, Democratic U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar called the conditions at Camp East Montana “dangerous and inhumane.”

“They have been since the facility opened at the beginning of August (when it was still an active construction site), and only seem to be deteriorating,” the El Paso congresswoman wrote. “It is increasingly clear that it is not a safe nor professionally managed facility.”

She said staff are unable to maintain accurate population counts, and pressed for answers about staffing, vendor changes and protocols.

Escobar said people held at Camp East Montana continue to face unsafe and unhealthy conditions, including foul-tasting drinking water, poor-quality food and inconsistent laundry services that force some detainees to wash clothes in showers. She also cited unsanitary dorms and flooding and sewage backups.

The court can order people to be held indefinitely, as long as the government thinks it can find a country that will take them. The court can send people to countries they haven’t seen since they were in preschool. It can send them to countries they’ve never set foot in before, even if those countries are in the middle of a civil war. These results are in addition to immigration court’s usual, everyday practice of breaking apart families by sending people away from their spouses, children, and communities.

With consequences this serious, you would think that process in immigration court would be substantial, filled with all the procedural safeguards the American legal system can offer. You would be wrong. Instead, the people whom ICE is snatching off the street are thrust into immigration court, a sham in which three-year-olds represent themselves, not all the hearings are fully translated, and the judges and prosecutors both have the same boss: Attorney General Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and, ultimately, President Donald Trump.

When most people think of “courts,” they usually think of courts that fall within the judicial branch of the federal government. Immigration courts, however, are part of the executive branch; they are housed in the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a division of the Department of Justice. The judges are Department of Justice employees, and prosecutors represent the Department of Homeland Security. The setup is the same at the first-tier appellate level, the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is also housed within the Department of Justice.

From there, noncitizens can appeal their cases to the federal courts of appeals, where the judge is an Article III judge. But the prosecutor they face is still employed by the Department of Justice—the employer of the judges in the immigration courts below.

In other words, a noncitizen in immigration court faces opposition from both the prosecutor and the judge, who both follow orders from the president. Perhaps the neatest illustration of this problem came in November, when the Department of Homeland Security account posted on Instagram an advertisement seeking to hire “deportation judges” for the Department of Justice.

Immigration court’s bizarre location within the constitutional framework is only one of many problems with this body. Even though the court makes decisions about liberty, counsel is not provided at government expense, as it is in the criminal system. Every year, tens of thousands of children are put through immigration court, and roughly half of them do not have lawyers.

Immigration court doesn’t have detailed rules of procedure, either. The Code of Federal Regulations establishes extremely basic rules of immigration procedure, but all they really do is give EOIR the power to create its own procedures. EOIR has, in turn, put together a “practice manual,” which establishes basic things like filing deadlines. But the first chapter of the manual explicitly empowers immigration judges to decide that the rules are not binding in a given case before them. EOIR can also revoke or revise the manual at any time, with no notice to litigants.

What this means in practice is that prosecutors can violate most or all of the rules and suffer no consequences whatsoever. Evidence—some ancient deportation order, for example—disclosed by the government on the day of trial? That’s fine in immigration court, though it would be a major constitutional violation in a criminal trial. When this happens, immigration judges won’t even give the noncitizen a new court date so they can review the new material.

There are also no fixed rules of evidence in immigration court, so the immigration judge has tremendous latitude in allowing evidence that would never be admissible in a criminal or civil court. Take the threshold issue of whether or not a person is a noncitizen. The burden of proof is on the government. However, the most common method of proof is a police report, otherwise known as an I-213. If the report states that someone said the respondent is a noncitizen, the government has met its burden, even without the testimony of the arresting agent.

This testimony would allow the noncitizen to challenge an individual agent’s credibility in a particular matter. In criminal trials, this right is protected by the Confrontation Clause in the Sixth Amendment. But the Department of Justice has decided that in immigration court, I-213s are inherently trustworthy. Sometimes the name of the agent is even redacted, so even if immigrants had the right to cross-examine, calling the agent to testify would be impossible.

If a case makes its way through the Department of Justice and arrives at a federal appeals court, you might think that a noncitizen could get some justice. But you would again be wrong. In 1996, President Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, a statute that stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear cases that deal with many immigration issues. In 2022, the Supreme Court made matters worse by holding in Garland v. Gonzalez that federal appeals courts do not have the power to broadly enjoin unlawful immigration policies perpetrated by the government. In practice, this means that every person who is a victim of the government’s abuse must sue to protect their own individual rights.

Nowhere is this rule more impactful than in cases of immigration detention. Although the law says that immigration detention is not punishment, in practice, it is not much different from criminal confinement. Immigrants are often housed in the same facilities as people convicted of crimes. They wear jumpsuits. They are often shackled. Calling loved ones is often expensive. And under IIRAIRA, many immigrants in detention are not eligible for release, or even for hearings in order to determine whether they can be released. This, too, is the fault of IIRAIRA, under which “arriving aliens” are not entitled to bond. As a result, the government can simply decide that someone is an “arriving alien” and keep them locked up.

Over the past several months, the Trump administration has gleefully abused this power, claiming that any person who crossed the border without authorization at any time, even years ago, is an “arriving alien” under IIRAIRA, with all the attendant limits on their legal rights. Hundreds of people have challenged this policy in federal court, and judges have been ordering people released. But it can take months for these lawsuits to succeed, and until there is a clear federal decision outlawing this policy, noncitizens will continue to be locked up.

The black robes and raised platforms might make you think immigration courts represent some form of justice, but it’s just legal theater. These executive branch offices are fast tracks to detention and deportation, leaving behind wrecked lives and splintered families.",http://ballsandstrikes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2240760995-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 12:58:10.919976

The best question that someone put to us at last week’s webinar on earned settlement was along the lines of how will the Home Office communicate to people that all of a sudden the rules have been changed on them and they are now on a much longer path to settlement? As I did casework over the weekend, and started to properly get to terms with the already significant changes that have been enacted through the expansion of Part Suitability to Appendix FM and in particular the implications for people with any period of overstaying in their past (and a big thank you to Alex Piletska for her excellent write up on those changes), I realised that the answer is almost certainly that the Home Office will do nothing to tell people directly.

For the people who can afford lawyers, we get the trauma of having to explain to people over and over again that the government has upended their lives. For those who can’t access any advice – what happens? Presumably many will learn their fate only when they come to do the application form, assuming that the changes are even made clear at that point.

Late knowledge of sudden ineligibility for settlement will itself have consequences – an unplanned for immigration health surcharge is not an expense that can easily be borne by many people. Extreme levels of cruelty aside, I really doubt that anyone at the Home Office fully realises how much chaos this is going to throw the system into.

In other news, the first legal challenge has been launched in relation to the government’s plans to accommodate hundreds of people seeking asylum in a military camp in east Sussex. As has been the case with other challenges, this one is based on planning law.

On Free Movement, it’s a double shout out to Alex in this week’s newsletter, as she has written this excellent and detailed briefing on the practical implications of the earned settlement proposals. I referred to it a few times in last week’s webinar (which, if you missed out, will be available free for members here by the end of the week). I was not very impressed with the surprise statement of changes turning up on the day I had set aside to prepare for the talk, but it was thankfully a short one.

Also on the blog, I covered the quarterly tribunal statistics where things continue to veer completely out of control, the latest podcast is out, and Chris Benn wrote up this Court of Appeal decision looking at derivative rights and self-employment.

In Chicago this fall, ICE agents were nearly overrun by angry protesters.","Not even in Gracie Mansion yet, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is once again courting controversy with the release of a recent video on federal immigration enforcement operations.

The top-line theme of the video (“know your rights”) sounds reasonable enough. What’s wrong with knowing your rights?

But in context, the video’s message is far more sinister: an endorsement of resistance to the enforcement of duly enacted federal immigration law, as well as tacit encouragement of chaotic, disruptive, and potentially violent clashes between anti-Trump activists and immigration-enforcement authorities.

For starters, Mamdani leads with the promise “to protect the rights” of those whom immigration authorities aimed to detain, as if immigration enforcement constitutes some kind of rights violation. That framing is immediately followed by a call to “stand up to [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] ICE.” That may not constitute an explicit call for obstruction, but it comes off as a wink and a nod, once you understand that the video appeared after ICE agents were physically obstructed by a crowd in downtown New York days earlier—an incident Mamdani referenced as the reason for his video.

The city has already gotten a glimpse of what this activist-driven chaos could look like. Late last month, police arrested at least 18 agitators in downtown Manhattan for disorderly conduct and obstructing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles in an attempt to disrupt an enforcement operation.

Unsurprisingly, given the Big Apple’s political climate, the anti-ICE rabblerousers were lauded rather than condemned. New York published a glowing profile of them and the nonprofit groups that trained and deployed them. New York attorney general Letitia James offered support for those arrested in a statement on X. Instead of reprimanding the lawbreakers thwarting federal agents, City Comptroller Brad Lander condemned the NYPD’s restoration of order, calling it a violation of New York’s sanctuary city policy.

Apparently, it’s not enough to refuse cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. To be truly moral, according to some progressive leaders, the city must also turn a blind eye toward those actively hindering enforcement efforts. This encourages activists to escalate their tactics—a recipe for disaster.

Other cities have shown us just how out of control anti-ICE clashes can get. In Los Angeles last summer, immigration enforcement operations sparked riots. As I pointed out then, those riots occurred after local officials—namely, L.A. mayor Karen Bass and California governor Gavin Newsom—primed the pump with incendiary statements like those in Mamdani’s video.

In Chicago this fall, ICE agents were nearly overrun by angry protesters. Reports also circulated that a Chicago police executive, presumably at the direction of Mayor Brandon Johnson, ordered local police not to assist the federal agents who had called for help (a claim local officials disputed).

And everyone seems already to have forgotten the September sniper attack on a Dallas ICE field office that targeted ICE officers but killed two detainees and wounded a third.

Since President Trump took office, assaults against ICE agents have spiked by more than 1,150 percent, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which attributed the surge to anti-ICE rhetoric in “sanctuary” jurisdictions. One would expect the next leader of America’s largest city to want to avoid provoking more such violence.

But Mamdani’s video seems calibrated to unleash more violence, more clashes, and more disorder. That is what he invites by framing the deportation of illegal immigrants as violations of rights and the physical obstruction of federal law enforcement officers as constitutionally protected “protest.”

It’s worth remembering that Mamdani, who has previously referred to immigration enforcement actions as kidnappings and manifestations of cruelty, had to be physically restrained by police when border czar Tom Homan visited the state capital.

A word of warning to the New Yorkers inclined to accept Mamdani’s invitation: by all means, know your rights. But know the rights of others, too—especially those of the silent majority of nonactivists who don’t want their city to descend into even more chaos.",https://media4.manhattan-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/Zohran-Mamdani-federal-immigration-enforcement-ICE-video.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 13:56:52.099788

Among its more obvious faults—and there is no bigger one than the vicious clowns the president has appointed to run it—the administration’s toxic spitball approach to immigration is almost completely incoherent. This administration is deliberately oblivious to consequences anyway, be they intended or unintended. However, its policies on H-1B visas are doing real-world damage in many different places. From The Washington Post:

The overworked kidney doctors in this small town were supposed to get reinforcement this fall with the arrival of a new colleague from India. Patients already had appointments scheduled with the incoming nephrologist. Then the Trump administration demanded that companies pay a $100,000 visa fee to bring highly skilled workers from abroad, including doctors and medical professionals urgently needed in health care deserts. Nephrology Associates of the Carolinas could no longer afford to sponsor the Indian kidney specialist, and it has not found an American well suited for the job. After President Donald Trump signed the executive order restricting H-1B visas in September, soaring costs are roiling rural health care facilities that have long struggled to find staff. The fee increase for visa applicants, coupled with broader crackdowns on legal pathways for foreign-born workers, threatens a growing industry and jeopardizes patients who need timely care, according to labor experts and immigration lawyers.

It is easy to say, Okay, rural voters, stop voting for morons and mountebanks who couldn’t care less if you sicken and die. I’ve done it myself, many times. But kidney patients in Shelby are just as much in need of medical treatment as kidney patients in Wellesley or the Hamptons. And to have their health ruined by the administration’s frankly extortionist H-1B policy is a disgrace about which none of us should be blithe.

These legal workers fill crucial gaps in rural and underserved regions, according to medical associations and health care researchers. Iowa, North Dakota and West Virginia—states that overwhelmingly voted for Trump in the last three elections—lead the nation with the highest percentage of physicians who hold H-1B visas, according to a study published this year. Last year, the percentage of H-1B-sponsored doctors in rural counties was nearly twice the share in urban ones, according to research published in JAMA in October. Impoverished counties also had a significantly higher percentage of H-1B physicians, said lead author Michael Liu, a resident physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Liu himself works on a trainee visa from Canada and hopes to eventually remain in the United States on an H-1B visa.

With the subsidies under the Affordable Care Act expiring, most of these folks aren’t going to be able to afford to see a doctor anyway, so what’s the difference, right? That this county can’t—and won’t—be able to figure out what every other industrialized nation figured out years ago continues to amaze and astonish.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/draw-assistant-united-states-president-donald-trump-during-news-photo-1765829092.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.74991xh;center,top&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-16 11:56:54.962244

International human rights law governs the US government’s confrontations with suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.
Further, countries have an obligation under international human rights law to investigate and punish serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings.","The United States is carrying out a campaign of extrajudicial killings with deliberately lethal strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific oceans without any credible legal basis. The Trump administration claims the boats are carrying “narco-traffickers” who belong to groups it has designated as terrorist organizations under US law. But the US government has neither identified the people killed in any of the cases nor demonstrated that those killed in the strikes were doing anything that could justify the use of lethal force.

This document analyzes the legality of these strikes under international law and explains why international human rights law—rather than international humanitarian law (“the laws of war”)—governs that analysis. More specifically, it provides answers to the following questions :

How many individuals have been killed by the US military in this campaign?

Are these US military strikes lawful under international law?

Does the “war on drugs” create legal authority for the United States to use lethal force?

Are the boat strikes lawful if the Trump administration says they have only killed members of designated foreign terrorist organizations?

What rules apply if this is not an armed conflict?

Has the United States demonstrated an imminent threat justifying the killings?

Could these killings be considered war crimes?

Are US military personnel responsible for these extrajudicial killings?

Are other countries that cooperate with the US military complicit in these extrajudicial killings?

What obligations does the United States have toward the families of those killed and survivors of the strikes?

Have other US presidential administrations carried out analogous extrajudicial killings?

What should the United States government do now?

1. How many individuals have been killed by the US military in this campaign?

As of December 11, 2025, 95 people had been killed in a total of 26 reported miliary strikes. Beginning in September, the Trump administration has carried out these strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, off the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. US officials have not identified any of the people killed.

2. Are these US military strikes lawful under international law?

No. The Trump administration claims that the strikes are carried out in an ongoing armed conflict and that they are lawful attacks on legitimate military targets. However, there is no armed conflict in the Caribbean between the United States and any drug-trafficking organization, and so there is no group of people who are a legitimate military target. Accordingly, US obligations in this context are elaborated under international human rights law, which governs countries’ use of lethal force outside of armed conflict.

The United States has a legitimate interest in preventing drug trafficking into its territory, but this is a matter of law enforcement. Under international human rights standards, law enforcement officials can only deliberately use lethal force when strictly unavoidable to protect lives. The fact that the US government is using military personnel to carry out what should be law enforcement efforts does not make this framework any less applicable.

The deliberate killing of criminal suspects under any other circumstances, and certainly as a deterrent or simply as a convenient alternative to arrest and prosecution, is a grave human rights violation. The US boat strikes constitute extrajudicial killings—unlawful killings carried out by state authorities without any legal justification or process.

That conclusion has also been advanced by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In an earlier statement, the UN special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, and the independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order pointed to the same conclusion.

3. Does the “war on drugs” create legal authority for the United States to use lethal force?

No. The Trump administration asserts that Operation Southern Spear—the US military name for the operation targeting boats—is part of an armed conflict governed by the laws of war.

For decades, US officials have sometimes referred to efforts to combat the trade in and consumption of illegal narcotics as a “war on drugs.” This is a rhetorical construct and not evidence that the US is engaged in an actual armed conflict. Similarly, the mere fact that the Trump administration labels someone a “narco-trafficker” does not make them a legitimate military target.

This reasoning is untenable because the US is not, in reality, engaged in any armed conflict with groups allegedly trafficking drugs from Venezuela and the administration has not even attempted to offer any meaningful evidence to support its position.

The Trump administration maintains that certain drug trafficking groups are sponsored to some degree by the Venezuelan government, but has offered no evidence to support that assertion.. In fact, the “armed conflict” framing transparently appears intended to create a legal justification for strikes that are patently unlawful. But the administration cannot change the legal framework governing its actions simply by asserting the existence of an armed conflict.

4. Are the boat strikes lawful if the Trump administration says they have only killed members of designated foreign terrorist organizations?

No. Labeling groups as designated foreign terrorist organizations does not change US obligations under international law. Applying this label has no bearing on the baseline question of whether the United States is engaged in an armed conflict that these strikes might be a part of. In the absence of an armed conflict, designation as a foreign terrorist organization cannot make individuals legitimate military targets. Instead, that framework has other implications under US law and policy such as permitting the use of asset freezes, visa bans, and limits on material support from US people.

5. What rules apply if this is not an armed conflict?

International human rights law governs the US government’s confrontations with suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and Pacific. These encounters should be—and until very recently had been—approached using a law enforcement paradigm. Prior to the initiation of these lethal strikes, US efforts focused on interdiction, arrest, and prosecution.

International human rights law protects the rights to life and due process, including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the US has ratified. The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials offer clear guidance on when the use of lethal force and weaponry is permissible under international human rights law. That framework makes clear that in the context of any law enforcement effort, the intentional lethal use of force is permissible only when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.

Nothing in US statements or reported facts about these strikes suggests that the deliberate lethal use of force is even arguably appropriate under this framework. US officials have in fact made no effort to justify the killings in these terms. US officials have partly justified the strikes with reference to the harm caused by drug addiction in the United States. This points to no conceivably legitimate rationale for the US government’s stark and sudden shift away from interdiction and arrest to a campaign of deliberate killings.

Further, countries have an obligation under international human rights law to investigate and punish serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings. This obligation flows from the international covenant and is elaborated further under the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions. The US has taken no steps to investigate the killings in line with international human rights law.

6. Has the United States demonstrated an imminent threat justifying the killings?

No. Based on information the administration has released—including its own (edited) videos—there is no indication that the boats or those on board posed an imminent threat to US forces or anyone else.

On September 2, the US military conducted a follow-up strike on the wreckage of a boat that was left helpless after a first strike that left two survivors—a decision on which officials recently briefed Congress. Based on media reports, including by The Intercept and The Washington Post, on the briefings, Admiral Frank Bradley—who oversaw the September 2 operation—said that he believed drugs remained on the boat.

Some officials reportedly argued that survivors might have been trying to “stay in the fight” and could have flipped the boat over and transported the drugs into the United States by getting to land or connecting with another vessel. None of this points to any conceivable argument that it could have been lawful to deliberately kill the two defenseless men. The extrajudicial killing of those two people was instead a particularly egregious violation that should be investigated and punished.

7. Could these killings be considered “war crimes?

No. War crimes are serious violations of international humanitarian law—the “laws of war”— which is an international legal regime only applicable to situations of armed conflict. Calling these strikes “war crimes” wrongly accepts the administration’s narrative that the United States is engaged in some form of armed conflict against alleged drug traffickers. That narrative is not only erroneous but dangerous—the administration is deploying it in an attempt to give itself greater latitude to summarily execute people who should be arrested and tried under criminal law.

These killings are extrajudicial executions committed by the United States.

8. Are US military personnel responsible for these extrajudicial killings?

Maybe. The primary responsibility lies with officials who ordered, authorized, and legally justified the strikes. However, US military personnel may also bear responsibility for unlawful killings.

9. Are other countries that cooperate with the US military complicit in these extrajudicial killings?

Maybe.

Since 2012, 14 countries including the United States have cooperated in a joint law enforcement effort called Campaign Martillo. For over a decade, operations under this multinational counter-narcotics initiative have primarily occurred in international waters or with a host nations’ consent in their territorial seas, emphasizing an interdiction approach.

The International Law Commission, a United Nations expert body mandated to advance the development of international law, in 2001 adopted the Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. The articles, which are widely accepted as reflecting customary international law, provide that a country bears responsibility under international law if it “aids or assists” another country to commit an internationally wrongful act “with knowledge of the circumstances.” It also provides that “the assisting State will only be responsible to the extent that its own conduct has caused or contributed to the internationally wrongful act.”

At this point, it would be hard to claim that participants in Campaign Martillo or Operation Caribbe—Canada’s contribution to US counternarcotics efforts in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific—do not have knowledge of the broader circumstances, including the 21 strikes on vessels killing 83 people. If the intelligence they share is being used by the US military to help identify strike targets, these governments may be complicit in the Trump administration’s extrajudicial killings. Countries should perform due diligence in their maritime cooperation with the United States to ensure that this is not the case.

Nations should publicly state that all nations are bound by international human rights law and call for and support independent investigations into the boat strikes by UN human rights mechanisms and regional bodies. They should make clear that the “war on drugs” framing does not create a battlefield or lawful targetability. Nations should also press the United States to disclose the legal basis for the operations, the criteria used for targeting, the identities and nationalities of those killed, and the findings of any internal investigations.

10. What obligations does the United States have toward the families of those killed and survivors of the strikes?

Under international human rights standards, the United States should identify every person suspected to have been killed in an extrajudicial killing, investigate to determine the circumstances of their death, and provide their families with this information.

The United States must also ensure that each death is subject to a thorough, prompt, and impartial investigation, and that those responsible for unlawful killings are prosecuted and appropriately punished. Families should receive information about how the investigation was conducted and what it found.

When killings are unlawful, as are the boat strikes, the United States is obligated to provide effective remedies, which can take a range of different forms.

The US government has not investigated these unlawful killings, has not disclosed the identities of those killed, and has not notified families.

11. Have other US presidential administrations carried out analogous extrajudicial killings?

Yes. Alongside other nongovernmental organizations, Human Rights Watch has been documenting civilian harm and other abuses by US military forces and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for more than three decades, including under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump (1st term), and Joe Biden.

Under President Bush, the United States dramatically expanded the use of lethal force outside traditional battlefields as part of the “global war on terror” targeting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and “associated forces.” The administration refused to acknowledge specific strikes and rarely investigated deaths. This approach facilitated claims that the US could lawfully target individuals far from active hostilities, even when they posed no imminent threat and were not directly participating in hostilities at the time of the strike.

President Obama expanded lethal drone operations in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. His administration introduced internal policy constraints like a preference for capturing rather than killing suspects and a requirement of “near certainty” that civilians would not be harmed but Human Rights Watch investigations showed that these standards were not consistently met..

During both administrations, Human Rights Watch warned that those legal frameworks risked normalizing lethal force outside war zones and setting dangerous global precedents. President Trump’s first term accelerated this trajectory by loosening targeting constraints, reducing transparency around drone operations, and removing Obama-era reporting requirements for transparency.

The current Trump administration’s boat strike operations mirror these earlier abuses in some ways, but they break new ground in pushing the United States away from even the credible pretense of respect for international law.

12. What should the United States government do now?

The Trump administration should:

Immediately halt its lethal strikes on alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Disclose details on the purported legal basis for these operations.

Identify every person killed, notify the families, and provide appropriate reparations.

Release the criteria used to select targets and information about the identities of those killed.

Prosecute and punish those responsible for the extrajudicial killings to the extent possible under US law.

Congress should intervene urgently. The administration’s lethal boat strikes, conducted without a clear legal basis and outside any armed conflict, demand immediate congressional scrutiny.

The Honorable Chip Roy, Chairman

The Honorable Mary Gay Scanlon, Ranking Member

Subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government

Committee on the Judiciary

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Chairman Roy and Ranking Member Scanlon:

On behalf of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the undersigned 257 civil rights, faith, and nonprofit organizations, we write to express our profound concern about tomorrow’s hearing and the dangerous pattern it represents. We stand united in condemning this effort to discredit an institution that has worked tirelessly to serve our communities, protect our rights, and advance opportunity for all.

We believe that everyone in this country deserves to be treated with dignity—free from discrimination, with real freedom and opportunity—no matter their race, gender, zip code, or background. This promise, however, is not self-executing. It relies on everyday people and community organizations to stand ready to uphold it when it comes under strain.

This hearing is not about any single organization—it is about a broader effort to use government power to silence people. The government is targeting groups that check abuses of power and that ensure that democracy belongs to all of us. This includes civil rights, community-based, humanitarian, and faith-based organizations that speak from deeply held convictions and provide essential services across the country.

This precedent should concern every Member of Congress regardless of party. The same tools used to target one set of organizations today can tomorrow be turned against anyone that a future Congress or administration views as hostile to its political agenda.

Across nearly every sector of public life, the government is rolling back civil rights protections while unlawfully targeting the organizations that defend and strengthen those rights. Civil rights safeguards are being dismantled in voting, education, housing, employment, healthcare, and more. At the same time, nonprofit organizations, advocates, and watchdogs that challenge discrimination and government overreach are being targeted in an effort to push them out of the public square—eroding both legal protections and democratic oversight. We have witnessed:

Threats to designate civil rights and community groups as “domestic terrorists” and revoke their nonprofit status;

Grants terminated without justification or due process;

Targeted government investigations aimed at discouraging lawful speech and chilling public participation;

Public intimidation campaigns designed to isolate and discredit community organizations;

Pressure on law firms, media, corporations, faith leaders, and nonprofits to sever long-standing relationships with vulnerable communities for fear of government retaliation; and

Civil rights laws weaponized against the very communities they were designed to protect.

The tactic is familiar: intimidate independent voices, deflect from the real issues facing the country, and mete out retribution on anyone who dares to challenge those in power. Our nation has seen, across different eras and under administrations of both parties, how governmental power can be misused to suppress dissent—from McCarthy-era investigations to federal surveillance and harassment of civil rights, religious, labor, and anti-war leaders through efforts like the FBI’s COINTELPRO program.

At stake is whether people—regardless of their viewpoint—can express themselves without fear of government retaliation. If organizations and people can be targeted for their analysis, advocacy, or disagreement with those in power, then none are safe.

If we don’t speak out against these attacks, it will clear the path for the dismantling of freedom of speech and civil rights and the repression of dissent.

We urge members of this Committee to reject the abuse of congressional oversight to target organizations for their lawful work. Congress should instead focus on the serious challenges facing the American people.

The event coincides with the 252nd anniversary of the original Boston Tea Party.

Mass 50501 and Boston Indivisible organized the nonviolent action.

State conservation guidelines mandated the use of only environmentally safe, clean ice.

The big picture: The protest targets Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations that have accelerated under the Trump administration.

The theatrical protest is a response to earlier threats from Trump's border czar Tom Homan, who said he'd be ""bringing hell"" to Boston.

Organizers positioned the demonstration as ""modern-day civic action against political tyranny,"" protesting what they describe as ""armed government intimidation"" and advocating for Massachusetts' Safe Communities Act.",https://images.axios.com/XCbF-a0oz_OHsFaqtvKlzWXBJTo=/0x0:3000x1688/1366x768/2025/12/15/1765829580103.jpeg,N,,2025-12-16 13:56:56.472394

A poinsettia garland twined around a staircase bannister, and a red and gold Christmas wreath adorned the facade. A grey and white cat mewed at the front door, asking to be let in. No one answered a knock at the door.

Federal immigration enforcement detained the family that lived at the house in Harbor Pines Mobile Home Community — a mother, father, and at least two young children — on Dec. 4, a neighbor told Mississippi Today.

A video circulated among neighbors that morning showed several people, including one wearing a law enforcement vest, approaching the home. The video, along with accounts of families detained by immigration enforcement shared on social media in the area, has kindled fear among some members of the community.

Rick McKay, who has lived in Harbor Pines for about 20 years, said he wasn’t aware of the arrests but that the neighborhood has been quiet lately, possibly due to a fear of intensified immigration enforcement.

“It might be a little quiet, but it’s winter,” he said.

Fear and uncertainty are spreading through immigrant communities across Mississippi as reports emerge of immigration agents detaining individuals and families. Although this month’s arrests have been more sporadic than those in nearby Louisiana — where federal agents launched the latest immigration crackdown Dec. 3 — their effects have swiftly rippled throughout Mississippi.

The number of people detained in Mississippi is unknown publicly. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to Mississippi Today’s request for comment Friday. And, it’s unclear how or if the recent arrests made in Mississippi are connected to the operation based in New Orleans, dubbed “Catahoula Crunch.”

Tracking arrests of people swept up by federal immigration agents has proven difficult for advocates and families because the agencies directing the crackdown have offered little information about the operation. Nor have local and state law enforcement, even though some have agreements to cooperate with ICE.

Catahoula Crunch, also referred to as Operation Swamp Sweep in planning documents, is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s third major immigration enforcement action this year, following Midway Blitz in Chicago and November’s Charlotte’s Web in Charlotte, North Carolina. Early reports showed the campaign aimed to arrest roughly 5,000 people across Louisiana and southeastern Mississippi.

Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests across southeast Louisiana this month, according to The Associated Press.

DHS said the sweep in New Orleans continues its efforts to arrest “rapists, thieves, gang members, human smugglers, and abusers,” though an AP report identified criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the operation’s first two days.

Some Mississippi leaders, including Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, have embraced the operation, while immigrant communities and advocates said they are bracing themselves.

“We support the president’s efforts in trying to get law and order in our state and in our country,” Reeves said to WAPT Nov. 21.

Lea Campbell, an Ocean Springs resident and member of the Mississippi Gulf Coast Mutual Aid Collective, said the community advocacy group has seen an increased presence of federal immigration officers on the Coast.

“We kind of are preparing for the worst,” Campell said.

‘Something better for their daughters’

Debbie Pierce is one of five women who founded Adelante, a Jackson-based group that provides support to the immigrant community. In recent weeks, she said members have learned that several people they were assisting were detained by ICE, leaving behind empty cars.

The group is also supporting a Brandon woman caring for three children younger than 3 after immigration agents arrested their mother at the end of November while she was on her way to work. ICE records show the woman, Ana Lucas-Pedro, is detained at the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana.

Kitzia, an Adelante member who asked to be identified by her first name, said she has taken donations of food and diapers to the neighbor and children.

“I don’t think she was prepared in any way, shape or form,” Kitzia said of the mother. She said the same of the stand-in caretaker, who is now burdened with caring for three children in addition to her own.

In Ridgeland, a neighbor who asked to remain anonymous for fear of being targeted by law enforcement, identified one person arrested at Harbor Pines Mobile Home Park as Rolando Quintero de la Cruz. ICE records show he was born in Mexico and is being held at the LaSalle Detention Facility in Jena, Louisiana.

His wife, Jennifer Luis-Hernandez is being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, according to ICE records. Mississippi Today was not able to locate the children, and immigration detention records are not available for minors.

ICE did not respond to questions about how many people, or if any children, were detained in the arrest.

The South Texas Family Residential Center was built in 2014 to house families, but President Joe Biden’s administration halted the practice of family detention, and the facility held only adults until it closed in 2024. It reopened in March, retrofitted to house children again.

The family moved to the U.S. a few years ago to improve their quality of life and “look for something better for their daughters,” Maricruz Nostroza Dionisio, a family friend, said in Spanish in a message to Mississippi Today.

Alex Gibert, a spokesperson for the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services, said the process for bringing any child, regardless of immigration status, into state custody remains the same.

Concern for a child’s safety would need to first be reported to a statewide hotline, which would lead the department to conduct an investigation, she said in a Friday statement. From there, the agency can make recommendations for the youth court, and a judge can issue a custody order.

How sightings affect the community

Immigration agents in unmarked vehicles and vests have been spotted from the Jackson metro area to the Coast, community advocates say.

Campbell said people have seen an uptick of Customs and Border Protection vans and trucks, especially by exits along Interstate 10, and in downtown Biloxi and Gulfport.

Pierce, of Adelente, said agents have been seen in Canton, Madison and Pelahatchie in Madison and Rankin counties in central Mississippi.

Jeremy Litton, an immigration attorney, said ICE or CBP agents continue to be seen in Forest, which is an hour east of Jackson, weeks after two back-to-back sightings of officers near businesses that serve the Latino community.

The increased presence of federal immigration officials, paired with news of detainments, has led to some immigrants staying home and not attending school or church, advocates said.

Michael Oropeza, executive director of El Pueblo, a nonprofit serving low-income immigrant communities in Mississippi, said the organization cancelled its annual Hispanic festival fundraiser and stopped holding in-person education events out of fear for the community.

News of immigration raids ripples beyond the place where enforcement activity occurs, she said.

“When there’s a raid in one town, fear is going to spread to others in real time,” Oropeza said.

Advocates respond with aid, information

Advocates and community groups say they are helping immigrants in a variety of ways: bringing groceries to them so they don’t have to go to the store, offering assistance with transportation and connecting them to legal services.

Pierce, of Adelante, is helping to tutor the children of immigrants in the Jackson area. She hopes the church they are using can continue to be a safe space for them.

Campbell said volunteers for the Mississippi Gulf Coast Mutual Aid Collective take students home from a Biloxi afterschool program, so parents do not have to risk contact with immigration agents.

The Gulf Coast group also collects information about the presence of immigration agents in public spaces and shares the reports through social media.

Community groups are also offering resources and education for the greater community, such as “know your rights” training.

The presence of federal immigration officers in Mississippi creates a climate of fear that undermines immigrants’ sense of safety, even among those not directly being targeted, Oropeza said.

“It just breaks down institutional trust with schools and hospitals and even local law enforcement, which is scary,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47653/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/15102542/home-and-bikes-dec.-12-Kate-Royals1765899793.jpg?h=84071268&itok=baCq4jG7,N,,2025-12-16 10:59:05.637670

Maura Healey is demanding that immigration enforcement authorities ""immediately stop"" using Hanscom Field airport to fly detainees out of state.

In a letter dated Dec. 12 to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, the governor called ICE's use of Hanscom to remove people from the state ""part of its disturbing and anti-American deportation tactics.""

WBUR has reported on hundreds of detainees being shuttled to the Bedford airport from Plymouth County jail to board ICE flights. People arrested by immigration agents in the Boston area are often flown in private jets to Louisiana or Texas, in many cases without notice to their families or lawyers.

ICE's use of Hanscom for immigration flights has garnered protests in the past. The agency temporarily stopped using the airfield in late July, but began detainee flights again in September as part of a surge in immigration enforcement in the state. ICE did not explain at the time why it paused flights from Hanscom.

Healey noted in the letter that a ""significant majority"" of people detained by ICE in Massachusetts over the past year ""have no criminal convictions or charges."" She said flying them far from their support systems and legal counsel ""often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed.""

The governor closed her letter demanding that ICE ""immediately stop using any Massachusetts airports and private jets to deport residents and obstruct due process, and to halt this practice across this country.""

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Massachusetts Port Authority, a quasi-public agency, operates Hanscom. In a statement, a Massport spokeswoman said “ICE flights"" are charter flights operated out of the airport.:

""Massport does not receive prior knowledge of these flights, nor does the Authority have a role in their operation,"" she said.

She said Massport ""cannot discriminate who can or cannot use the airport. Public use airports like Hanscom are required to accommodate all flights to the airport, including those by or on behalf of the federal government.""

When members of Congress attack law clinics for defending constitutional rights, they are following the same script.
Law clinics in the United States are increasingly becoming entangled in this transnational trend, signaling a concerning alignment with global patterns of democratic backsliding.
Trump-aligned members of Congress targeting law clinics do so precisely because of this critical role they play.
Law schools—and especially law clinics—are indispensable to this work.","Less than a year into Trump’s second administration, the attack on democratic institutions is palpable. Among the most alarming targets are law school clinics—programs where students provide vital legal services to those who cannot afford them. In recent months, congressional investigations and political grandstanding have singled out public-interest clinics at major universities not for misconduct, but for the clients they serve.

In March, the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce launched an investigation into Northwestern University’s law clinics, demanding detailed records from over 20 legal clinics and centers. The inquiry included internal budgets, funding sources, the personnel file of a clinic director, and all payments made to outside entities since 2020.

The catalyst was a clinic’s representation of organizers of a pro-Palestinian protest that blocked traffic at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport in April 2024. After the House Committee sent its letter, Northwestern filed a federal lawsuit arguing the congressional inquiry violated the Constitution’s guarantees of free speech, due process, equal protection, and the right to counsel. Only after public outcry and legal pushback did the House quietly drop the inquiry. That withdrawal ended the immediate dispute but left a chilling message: represent the “wrong” client, and your school could face federal scrutiny.

A few months later the same Committee held a hearing questioning university leaders from Georgetown University, U.C. Berkeley, and the City University of New York (CUNY). During the hearing, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) questioned the employment of a professor who directs the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (CLEAR) Clinic at CUNY School of Law, which provides three primary services free of charge: legal representation and consultation; know-your-rights workshops; and support for community organizing. During the hearing, Stefanik called for the clinic’s director to be fired for providing legal representation to individuals like Mahmoud Khalil, who was detained for participating in peaceful protests for Palestinians’ rights and whom the administration is still seeking to re-detain and deport.

Let’s be clear: representing Mr. Khalil is also a defense of the Constitution, which guarantees every person—citizen or not—the rights to free speech, due process, and a fair hearing. Recently, the Equality Justice Clinic at CUNY Law also joined a First Amendment lawsuit on his behalf, arguing that the U.S. government has used the threat of legal sanctions and other forms of coercion to suppress disfavored speech.

Taken together, these actions reflect a broader strategy of intimidating clinics by targeting the very clients whose representation is most essential to the rule of law.

Public interest law clinics are cornerstones of legal education and democratic accountability. They train the next generation of lawyers and provide representation to individuals and communities otherwise voiceless in the legal system. From housing disputes to immigration defense to civil rights litigation, legal clinics often provide a last line of defense for the most vulnerable—people facing eviction, deportation, loss of health care, gender-based violence, surveillance, or discrimination.

Importantly, law school clinics are not theoretical exercises—they engage in the actual practice of law and are a core part of the legal system itself. Faculty and students working within these clinics operate under the same professional responsibility rules that govern licensed attorneys, including duties of confidentiality, loyalty, and zealous representation. As such, any political interference with clinic advocacy risks not only academic freedom but also ethical and constitutional obligations owed to clients.

This is not a partisan issue. The right to legal representation, especially for the most vulnerable, is a foundational principle of American justice that has historically drawn support from across the political spectrum. Attacks on legal clinics for representing marginalized clients—whether immigrants, incarcerated individuals, or low-income defendants—not only misrepresent the role of public interest law, but also run counter to the core values long embraced by both Democratic and Republican traditions. Conservative and liberal jurists alike have recognized that access to counsel and equal protection under the law are fundamental constitutional guarantees. From the landmark Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) decision to modern-day rulings, the principle that everyone deserves a fair defense has been repeatedly upheld. While some actors may now seek to narrow or reinterpret these rights, that effort is a departure from—not a continuation of—the broader bipartisan legacy of support for clinic legal advocacy.

In cases like the Northwestern case, Bedi v. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, courts have been called upon to assess whether congressional inquiries into the work of law school clinics infringe upon First Amendment protections. These cases illustrate that such inquiries are not routine congressional oversight. Rather, the inquiries implicate core constitutional guarantees, including academic freedom, freedom of expression, and the right to provide legal representation unencumbered by political interference. The right to a legal defense—even for the most marginalized or controversial—is a defining feature separating democracy from dictatorship.

These attacks may feel uniquely American, but they follow a pattern that’s becoming all too familiar around the world. Anyone following the global erosion of democracy will recognize these tactics. In Hungary, Viktor Orbán’s government expelled the Central European University and cracked down on independent institutions. In India, the Modi government has arrested students and professors under anti-terrorism laws for dissent. In Turkey, President Erdoğan’s administration has dismissed thousands of academics and shut down universities under the guise of national security.

The through-line is clear: governments seeking to consolidate power often begin by undermining institutions that cultivate independent judgment and critical inquiry. When members of Congress attack law clinics for defending constitutional rights, they are following the same script.

These tactics reflect a broader global pattern of institutional interference, wherein government actors deploy legal and administrative mechanisms to undermine academic autonomy and suppress forms of advocacy perceived as politically oppositional. Law clinics in the United States are increasingly becoming entangled in this transnational trend, signaling a concerning alignment with global patterns of democratic backsliding.

Authoritarians attack educational institutions because an informed public equipped with critical thinking skills threatens their hold on power. Law clinics teach critical inquiry and values of service and justice. When students represent the marginalized—those denied healthcare, displaced from homes, silenced in court—they embody democracy’s core. Trump-aligned members of Congress targeting law clinics do so precisely because of this critical role they play. They seem untroubled by the fact that these attacks are recycling familiar authoritarian tactics.

The current attacks echo earlier efforts to curtail clinic independence. In the early 2000s, the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic in Louisiana became a national flashpoint after it assisted local residents in challenging the siting of a polyvinyl chloride plant in a Black community. In response, then-Governor Mike Foster and industry allies pushed for regulatory changes that severely limited the clinic’s capacity to serve clients, forcing clinics across the country to reckon with new legal and political risks. These efforts were not about misconduct, but about silencing advocacy that threatened corporate and political interests. The current wave of attacks echoes this history, using the machinery of government to chill dissent and dismantle institutions designed to empower ordinary people.

These moments exemplify a recurring strategy aimed at neutralizing legal resistance through systemic disempowerment—manifested in funding constraints, encroachments on academic freedom, and the imposition of external oversight over case selection. Such measures are not designed to enhance institutional governance, but rather to suppress dissenting voices and curtail oppositional advocacy.

What is needed now is not fewer clinics, but more of them. The U.S. needs to strengthen civic education, protect academic freedom, and invest in institutions that uphold democratic governance. A clear and collective commitment to democratic renewal—both domestically and globally—is essential.

Domestically, this means safeguarding the independence of universities and other institutions, protecting advocates and lawyers, and expanding public access to legal representation—especially for marginalized and politically unpopular clients. How so? By enacting legislation that shields law clinics and legal educators from political retribution for the clients they represent. States and Congress should establish clear protections for clinical faculty, students, and university programs against coercive oversight or retaliation based solely on the substance of their advocacy. Universities must reaffirm policies that guarantee academic freedom and clinic autonomy in case selection, free from donor or political interference. Bar associations and legal institutions should strengthen professional protections for lawyers—including students—who face threats or career consequences for taking on disfavored cases. And crucially, public funding for legal clinics and indigent defense must be expanded, not cut, to ensure equal access to justice is not reserved for the politically convenient.

At the global level, authoritarian forces are networked and increasingly coordinated in consolidating their power. Countering this trend demands an international movement for rights—one that treats democracy as a collective, global endeavor rather than a purely domestic concern. Legal scholars, activists, educators, and students across borders should build transnational coalitions not only to exchange strategies, but to develop new legal frameworks, and coordinate responses to democratic erosion—just as authoritarians themselves have become increasingly global in their tactics. These coalitions could connect law school clinics, human rights lawyers, and legal educators to share litigation models, create rapid-response legal toolkits, and defend colleagues facing political retaliation. While global networks like the Global Alliance for Justice Education and the International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations offer starting points, what is urgently needed now is a purpose-built legal-defense alliance and infrastructure capable of confronting authoritarian threats that transcend national borders.

Democracy doesn’t crumble overnight. It erodes through institutional attacks, cultural repression, and political intimidation. When law students or their professors are punished for defending unpopular clients, when universities are threatened for teaching critical thinking, and when lawyers are surveilled or sanctioned for their advocacy—these are all warning signs.

Renewing democracy demands more than vigilance. It demands deep investment in the institutions that cultivate critical thinking, civic engagement, and a commitment to justice. Law schools—and especially law clinics—are indispensable to this work. Protecting them is not just about preserving education. It’s about ensuring a future where rights are upheld, representation matters, and justice is not a privilege, but a guarantee.

* * *

What Americans are witnessing is a concerted effort to delegitimize legal defense for marginalized or politically disfavored people—and to send a warning to law students and educators against challenging state power. This is a dangerous precedent. As others have shown, this pattern is not new. Clinics have historically faced attacks from elected officials, donors, and political actors seeking to silence advocacy that threatens powerful interests. Across contexts–whether in environmental justice, immigrant rights, or civil liberties–the common denominator is interference aimed at suppressing dissent through legal intimidation.

These attacks are not isolated incidents—they are part of a broader authoritarian playbook aimed at silencing dissent, weakening the rule of law, and undermining democracy itself.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Northwestern_Law_Levy_Mayer_Hall1.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 10:59:11.470109

The revised law was adopted after a flawed and untransparent policy process, Human Rights Watch said.
The proposed changes, made public only in February 2025, weakened key provisions of the corporate accountability law, making it harder for victims of rights abuses to sue companies.
Overall, the changes have reduced the number of EU corporate groups covered by the law by 70 percent, from 3,363 to 980.
“The amended law is far from the groundbreaking corporate accountability law that it set out to be,” de Rengervé said.","(Brussels) – The European Parliament’s approval on December 16, 2025, of final amendments watering down the European Union’s flagship corporate accountability law severely undermines the EU’s ability to hold businesses accountable for human rights and environmental harms, Human Rights Watch said today.

The vote on the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive draws to a close eight months of intense industry lobbying, a nontransparent policy process, and chaotic negotiations. The changes reduce the number of companies covered by the law and delete companies’ obligation to implement climate transition plans.

“All that is left of the EU’s trailblazing corporate accountability law is a skeleton,” said Helene de Rengervé, senior corporate accountability advocate at Human Rights Watch. “The final text means corporate interests are being prioritized over the rights of workers, communities, and environmental protection.”

The original corporate accountability law, adopted in 2024 and due to become binding on businesses in 2026, required large companies with more than 1,000 employees located or operating in the EU to tackle human rights and environmental harm throughout their global supply chains.

European institutions have now agreed, however, to delay the requirement for EU member states to transpose the directive into national law to July 2028, with the law now only becoming binding on companies in July 2029.

The revised law was adopted after a flawed and untransparent policy process, Human Rights Watch said. The process began on November 8, 2024, when EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a fleet of so-called Omnibus laws to simplify the European Green Deal. The proposed changes, made public only in February 2025, weakened key provisions of the corporate accountability law, making it harder for victims of rights abuses to sue companies.

Lobbying by European and US companies, especially the fossil fuel industry, heavily influenced the Commission’s proposals. US companies also successfully lobbied President Donald Trump for his administration to seek to have the law watered down as part of trade negotiations with the EU.

Civil society was largely excluded from the process. The EU Ombudswoman found that the EU Commission provided insufficient justification for invoking a need for urgency and for introducing the changes without ensuring the transparent, evidence-based, and inclusive preparation of legislative proposals. This violated the Commission’s own principles of good law and amounted to maladministration. What has happened has put the EU’s credibility at risk, Human Rights Watch said.

Human Rights Watch and 170 other civil society organizations, as well as dozens of businesses and investors, opposed the changes in the Omnibus law. European governments and the European Parliament, however, ultimately adopted many of the amendments, with centrist political parties voting in the parliament with far-right parties to approve them.

The amended law does preserve some important requirements, including the core obligation for companies to set up meaningful human rights and environmental due diligence processes over their entire supply chain. An earlier proposal to limit the scope of the due diligence only to direct suppliers was ultimately rejected.

Companies will also still have to implement a risk-based approach, prioritizing intervention in the most severe cases first, while being obliged to address all existing or potential abuses uncovered in their supply chain.

Companies will no longer be required, however, to implement climate transition plans to monitor and ultimately reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the landmark Paris Climate Agreement, which EU countries ratified. Companies covered by the law, even with its reduced scope, are responsible for the equivalent of almost two-thirds of the EU’s total annual emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), based on a recent study.

Overall, the changes have reduced the number of EU corporate groups covered by the law by 70 percent, from 3,363 to 980. The changes also deleted a requirement for member states to develop a uniform system for holding companies accountable in EU courts for human rights abuses, complicating victims’ access to justice.

“The amended law is far from the groundbreaking corporate accountability law that it set out to be,” de Rengervé said. “But communities, workers, and civil society partners should still use what is left of the law to fight for justice for victims of corporate abuses worldwide.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/12/202512eca_belgium_corporate_accountability_march.jpg?h=66f48909&itok=a-FsX6nd,N,,2025-12-16 10:01:14.429529

John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators.","Some Republicans in Congress are splitting from the Trump administration over its crackdown on legal immigration from Afghanistan, especially for those migrants who helped U.S. war efforts there.

Over the past year, the U.S. has paused visa and other programs for Afghan nationals, among others. Those already in the country have also been stripped of temporary permission to stay.

Further immigration restrictions followed after an Afghan national was charged in the deadly shooting of a National Guard member in Washington, D.C., last month.

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., cautioned against a ""knee-jerk reaction"" that could block a number of Afghans with valid cases for temporary or permanent immigration status from coming to the U.S.

""One thing we've forgotten is how important that is for our special operators,"" Tillis said, referencing examples of his own constituents with deep attachments to Afghans abroad. ""It puts them in a more dangerous spot if we lose sight of that.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, also worried about the impact on Afghans from the cuts.

""There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops,"" Collins said. ""I've talked to veterans who have been very concerned about the safety of Afghans who have helped us. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting than occurred during the Biden administration.""

The GOP divisions come as President Trump spent the bulk of his 2024 presidential campaign vowing to launch the largest deportation effort in American history.

Some Republicans have also pushed back against changes to visa programs for migrant laborers and in favor of more permanent status for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

Afghan soldiers who assisted U.S. troops have, in the past, enjoyed bipartisan support for their immigration cases.

Meanwhile, Trump has promoted the idea that only some people are welcome in the U.S.

""I've also announced a permanent pause on Third World migration, including from hellholes like Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and many other countries,"" Trump said last week at an event in Pennsylvania.

Policy changes throughout the year

On his first day in office, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program, effectively stranding thousands of people already approved to come to the U.S.

This included Afghans who had helped U.S. troops, immigration advocates said. Afghanistan was one of the top countries sending refugees to the U.S. in fiscal year 2024, according to Homeland Security Department data; out of just over 100,000 refugees admitted that year, 14,680 were from Afghanistan.

Some Republicans first raised concern about the pause's impact on those who had assisted U.S. armed forces.

The refugee program has since been significantly scaled back, and the target demographic for entrants is now white South Africans, according to the administration.

In June, Trump added Afghanistan to a list of 19 countries for which travel to the U.S. would be restricted.

And after the attack on National Guard members in D.C. around Thanksgiving, the Trump administration paused processing asylum cases, green cards and other immigration services for those from the countries listed in June's travel ban. It also paused processing all visas specifically for Afghans.

Trump has argued that those who came from Afghanistan were not properly vetted under the Biden administration.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, the man charged in connection with the shooting, was admitted to the U.S. in 2021 under the Biden administration's Operation Allies Welcome program. He was then granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration.

""This animal would've never been here if not for Joe Biden's dangerous policies which allowed countless unvetted criminals to invade our country and harm the American people,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in response to a request for comment about the Republican divisions.

It is not clear what could have been uncovered through additional vetting before Lakanwal arrived to the U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the suspect could have been radicalized after coming to the U.S. At the same time, advocates have long criticized agencies such as the CIA and DHS for failing to provide resources, including for mental health, for Afghan soldiers transitioning to life in America after experiencing harrowing violence.

Questions about Congress's role

Immigrant advocacy groups accuse lawmakers of ceding their power to the president when it comes to immigration policy.

""Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight,"" Shawn VanDiver, the founder of the organization AfghanEvac, which advocates for Afghans who worked with U.S. troops, said during a press conference. ""Failing to modernize the asylum, refugee, or [special immigrant visa] systems. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fear-mongering, not facts; politics, not policy.""

Congress this year has passed very few immigration-related bills, mostly focusing on funding the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement efforts. Many other legislative efforts to facilitate or reform immigration processes have been at a standstill.

But some Republicans are happy to leave immigration in the administration's hands.

""Primarily, that's an executive branch issue,"" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, said about the vetting process of Afghans and other immigrants.

""Our staff are not the ones that are actually doing the vetting. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point.""

Republican leaders also appear aligned with the Trump administration on the topic.

House Republicans stripped a bipartisan provision from the National Defense Authorization Act that would have brought back an office at the State Department that relocates Afghan refugees. The legislation passed the House last week and is set for a Senate vote this week.

""Republican leadership tanked months of bipartisan work,"" Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., who introduced the provision, said in a statement. ""It is truly shameful that my Republican colleagues, some of whom served in Afghanistan and uniquely understand the debt we owe our allies, have once again put blind loyalty to Trump over American principles and obligations.""

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., told NPR that one solution to the question of Afghan vetting would be to pass the ""Fulfilling Promises to Afghan Allies Act,"" which provides a pathway for Afghans to apply for legal permanent residency, following additional vetting, and is supported by senators of both parties. The bill was introduced in August, but has not seen a committee vote.

""I'd like to see the bill that I sponsored, which would have increased vetting on anybody applying here, to take effect before we make another decision,"" Cassidy said.

Still, enthusiasm to tackle anything immigration-related in this Congress is low.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, has in the past supported measures for special immigrant visas for Afghan military interpreters and translators. But he told NPR that now is not the right time to restart that conversation, without elaborating on his reasons.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5682x3196+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2Ff4%2F65a81c004250b4516e1b69175a7e%2Fgettyimages-2236362920.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 08:56:22.349342

In the Atlanta area, administrators have been telling teachers not to talk about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We have heard this from teachers in JOLT Atlanta, a justice-oriented teacher collective, and from teachers in the Atlanta Association of Raza Educators. One teacher shared that an administrator at a DeKalb County school instructed them to remove from the board a hotline number for a community organization supporting immigrant families. This administrator told teachers to focus on teaching content, assuming that teachers were not teaching academic content through students’ lived experiences. Part of the rationale was that talking about ICE makes students feel anxious and unsafe.

Indianapolis Public Schools plans on changing its policies to address a lawsuit from Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita that claims the district impeded federal immigration enforcement.

In a court filing last month, the district said it was in the process of changing its policies at the heart of the lawsuit, which took aim at a 2017 resolution directing employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts without the superintendent’s approval.

It’s unclear what policies the district plans to change. In response to questions from Chalkbeat, the district last week referred to a previous statement that reiterated its “non-negotiable” commitment to the safety of its students. But that 2017 resolution, which reaffirmed the district’s commitment to a safe environment for students regardless of immigration status, is no longer on the district’s website.

A link to that resolution was on an IPS web page that Rokita also targeted that provided support for undocumented students and families. That web page is no longer online. It assured families that the district does not ask students about their immigration status and adhered to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act that keeps student records private. ICE officers must generally provide a judicial warrant to enter school grounds, the website said.

Rokita sued the district in November, alleging that IPS policies hindered the deportation of a “Honduran national” who opted to voluntarily leave the country in January with his son, an IPS student. Those policies, he argued, violated state law that prohibits governmental entities from restricting immigration enforcement laws.

In a court hearing on Monday, Ken Falk of the ACLU of Indiana, which is representing IPS, said that the school board will vote on the policy changes around mid-January. Those changes could address Rokita’s concerns and render the lawsuit moot.

Marion County Judge John Chavis agreed to give the district until Feb. 2 to respond to the complaint. The district will also share the policy changes with the attorney general’s office by that date, after which the office could either decide that the changes satisfy state law or continue the lawsuit.

Last month, the district said in its filing that it does not concede that the policies are in violation of state law.

The changes come as schools deal with the fallout from ramped-up immigration enforcement during President Donald Trump’s second term. During Trump’s first term, IPS and districts nationwide moved to protect undocumented students on school grounds by adopting various resolutions committing to their safety.

The lawsuit claims that the student disregarded his father’s desire to leave the country and went to school on Jan. 8, the day of the father’s scheduled deportation flight. When Immigrations and Customs Enforcement contacted IPS to “help the father take custody of his son,” the district refused to release the child to ICE without a judicial warrant or court order.

“ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as the father had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order,” Rokita said in the complaint.

The lawsuit also claimed that the district adopted an “officer response protocol” in early 2025 that directed staff not to share information on the immigration status of students, family members, or staff members with federal authorities.

In the lawsuit, Rokita argued that the district could still allow ICE on school grounds without a warrant.

The school board and community members have criticized Rokita’s lawsuit, calling it a political stunt. The school board has also launched an online petition about the issue.

“While political posturing may seek to divide, we remain united in our belief that education should never be weaponized or politicized,” says the petition, which has over 2,500 signatures.",https://www.chalkbeat.org/resizer/v2/7WXTT4AEHVANVDGKY7PVEWXETI.JPG?smart=true&auth=77e5d6f3a2cdc8806f34598f9173012177cd0bf5939faa6466d52304f4454244&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-12-16 06:59:44.501900

Person enters the country or stays in the country illegally.
ICE finds and arrests the person and begins the deportation process.
One administration chose to ignore the law and their illegal status.
Some want to ignore the illegal status because these people have lived among us for a few years and see they are good people.","The illegal immigrant situation sure is tough one. But I can’t help but think it is very important to separate emotion from logic and status. Are the arrests traumatic to watch or to endure? Perhaps both?

But focusing on the drama of the arrest and ignoring the logical facts misses things that are important. You did a pretty good job pointing some of this out in your article. But any discussion of “dignity” should really factor in the complete story.

Person enters the country or stays in the country illegally. This means they came here and did not follow the legal process to become a citizen. They took a chance. A very big one.

If they have an Order for Deportation [that means] that they received due process, and a judge decided the person needs to go back home and issued such an order.

The person ignores this order and decides to build a life here and establish a new home and they know that it could very easily be taken away.

The person also ignores the warnings from the administration to self deport. Person decides to stay and risk it all anyway.

ICE finds and arrests the person and begins the deportation process. Maybe said person even expected it and just tried to stay as long as possible. One administration chose to ignore the law and their illegal status. Another administration chooses to enforce it.

We as observers and citizens feel bad for the person, and people who had to watch the arrest struggle with it. Some want to ignore the illegal status because these people have lived among us for a few years and see they are good people. Some want everyone to follow the rules and immigrate legally, especially those that followed the rules and did it the right way. And we all want immigrants to be legal contributing members of society. We all seem to want to deport people who commit crimes, especially violent ones. But can we tell and know that just by watching an arrest?

Some people are asking for these arrests to be done with more dignity, right? What would they like to see that shows dignity to the arrestee? Not handled roughly? I think that could be reasonable, but it all depends on how the arrestee behaves. Do they make the process easy or difficult? Clearly the most dignified path is the self-deportation path.

However, I can’t help but wonder if any arrest ever happens with much dignity. It is a tough situation regardless. Any arrest. The event would surely be influenced by any resistance from the person. Unless perhaps the person freely gives themselves up and turns themselves in so ICE and police can apply the cuffs without any resistance and out of the sight of others. That is all within their control right now.

I like to ask myself, what if I went to another country on a visa and overstayed and then tried to establish a life there. What would I or should I expect? Should they let me stay because I’m nice and found a job? Should I expect to be sent home? How should I be treated when they arrest me? What if I run away? Honest answers to these types of questions should help us decide what to do here.

The bill, LD 1971, was passed by both chambers of the Maine Legislature in June. Under LD 1971, Maine law enforcement agencies would no longer be allowed to arrest or detain a person for immigration purposes. The legislation also bars correctional facilities from informing ICE that a person who may be undocumented is being held at that facility.

Mills decided in July to delay her decision on the legislation until the beginning of the next session.

In the op-ed, Mills called the bill ""imperfect"" but said the state cannot ""turn a blind eye to ICE's unacceptable actions.""

Mills also announced that she formally repealed a 2011 executive order issued by former Gov. Paul LePage that called for enhanced cooperation between state and federal officials on immigration enforcement.

""Under any other president, this may be acceptable, but under this Trump administration, it has become a broad and dangerous promise that Maine will not make,"" Mills said in the op-ed.

According to Mills, she lost the ability to sign LD 1971 because she decided to continue to consider the bill past the 10-day window she had to sign it and the Legislature had adjourned sine die, so her only choices were to allow it to become law without her signature or veto it.

Mills noted in the op-ed that her concerns about the bill's impact on law enforcement remain. She said LD 1971 imposes confusing restraints on Maine law enforcement officers about when they can and cannot interact with federal authorities.

Maine Rep. Deqa Dhalac, a Democrat from South Portland who sponsored LD 1971, said she appreciates that Mills will allow the bill to become law. But Dhalac also said she was disappointed that Mills decided to wait this long.

""When the Legislature enacted this bill last June, we made it clear that defining the boundaries between state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities was critical to safeguarding our communities.

""This new law will protect the dignity, due process and public safety of all who call our state home.""

Dhalac said LD 1971 clarifies that local and state agencies can continue working with federal partners to investigate serious crimes, including terrorism, drug trafficking and human trafficking.

Maine House Republicans have issued a statement condemning Mills' decision to allow LD 1971 to become law.

""Limiting cooperation between Maine law enforcement and federal authorities — a longstanding tradition due to Maine's extensive foreign border — shows a reckless disregard for public safety and will put Maine's public at risk,"" the House Republicans said in their statement.

The rejected contract would have allowed Key Lime Air to lease 1,200 square feet of storage equipment space at the airport.
The organization has been tracking ICE flights with Key Lime since they started operating these types of flights in September.
Key Lime Air operates flights out of Centennial Airport, where its headquarters and maintenance facilities are located.
""I will not have my name as Amanda Sandoval on a Key Lime thing that says we are deporting people, and we support that.""","DENVER, Colorado — Denver City Council voted on Monday evening to reject a lease expansion for Key Lime Air at Denver International Airport, citing moral objections to the airline's involvement in immigration enforcement operations. While the resolution was voted down, council members acknowledged it was more of a symbolic vote.

The rejected contract would have allowed Key Lime Air to lease 1,200 square feet of storage equipment space at the airport.

""What we invest in is a value document and at this point in time with the current actions by Key Lime Air, there is no way ethically or morally that I can vote affirmatively,"" Councilmember Stacie Gilmore said.

According to Human Rights First, the airline operated 11% of charter planes for deportation or detention transfers in the month of November. The organization has been tracking ICE flights with Key Lime since they started operating these types of flights in September. Key Lime Air operates flights out of Centennial Airport, where its headquarters and maintenance facilities are located. They also operate out of Denver International Airport.

""They are making money off of deporting and transferring immigrants, separating them from their families,"" said Brandon Gehrke-Quintanilla of Aurora Unidos CSO, one of several advocacy groups that have pushed for action against the airline.

Council members acknowledged the vote carries more symbolic weight than practical consequence.

""We have to make those changes and this is one of those steps, but it doesn't negate the fact that these flights will probably still continue,"" Councilmember Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez said.

Councilmember Kevin Flynn noted that rejecting the lease means the airline will use common-use areas at the airport for free, resulting in no revenue collection for Denver.

But for some council members, the decision reflected deeply held values.

""I am not going to fund the deportation industrial complex anymore with our city dollars,"" Councilmember Amanda Sandoval said. ""I will not have my name as Amanda Sandoval on a Key Lime thing that says we are deporting people, and we support that.""

Gilmore said she has been tracking Key Lime's activities and questioned whether DIA leadership adequately considered the implications before bringing the contract forward.

""When we know that people's constitutional rights are being violated by a greedy air carrier that they are trying to fill a gap and they are deporting people. It's an easy 'no' for me,"" Gilmore said.

Councilmember Sarah Parady framed the vote as Denver's response to federal immigration policies.

Key Lime flies passenger flights only out of Centennial, but the company owns another airline called Denver Air Connection that operates out of DIA.
Key Lime also provides cargo feeder services to UPS at Denver’s airport, for which it was seeking to lease the space.
The CEO of Key Lime Air, Cliff Honeycutt, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the council vote Monday night.
Key Lime Air operated 83 flights across the country for ICE in September, Colorado Newsline reported.","The Denver City Council rejected a contract with Colorado-based airline Key Lime Air on Monday over the company’s work helping carry out President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation efforts.

The denial won’t affect the company’s ability to fly in and out of Centennial Airport in the south suburbs, however, or to continue its work for the federal government.

The rejected contract would have allowed Key Lime Air, which has operated charter services in Colorado since at least 2006, to use 1,200 square feet of storage space at Denver International Airport, said airport spokesman George Karayiannakis.

Key Lime flies passenger flights only out of Centennial, but the company owns another airline called Denver Air Connection that operates out of DIA. Key Lime also provides cargo feeder services to UPS at Denver’s airport, for which it was seeking to lease the space.

Eleven of the council’s 13 members voted against the contract.

“It may seem like any other business decision … but it’s just not. We know that people are being deported without due process,” Councilwoman Jamie Torres said in explaining her “no” vote.

The CEO of Key Lime Air, Cliff Honeycutt, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the council vote Monday night. The value of the rejected lease for DIA was not clear, since it was based on the airport’s standard lease rates and charges.

“As a matter of policy, we are unable to discuss our charter operations,” Honeycutt said in a statement to the Daily Camera earlier this month. “Our focus remains on conducting ALL Key Lime Air flights in accordance with the highest federally mandated safety standards.”

Councilman Kevin Flynn cast the sole “yes” vote; Councilman Chris Hinds, who appeared remotely for the meeting, was absent for that vote. Flynn said he was also appalled by the deportation efforts but added that rejecting the contract wouldn’t help the city.

“If we vote it down, the consequence is only that they have to store (equipment) in the common use area,” he said. “So voting it down means they won’t be paying us, they’ll be using it for free.”

Colorado Newsline first reported that Key Lime Air was transporting detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in October. Since then, the company has been the focus of protests at the airport and at the University of Colorado Boulder, which has a contract with the airline to fly its sports teams to away games.

When asked whether the school would cancel its contract with the company — currently set to last through 2029 — a CU spokesman told the Daily Camera only that the school uses a competitive bidding process when selecting air charters. Spokesman Steve Hurlbert said the university doesn’t ask its contractors to provide a list of other business relationships.

Key Lime Air operated 83 flights across the country for ICE in September, Colorado Newsline reported. More than 115 deportation flights have departed from Denver this year, according to Colorado Public Radio.

Several council members spoke against the DIA contract Monday, specifically calling out the company’s association with ICE.

“I have to sign these deals when we’re done … I will not have my name ‘Amanda Sandoval’ on a Key Lime thing,” said Council President Amanda Sandoval. “I feel very, very, very adamant about that.”

Councilman Darrell Watson said he believes the deportations ICE is carrying out are illegal and that his district wouldn’t support the contract.

“They are not supportive of any action that could even provide any credence to the administration and these illegal raids on our communities,” he said.

Trump initiated a nationwide immigration crackdown when he entered office for his second term earlier this year. Those efforts have included hundreds of thousands of deportations. Lawyers, politicians and activists have criticized the process as illegal and lacking due process, and a judge last month ordered ICE agents in the state to follow restrictions in the law in making immigration arrests.

Monday’s vote could put DIA at risk of losing out on $90 million in annual grants from the Federal Aviation Administration, said Councilwoman Sarah Parady. Under that grant, the city isn’t allowed to treat airlines differently.

Still, she said, “that’s a large number that’s coming out of an extremely healthy airport budget.”

The airport’s budget is kept separate from the rest of the city’s finances. It relies on self-generated revenue from fees and other income, including from airlines and passengers.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TDP-Z-KeyLime23_251189810.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-16 07:00:03.794968

The new fee does not apply to existing H-1B visa holders, only to new recipients.
Congress currently limits the number of H-1B visas available to bachelor’s degree-holders each year to 65,000, and makes available 20,000 visas for applicants holding a master’s degree or higher.
Public universities in Oregon are dependent on H-1B visa holders to fill specialized faculty, research and staff roles.
Oregon State University currently sponsors more than 150 individuals with H-1B visas,and there are 50 H-1B visa holders currently working at the University of Oregon.","Oregon is suing the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee on a popular legal pathway employers use to hire highly skilled, foreign workers. That’s roughly 13 to 100 times the current fees for the specialized work visas.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and a coalition of 18 other Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Massachusetts, alleging the Trump administration’s new H-1B visa fee, announced in September, exceeds what is authorized by Congress. They argue it contradicts Congress’s intent when it established the program, bypasses required rulemaking procedures and exceeds the authority granted to the executive branch. The new fee does not apply to existing H-1B visa holders, only to new recipients.

H-1B visas allow U.S. employers to petition the federal government for permission to hire highly skilled foreign workers for jobs that are hard to fill, require specialized training and at least a bachelor’s degree, such as some medical jobs, technology jobs and university research positions. Congress currently limits the number of H-1B visas available to bachelor’s degree-holders each year to 65,000, and makes available 20,000 visas for applicants holding a master’s degree or higher.

In ordering the new fee, the Trump administration alleged the program was being abused to allow companies to hire foreign workers who would accept lower wages, was displacing workers born in the U.S. and discouraging Americans from pursuing skills and credentials to fill jobs currently filled by H-1B visa holders.

Public universities in Oregon are dependent on H-1B visa holders to fill specialized faculty, research and staff roles. Oregon State University currently sponsors more than 150 individuals with H-1B visas,and there are 50 H-1B visa holders currently working at the University of Oregon.

“Oregon’s colleges, universities and research institutions rely on skilled international workers to keep labs running, courses on track and innovation moving forward,” Rayfield said in a statement. “This enormous fee would make it nearly impossible for these institutions to hire the experts they need, and it goes far beyond what Congress ever intended. This threatens Oregon’s ability to compete, educate and grow.”

Employers filing an initial H-1B petition would usually expect to pay between $960 to $7,595 in regulatory and statutory fees, but the Trump administration’s new $100,000 fee exceeds the actual cost that it takes to process the visa, according to the Oregon Department of Justice.

There hasn’t been major immigration reform since 1986, when then President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act into law.
Last year, Congress attempted to pass a bipartisan border security bill that would have cracked down on illegal immigration.
Pritzker rolled out the red carpet for illegal immigrants,” Chesney said.","As Chicago deals with the aftermath of aggressive immigration enforcement, some advocates say reform is needed now more than ever.

Both Republicans and Democrats say that the system needs change, but for decades, they haven’t agreed on how to fix it.

While some say there aren’t enough legal pathways for people to become citizens, others argue for tougher restrictions to discourage illegal immigration.

There hasn’t been major immigration reform since 1986, when then President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act into law. It legalized millions of undocumented immigrants while also introducing new employment verification requirements, making it illegal for immigrants to work without authorization.

There have been some attempts at policy change in recent years. Last year, Congress attempted to pass a bipartisan border security bill that would have cracked down on illegal immigration. But the effort failed after a Republican filibuster.

President Donald Trump used the lack of policy change to his advantage on the campaign trail. He has blamed Democrats for so-called open-border policies, despite the Biden administration’s efforts to secure the southern border and ban migrants from getting asylum protections if they cross the border illegally.

Trump is making good on his promise to voters to crack down on illegal immigration and deport undocumented people — a move that has drawn sharp criticism from his opponents.

State Sen. Andrew Chesney (R-Freeport) said the current atmosphere around immigration enforcement is the product of years of pushback from Republicans about current policies.

“The clean-up of the Biden administration’s open-border policies has created a little bit of controversy,” Chesney said. “We are a nation of laws, and they need to be enforced. When they are not enforced, you are now asking the new administration to enter into communities and correctly evict those that are in this country illegally.”

The lack of concrete solutions at the federal level has fueled some disagreement locally, despite state laws protecting immigrants. Some Republicans in Springfield like Chesney are pushing to repeal the Illinois TRUST Act, which prevents local law enforcement in the state from collaborating with federal immigration agents.

Chesney said the current laws don’t do enough to reduce illegal immigration and the TRUST Act makes law enforcement harder.

“Gov. Pritzker rolled out the red carpet for illegal immigrants,” Chesney said. “Where we’ve seen the challenges is when it comes to coordination on removing those criminal aliens in our communities.”

Supporters of the TRUST Act say it protects public safety by making sure people feel comfortable calling the police without worrying about being targeted by immigration agents.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is tightening limits on refugees and asylum seekers admitted to the United States. Next year, refugees will be limited to 7,500 — the lowest-ever cap — and will primarily be made up of Afrikaners, or White South Africans descended from Dutch colonizers.

Matthew Soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy at World Relief, said applying for refugee or asylum status can be a lengthy, yearslong court process, which helps neither case workers nor migrants. He said he’s pushing for policy changes that would help asylum seekers determine whether they have a strong case and whether it’s worth making the journey to the U.S.

“The number of immigration judges and the number of asylum officers is so inadequate to the number of people making claims to asylum,” Soerens said. “I would say the solution to that is not to just give up on asylum, which is largely what the Trump administration has done.”

Soerens suggested lawmakers revisit past proposals that would allow immigrants who have overstayed their visas or entered the country illegally to pay a fine to be eligible for amnesty. He said reform should focus on making it easier to immigrate legally while addressing border security.

“Congress has sort of abdicated their responsibility to reform a system that has not been functioning well for a very long time,” Soerens said. “We’ve seen Republican presidents like George W. Bush and Democratic presidents like Barack Obama try to resolve that with actually very similar policy proposals. How you solve this is not a huge, confusing question.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-15 23:57:36.726674

""Rather than creating jobs for U.S.-born workers as proponents claim,"" he added, ""mass deportations eliminate employment opportunities for citizens and immigrants alike.""
Recent research indicates that Trump's mass deportations are harming local economies across the US.
Zipperer wrote Monday that the direct care sector is ""highly vulnerable to these enforcement actions,"" as it ""relies heavily on immigrant labor.""
""If the direct care workforce contracts by nearly 400,000 workers due to deportations, millions of older adults and people with disabilities will be left without the professional assistance they need to remain safely in their homes.""","An analysis released Monday provides a more focused look at the economic impacts of US President Donald Trump's lawless mass deportation agenda, estimating that his administration's policies could kill nearly 400,000 jobs in the direct care industry, which employs home health aides, nursing assistants, and others.

The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) analysis shows that if the Trump administration achieves its stated goal of deporting one million people per year over the next four years, ""the direct care industry would lose close to 400,000 jobs—affecting 274,000 immigrant and 120,000 US-born workers.""

""This dramatic reduction in trained care workers would compromise home-based care services, forcing family members to scramble for informal arrangements to support relatives who are older or have disabilities,"" wrote EPI's Ben Zipperer, the author of the new analysis.

The estimate builds on earlier EPI research warning that Trump's deportation policies could destroy nearly 6 million total jobs in the US, an economic impact that comes in addition to the pain and human rights abuses inflicted on families across the country.

So far, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the administration is on pace for fewer than 700,000 deportations by the end of 2025—well short of its goal.

But it's not for lack of trying: In recent months, masked agents have been rampaging through American cities and detaining people en masse, often targeting job sites. Immigration agents have reportedly been instructed to prioritize ""quantity over quality,"" leading to the detention of mostly people with no criminal convictions.

""Rather than creating jobs for U.S.-born workers as proponents claim,"" he added, ""mass deportations eliminate employment opportunities for citizens and immigrants alike.""

Recent research indicates that Trump's mass deportations are harming local economies across the US. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted in August that ""the early warning signs show a growing labor shortage, rising prices, terrified employees, and employers left in the lurch without any tools to ensure workforce stability.""

""Should these operations continue unabated over the next three and a half years,"" he continued, ""the situation could become far worse for the nation as a whole.""

Zipperer wrote Monday that the direct care sector is ""highly vulnerable to these enforcement actions,"" as it ""relies heavily on immigrant labor.""

""The Trump administration’s deportation agenda threatens to trigger a cascading crisis in senior and disability care that will harm families across the economic spectrum,"" Zipperer warned.

""Why does a US citizen need to carry immigration documents?""","Federal law enforcement agencies are detaining US citizens who do not carry proof of their citizenship in what civil rights advocates describe as a flagrant violation of constitutional rights—and a top Trump administration official is claiming the government has the authority to do so.

A Somali-born Minnesota man was alarmed by the practice last Tuesday when immigration agents tackled him, handcuffed him, and arrested him, refusing to accept his REAL ID as proof of his legal residence in a video that was widely circulated on social media.

The man, who identified only as Mubashir, was placed into a chokehold and forced to his knees in the snow on his way to get food in Minneapolis' Cedar-Riverside neighborhood, which has a large Somali population.

As the Sahan Journal describes:

Mubashir said he told officers multiple times that he is a US citizen and asked if he could show them his ID. Officers ignored him, dragged him in the snow, and pushed him into a car as witnesses yelled and blew whistles, according to the video of his arrest.

The arrest occurred as federal agents walked into nearby businesses in the Somali-heavy neighborhood, questioning people and asking them to show their passports. Mubashir said he was in the car with officers for about 20 minutes, asking them repeatedly if he could show them his ID. They refused, he said.

According to the report, officers asked if they could photograph Mubashir to check whether he's a US citizen—likely to run his information through a facial recognition application that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has acknowledged it uses during immigration stops, including on US citizens without their consent.

Mubashir declined to have his photo taken, asking: ""How would a picture prove I’m a US citizen?”

He was later taken to a federal building that houses an immigration court and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices. Only after having his fingerprint taken was Mubashir allowed to present his ID and given permission to leave.

Officers refused to drop him back off at Cedar-Riverside, instead telling him to walk home more than seven miles in the midst of a snowstorm, which had led authorities to issue a weather advisory.

“I deserve to be here like anyone else—I’m a US citizen,” Mubashir said. “I can’t even step outside without being tackled—no question—because I’m Somali.”

""I apologize that this happened to you in my city, with people wearing vests that say 'police.' That's embarrassing,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said to Mubashir during a press conference on Wednesday.

According to legal experts, there is no requirement under US law that American citizens must be prepared to prove their citizenship at a moment's notice.

In comments to KQED, a public radio station in San Francisco, earlier this month, Richard Boswell, a law professor at the University of California Law School, called it “most troubling” that US citizens have felt the need to carry their ID to avoid harassment.

“There is no reason why government officers can or should be questioning people about their citizenship without any reason to suspect that they are noncitizens who are here unlawfully,” he explained.

Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), noncitizens must carry proof of their legal status, such as a green card or a foreign passport with stamps indicating a lawful visa.

About two dozen states require residents to identify themselves if stopped by law enforcement. But none require citizens to carry a physical ID at all times, except in specific cases, such as operating a motorized vehicle.

And, as Bree Bernwanger, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Northern California, explained, “there is no legal requirement that US citizens carry papers or have proof of their citizenship on them."" Unless police have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the US unlawfully, she said, ""there shouldn’t be a reason to have to carry your papers, because immigration agents aren’t supposed to stop people or detain them.""

But as backlash rolled in from the video of Mubashir's arrest, the man leading Trump's mass deportation crusade, US Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino, seemed to falsely suggest via social media that citizens are required to carry proof of their citizenship.

""One must carry immigration documents as per the INA. A REAL ID is not an immigration document,"" he wrote in response to a post about Mubashir's arrest, which noted his citizenship.

Jeremy Konyndyk, the president of Refugees International, responded that ""in no way does the INA require citizens to carry immigration documents"" and that Bovino is ""just letting his jackboot thugs presumptively detain whomever they like.""

Immigration lawyer Jared McClain later noted on social media that, in response to a class-action suit arguing against indiscriminate workplace raids, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) argued that an Alabama construction worker, who was kept in handcuffs even after presenting multiple REAL IDs to agents, had still not done enough to prove his citizenship, according to the federal officers.

""This is the official policy—not a one-off,"" McClain said.

Aaron Reichlin Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, said the filing was ""official confirmation that ICE HSI believes that it can, in fact, detain US citizens for immigration checks, and keep them handcuffed while they have their biometrics run.""

""That is a chilling assertion,"" he said.

ProPublica found in October that at least 170 Americans have been detained by immigration agents, sometimes for days, with some having been ""dragged, tackled, beaten, tased, and shot.""

But months after the report was published, top administration officials—including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem—continue to emphatically deny that any US citizens have been detained during the second Trump administration.

At a House Homeland Security Committee hearing on Thursday, Noem abruptly left before Democrats could grill her on reports that citizens had been arrested, claiming she had to speak at a different committee hearing. Reports later found that the hearing had already been cancelled, leading to accusations that Noem misled Congress.

In response to Bovino's assertion that REAL IDs are not immigration documents, Nicole Foy, a reporter at ProPublica, told the Border Patrol commander: ""We've been trying to request an interview with you for months now about the enforcement operations you're leading and the detention of US citizens.""

""Why does a US citizen need to carry immigration documents?"" she asked. At press time, Bovino had not publicly responded to Foy's question.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62503989&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C414%2C0%2C414,N,,2025-12-15 21:57:25.157080

Brown is a color that is vilified by our current white supremacist president and administration. An administration that funds and commits terrible acts on the American people based on the color of their skin. Every day, I read a new horror committed at the hands of ICE officers reveling in their cruelty.

Families torn apart. Innocent immigrants deported to an El Salvador prison. Detention centers with inhumane conditions. Community members being disappeared. Fathers taken with young children are abandoned on the side of a road in a pickup. Leaders being pepper-sprayed in the face for asking questions.

Last night, I read about ICE officers running over the legs of a Hispanic detainee and not calling an ambulance for medical care. This happened a block away from where I taught for five years. It has taken less than a year for me to feel enraged but not surprised at this incident.

I love my stepson with Filipino heritage and preemie twin grandsons. As I visited them at the children’s hospital for two months, ICE sat waiting outside. I thanked the hospital security every visit for keeping loved ones safe. As I prayed over my 2 1/2 pound grandson who came into the world too early and small. I worried that my stepson and grandsons might get mistakenly picked up in the violent, racist acts committed by ICE agents.

Every trip to the grocery store, coffee shop, laundromat, hospital, and horse stables is choreographed around ICE agent reports. ICE is the true terror in our communities, not immigrants. A terror that was orchestrated by our racist president and administration to overfund an army of undertrained ICE agents running roughshod with black masks over their faces, carrying out their racist Hitler fantasies, with no legal repercussions to curb their abusive actions.

America is a melting pot, and our diversity makes us great. It is time to call out the hate, racism, and violence for what it is. I stand with my family and the communities of color. I’m ready to create a new future filled with equality and opportunities for everyone. I love brown people. Do you?

An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.

Every day, hopeful migrants traverse the harsh deserts and treacherous mountain regions of the southern United States in search of safety, shelter, and opportunity. While these dangerous journeys are often reported in the news, the struggles of women and girls — who are vulnerable to violence and exploitation — are frequently overlooked.

Since his first presidential term, Donald Trump’s policies have directly targeted migrant communities and women’s health. Now, during his second term, the growing impacts of climate change and global conflicts have made the already dangerous journeys of migrants even more urgent and fatal.

The policy impact

Trump and his supporters often use inflammatory rhetoric to characterize migrants as criminals, gang members, or even sexual predators, thereby galvanizing public support for increasingly punitive border policies. Such labels also dehumanize migrants, instill fear, and justify aggressive enforcement measures or rollbacks of migrant protections.

The president has repeatedly insulted women — including journalists and his 2024 Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris — and his administration has passed policies threatening women’s health and reproductive rights. The intersection of these narratives disproportionately affects migrant women, many of whom lack legal protections in the U.S., making them especially vulnerable to discriminatory practices.

Despite promises to focus on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal convictions, U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) data illustrates the reality: people who have contributed to American society and the economy are being targeted, detained, and deported illegally. Of the 435,000 unauthorised immigrants with criminal convictions identified by ICE, less than 3,000 had been arrested as of May 2025.

Testimonials of those who have been detained and deported without trial depict ICE's severe human rights violations. Many people, having been arrested by plain clothes ICE officials who kept their faces covered, and were without proper warrants, report feeling as though they had been kidnapped. Detainees were refused proper trials, and were subsequently sent to countries they barely know, or have never lived in.

Suspension of asylum and refugee programs

Seeking asylum in the U.S. has been legal since 1980. Under both international and U.S. law, migrants fleeing violence and persecution are entitled to request entry. By suspending both the asylum and refugee admissions programs, the Trump administration has effectively shut down two of the few legal pathways to U.S. residency and citizenship.

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in 2024, under the Biden-Harris administration, “female refugees had a higher median age.” Admissions rose each year from 2022 to 2024, reaching 100,060 refugees — the highest number in 30 years — figures that underscore the global need for humanitarian protection.

The shutdown of CBP One

CBP One is a U.S. government app that allows migrants to schedule appointments with immigration officials. Just hours after returning to office, Trump ordered the app’s shutdown as part of his larger strategy to restrict regular migration. At the time, tens of thousands of migrants with scheduled appointments were notified that their court appearances had been canceled. In the past, CBP One had enabled nearly a million people to legally enter the U.S. and apply for work eligibility. Its closure abruptly removed another vital legal pathway for thousands of families.

Before the shutdown, approximately 280,000 people attempted to access the app each day. Many had already spent weeks or months at the U.S.–Mexico border, hoping for an appointment slot to open — prolonged waits that came after long, hazardous journeys, often involving significant health risks.

With the app no longer functional, migrants have been left with few options: remain at the border without shelter or protection, seek precarious refuge in unfamiliar areas of Mexico, or return to the countries from which they fled, where the dangers that prompted their exodus persist. All of these choices carry serious risks, particularly for women and children, who are especially vulnerable to theft, exploitation, and violence in the absence of safe housing or support.

The “Remain in Mexico” policy

Formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), the “Remain in Mexico” program was first introduced in 2019 under the Trump-Pence administration. It forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their court hearings, often for months or even years.

The Biden-Harris administration ended the program, citing widespread human rights abuses; Trump has now reinstated it, leading to renewed concerns over human rights violations.

A humanitarian crisis, not a migrant one

The U.S.-Mexico border wall is a physical representation of the division, exclusion, and fear that has been created between different ethnicities and nationalities. Despite the Trump administration’s many attempts to deter migrants, there are multiple factors driving people to seek shelter, livelihood, and safety. Environmental devastation, including droughts, hurricanes, and desertification, is displacing families across the globe.

Though migrants understand both the risks of the journey and the harsh stance of the U.S. government, many still choose to take the risk, because doing nothing often means death, instability, or continued violence. Migrating is often a last resort to create a new life with a more stable future.

The role of mutual aid

Since 2018, Border Kindness has been providing life-saving support along the U.S.-Mexico border. The nonprofit supplies food, water, medical care, legal aid, and clothing, meeting the urgent needs of migrants whom official systems have failed.

“People of color are being stopped for their skin color or their accent, and women are especially vulnerable during these times,” explained Kelly Overton, founder of Border Kindness. “At the same time, funders have stopped supporting organizations like ours that support migrants and immigration reform. They’re afraid of being accused of funding anti-American or illegal activities.”

The organization has recently been relying more on community-led fundraising, mostly artists and small donors. Overton says this type of effort is needed now more than ever: “Mutual aid is simple. You don’t have to have a lot, but you can share what you have. We at Border Kindness facilitate mutual aid by redistributing resources to where they’re needed most. It puts us at risk, but we are honored to do it.”

Redistribution, he attests, “looks like a woman in Chicago, Los Angeles, or Austin helping a woman at the border receive baby formula for her young child. They offer what they have, even if it isn’t much. The importance of mutual aid is continuing to give to the people who need it, and that’s what we’re able to do thanks to those willing to share what they have, no matter how much that is.”

Resistance and solidarity

The fight for migrant justice doesn’t stop at the border. Across the U.S., individuals and organizations like the National Immigration Law Center, Freedom for Migrants, and The Bridge (The Haitian Bridge Alliance), are resisting the Trump administration’s immigration policies, as they continue to educate, and provide direct services.",https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/markus-spiske-ohFpaJuVpK8-unsplash-800x450.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 21:57:28.864490

Monday’s visit was the first for state senators since the former state prison was converted to an ICE detention facility last month.

Sen. Myron Dorn, chair of the Legislature’s oversight committee, was impressed, saying the facility “looked very good, very clean, very well kept. It looked pretty calm, content. The detainees didn't look like they were anxious or anything like that.”

Dorn and the other senators said they did not interact with the detainees, although Sen. Dan Lonowski said the detainees could have done so if they wanted to. Senators described the people being held as sunning themselves, playing in a recreation area, and playing cards.

Sen. Margo Juarez said the facility did not look much different from when she visited it earlier this year, before it was converted from a work ethic camp for prisoners nearing their release date, except for the addition of a taller fence and an electronic gate with a guard.

Juarez said she did not observe bad conditions such as have been reported at an ICE detention facility in Florida.

“Obviously there are positives to it … as far as the environment goes,"" she said. ""But the plan is still wrong to me. I am still not supportive of what they're doing. I am one who's more supportive of getting those immigration laws changed, and quit ignoring the issues, and let's accommodate the workforce needs that exist.""

Sen. Tom Brandt said Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys indicated his department picks up detainees at airports including North Platte and Omaha and delivers them to McCook.

“In a sense, it's just a holding area for these people. They have access to telephones, they have access to laptops. They have two rooms set aside as what they call virtual courtrooms,” Brandt said. He said senators saw one detainee conversing with a judge or an attorney on a screen, with a corrections employee helping with translation and use of the technology.

Sen. Rob Clements said indications are there are at least 100 detainees at the facility, and described a bank of telephones with information on reaching consulates from many different countries, including Rwanda, China, Iran, and Mexico. Juarez said there were many different ethnicities, but most detainees appeared to be Hispanic.

Lonowski described the facility as reminiscent of a military barracks, with people responsible for their own areas, and said overall, he was very impressed.

Juarez said she was told the facility planned to add a negatively pressured room to prevent contagious detainees from spreading disease to others, among other construction planned to help the facility reach a capacity of up to 300 sometime next year.

Key Lime Air is headquartered at Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County.
The airport could stand to lose Federal Aviation Administration grants because of its denial of the lease, which Council member Kevin Flynn cited as his reason for voting in favor of the resolution.

The resolution would have created a lease for 1,200 feet of space at the airport for Key Lime Air, which also operates as Denver Air Connection. The space would include an area to store items like snow removal equipment, employee parking and an office trailer, according to the proposed lease agreement. Without the lease, the company can still use the common area of a cargo apron.

“When we’re talking about the values of our city, and we stand up here and we say time after time that we support our immigrant community and that we are a welcoming city — I cannot support a corporation that does not prescribe to that,” Council member Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez said.

Two of Key Lime’s airplanes have been used for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement flights to shuffle detained immigrants around the country, primarily to ICE’s hubs in Texas and Louisiana, as first reported by Newsline. During the time period analyzed by Newsline, neither of those planes landed in Colorado. There have been 122 outbound immigration enforcement flights out of Denver this year, according to the most recent ICE Flight Monitor report from Human Rights Watch, though there is little information about which airport those flights are leaving from.

Key Lime Air is headquartered at Centennial Airport in Arapahoe County. It has also operated at Denver International Airport since 2006 as a cargo feeder airline, according to George Karayiannakis, the airport’s senior vice president of airline and commercial affairs.

The airport could stand to lose Federal Aviation Administration grants because of its denial of the lease, which Council member Kevin Flynn cited as his reason for voting in favor of the resolution.

“Voting it down means they won’t be paying us. They’ll be using it for free,” he said. “We can’t kick Key (Lime) Air out of the airport, but we can make them pay to use the piece of concrete that they want to use. Voting this down means they use the common use area for free.”

Flynn was the single vote in favor of the resolution.

“This is where the rubber starts to hit the road, when we start to talk about, what are we going to do in Denver, about what’s happening at the federal level,” Council member Sarah Parady said. “I have no interest in supporting this deportation machine. And if an aviation grant is what’s on the line there, it’s very clear to me where the city should stand on that.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dsc_0976-1024x6831765846442.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=T5tDFByu,N,,2025-12-15 21:57:39.187935

The lawsuit alleges the agent unlawfully applied a carotid restraint to Mr. Zapata Rivera while arresting him on Nov. 6, 2025. The Department of Homeland Security’s own policies prohibit agents from using carotid restraint techniques except when deadly force is justified.

Mr. Zapata Rivera was driving his wife to work with their one-year-old daughter when they were pulled over by several ICE agents, who informed Mr. Zapata Rivera’s wife that they intended to arrest her. The lawsuit alleges an unidentified agent — listed in the lawsuit as Agent John Doe — climbed into the vehicle and pressed his thumbs forcefully on Mr. Zapata Rivera’s carotid arteries, restricting blood flow to his brain. Mr. Zapata Rivera lost consciousness, and he experienced involuntary seizure-like movements. The ICE agent continued to apply the carotid restraint with at least one hand while these involuntary movements continued.

“All people in the United States have a constitutional right to be free from excessive force,” said Daniel McFadden, a managing attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts. “Carlos posed no threat to anyone. Yet this lawsuit alleges a federal agent compressed the blood vessels in his neck until he lost consciousness and suffered involuntary, seizure-like movements. The agent’s use of force against Carlos was dangerous, grossly excessive, and unlawful.”

The lawsuit alleges that ICE agents refused to allow Mr. Zapata Rivera to be evaluated by emergency medical personnel at the scene. After his release, he continued to suffer severe physical symptoms and went to the emergency room for treatment. The Department of Homeland Security’s public statements about the incident falsely accused Mr. Zapata Rivera of faking a seizure and refusing medical care.

An immigrant from Ecuador, Mr. Zapata Rivera applied for asylum in early 2024 and has been authorized to work in the United States while that application is pending. After his counsel sent a letter to ICE requesting that the agency preserve evidence relating to this incident, ICE abruptly sent Mr. Zapata Rivera a “Call-In Letter” demanding that he appear with his passport at ICE’s Burlington office at 10 a.m. on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. It was the first time he had received such a request since early 2023.

“Carlos has faithfully followed every step of the legal process to seek permanent status in the United States,” said Annelise Araujo, founding partner of Annelise Araujo Law and Carlos’ immigration attorney. “In response, ICE has repeatedly misused its authority — first by employing excessive force against him, and now by using the levers of agency power to retaliate against Carlos for his decision to hold ICE to account for its actions.”

Perez Batres is charged with illegal reentry by a previously deported alien.

Kelly O. Hayes, U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland, announced the indictment with Acting Special Agent in Charge Evan Campanella, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) – Maryland.

According to the indictment, Perez Batres, who resided in Beltsville, Maryland, unlawfully reentered the United States after he was removed on three separate occasions – in January 1996, September 2009, and May 2010. He did not received consent from the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security to reapply for admission to the United States, as required by law.

An indictment is not a finding of guilt. Individuals charged by indictment are presumed innocent until proven guilty at a later criminal proceeding.

If convicted, Perez Batres faces up to two years in federal prison. A federal district court judge determines sentencing after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

The investigation and indictment were coordinated and prosecuted by Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA), the Department’s lead effort in combating high-impact human smuggling and trafficking committed by cartels and Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs). JTFA also leads and supports U.S. Attorneys’ Offices in the prosecution of crimes related to unaccompanied alien children (UACs). A highly successful partnership between the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), JTFA investigates and prosecutes human smuggling and trafficking and related immigration crimes that impact public safety and border security. JTFA’s mission is to target the leaders and organizers of Cartels and TCOs involved in human smuggling and trafficking throughout the Americas. The Attorney General has elevated and expanded JTFA to target the most prolific and dangerous human smuggling and trafficking groups operating not only in Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, but also in Canada, the Caribbean and the maritime border, and elsewhere. Led by the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of International Affairs, and the Office of Enforcement Operations, among others, JTFA has dedicated Assistant United States Attorney-detailees from the Southern District of California; District of Arizona; District of New Mexico; Western and Southern Districts of Texas; Southern District of Florida; Northern District of New York; and District of Vermont. JTFA also partners with other USAOs throughout the country and supports high-priority cases in any district. All JTFA cases rely on substantial law enforcement resources from DHS, including ICE/ HSI and CBP/BP and OFO, as well as FBI and other law enforcement agencies. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 425 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling and/or trafficking; more than 375 U.S. convictions; more than 325 significant jail sentences imposed, and forfeitures of substantial assets.

Additionally, this prosecution is part of the Homeland Security Task Force (HSTF) initiative established by Executive Order 14159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion. The HSTF is a whole-of-government partnership dedicated to eliminating criminal cartels, foreign gangs, transnational criminal organizations, and human smuggling and trafficking rings operating in the United States and abroad. Through historic interagency collaboration, the HSTF directs the full might of United States law enforcement towards identifying, investigating, and prosecuting the full spectrum of crimes committed by these organizations, which have long fueled violence and instability within our borders. In performing this work, the HSTF places special emphasis on investigating and prosecuting those engaged in child trafficking or other crimes involving children. The HSTF further utilizes all available tools to prosecute and remove the most violent criminal aliens from the United States. HSTF Baltimore comprises agents and officers from various federal, state, and local agencies with the prosecution being led by the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland.

This case is also part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime.

U.S. Attorney Hayes commended HSI for its work in the investigation. Ms. Hayes also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorney LaShanta Harris, and Trial Attorneys Matthew Thiman and Sean F. Mulryne of the Justice Department’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section, who are prosecuting the case.

“After he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [ICE] agents,” Omar said of her son in an interview with WCCO on Sunday.
“I hope he gets the help he needs.” Last Friday — days before ICE stopped her son — Omar sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, accusing agents of “blatant racial profiling” and egregious force in the Twin Cities.
In her interview with WCCO, Omar spoke about another incident involving her son, who was recently praying at a mosque when ICE entered.

Minnesota — where Omar serves as Democratic congresswoman — has the largest Somali population in the country, and over 78 percent of that population lives in the Twin Cities. At a cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump targeted Omar and disparaged Somalis in a racist outburst, calling them “garbage” he doesn’t want in the United States. “These are people that do nothing but complain. When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it,” he spewed toward the end of the meeting, after appearing to stave off sleep. “His obsession with me is creepy,” Omar wrote on X afterward. “I hope he gets the help he needs.”

Last Friday — days before ICE stopped her son — Omar sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, accusing agents of “blatant racial profiling” and egregious force in the Twin Cities. “It is clear to me that this surge came in direct response to Trump’s racist comments about Somali people, and about me in particular,” Omar wrote, per CBS.

In her interview with WCCO, Omar spoke about another incident involving her son, who was recently praying at a mosque when ICE entered. Though the agents left without incident, Omar told the outlet her son “always carries” his passport with him. Later, Omar said she had to remind him “how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in, and they are racially profiling — they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.”

“For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” California Atty.
For now, the fate of 300 federalized California soldiers remains in limbo, though troops are currently barred by court orders from deployment in California and Oregon.","Dozens of California National Guard troops under President Trump’s command apparently slipped out of Los Angeles under cover of darkness early Sunday morning, ahead of an appellate court’s order to be gone by noon Monday.

Administration officials would not immediately confirm whether the troops had decamped. But video taken outside the Roybal Federal Building downtown just after midnight on Sunday and reviewed by The Times shows a large tactical truck and four white passenger vans leaving the facility, which has been patrolled by armed soldiers since June.

About 300 California troops remain under federal control, some 100 of whom were still active in Los Angeles as of last week, court records show.

“There were more than usual, and all of them left — there was not a single one that stayed,” said protester Rosa Martinez, who has demonstrated outside the federal building for months and was there Sunday.

Troops were spotted briefly later that day, but had not been seen again as of Monday afternoon, Martinez said.

The development that forced the troops to leave was part of a sprawling legal fight for control of federalized soldiers nationwide that remains ongoing.

The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued the order late Friday but softened an even more stringent edict from a lower court judge last week that would have forced the president to relinquish command of the state’s forces. Trump federalized thousands of California National Guard troops in June troops to quell unrest over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

“For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said in a statement. “While this decision is not final, it is a gratifying and hard-fought step in the right direction.”

The ruling Friday came from the same three-judge panel that handed the president one of his most sweeping second-term victories this summer, after it found that the California deployment could go forward under an obscure and virtually untested subsection of the law.

That precedent set a “great level of deference” as the standard of review for deployments that have since mushroomed across the country, circumscribing debate even in courts where it is not legally binding.

But the so-called Newsom standard — California Gov. Gavin Newsom was the lead plaintiff on the lawsuit — has drawn intense scrutiny and increasingly public rebuke in recent weeks, even as the Trump administration argues it affords the administration new and greater powers.

In October, the 7th Circuit — the appellate court that covers Illinois — found the president’s claims had “insufficient evidence,” upholding a block on a troop deployment in and around Chicago.

“Even applying great deference to the administration’s view of the facts ... there is insufficient evidence that protest activity in Illinois has significantly impeded the ability of federal officers to execute federal immigration laws,” the panel wrote.

That ruling is now under review at the Supreme Court.

In November, the 9th Circuit vacated its earlier decision allowing Trump’s Oregon federalization to go forward amid claims the Justice Department misrepresented important facts in its filings. That case is under review by a larger panel of the appellate division, with a decision expected early next year.

Despite mounting pressure, Justice Department lawyers have doubled down on their claims of near-total power, arguing that federalized troops remain under the president’s command in perpetuity, and that courts have no role in reviewing their deployment.

When Judge Mark J. Bennett asked the Department of Justice whether federalized troops could “stay called up forever” under the government’s reading of the statute at a hearing in October, the answer was an unequivocal yes.

“There’s not a word in the statute that talks about how long they can remain in federal service,” Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Eric McArthur said.

In October and November alone, 217 ICE flights departed from the airfield in Bedford, according to ICE Flight Monitor.
Many of the individuals on board were detained at Plymouth County’s ICE detention facility, which is the only such county facility in Massachusetts.
This practice must stop.” ICE and DHS have previously declined to tell GBH News how many people have been transferred out of Massachusetts via particular airports, and how their contracts to do so work.
“‘ICE flights’ refer to charter flights operated by fixed based operators at Hanscom,” said Jennifer Mehigan, spokesperson for Massport.","Massachusetts’ governor is calling for federal immigration authorities to stop using a Bedford airport for private deportation and transfer flights.

Gov. Maura Healey wrote in a Friday letter she had become aware U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as part of its “disturbing and anti-American deportation tactics,” is using “private aircrafts at Hanscom Field airport in Massachusetts to quickly remove residents and sever them from their family, friends, and counsel without due process of law.”

Healey, a Democrat, called on ICE to stop using private aircraft at Hanscom Field airport in Bedford to transfer detained immigrants. She cited recent data in the New York Times showing that the majority of those detained in Massachusetts have no criminal charges or convictions.

In October and November alone, 217 ICE flights departed from the airfield in Bedford, according to ICE Flight Monitor. The tool, hosted on Human Rights First’s website, is a data-driven initiative that documents U.S. Immigration enforcement flights and was launched by Tom Cartwright, a national immigration advocate who has independently tracked and documented such flights for years.

GBH News first reported the airport was being used to transfer immigrants to border states in overnight flights back in February.

That flight, for instance, was chartered by ICE to transport 40 detainees to New Mexico. The flight was provided by a private charter company, Eastern Air Express, which contracts with the immigration enforcement agency.

Many of the individuals on board were detained at Plymouth County’s ICE detention facility, which is the only such county facility in Massachusetts. The facility is contracted with ICE through 2028 to house immigrant detainees.

Detainees from Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island have also been flown from Hanscom Field.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey wrote in the letter to Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons and Department of Homeland Security director Kristi Noem. “This is not the justice we believe in or stand for in Massachusetts or as Americans. This practice must stop.”

ICE and DHS have previously declined to tell GBH News how many people have been transferred out of Massachusetts via particular airports, and how their contracts to do so work.

“Due to operational security, ICE does not confirm airport facilities used during removal operations of illegal aliens,” a DHS spokesperson told GBH News via email last week.

Over the year, advocates and families of detained individuals have expressed that the transfers violate due process due to their sending people thousands of miles away from attorneys and family.

Healey demanded the agency stop using “any” airports and private jets to deport residents and “obstruct due process.”

A spokesperson for Massport, which runs the Bedford airport, says the quasi-public agency does not have a contract with ICE but it has no authority to halt the flights.

“‘ICE flights’ refer to charter flights operated by fixed based operators at Hanscom,” said Jennifer Mehigan, spokesperson for Massport. She said Massport doesn’t receive prior knowledge about the flights or have a role in their operation.

“Massport cannot discriminate who can or cannot use the airport,” she said. “Public use airports like Hanscom are required to accommodate all flights to the airport, including those by or on behalf of the federal government.”

For example, it prevents state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request.
Dhalac said local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement erodes public trust, making everyone less safe.
“LD 1971 draws a clear line between the role of Maine’s state and local police and the Trump administration’s political immigration enforcement agenda,” ILAP’s executive director Sue Roche said in a statement Monday.","Gov. Janet Mills will allow legislation restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement to become law.

Mills also formally repealed a 2011 executive order issued by former Republican Gov. Paul LePage that had called for enhanced cooperation between state and federal officials on immigration enforcement.

Announcing these decisions in an op-ed published in the Portland Press Herald on Monday afternoon, Mills wrote, “Maine is making clear what we believe: that the federal government should overhaul a failed immigration system that is trapping law-abiding people in the shadows, that it should target criminals who actually pose a danger to public safety, not schoolchildren and their parents, and that no one will make us abandon our neighbors based on the color of their skin or the country they once, if ever, called home.”

The legislation, LD 1971, places restrictions on enforcement activities absent formal agreements with federal authorities, which is currently the case for all Maine law enforcement agencies.

Local police are not required to and generally do not have the authority to enforce immigration laws, but the Trump administration revived a program called 287(g), which deputizes local police officers to detain immigrants. Maine currently has no such agreements after the Wells Police Department — the only local agency that had entered into such a contract — canceled its agreement this fall following public opposition.

LD 1971 passed both chambers last spring — by just one vote in the House of Representatives and seven in the Senate — following substantial changes.

After some members of law enforcement raised concern about the proposal hindering federal partnerships that sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement task forces, the bill was amended so that only work done by local police for the primary purpose of immigration enforcement would be banned. For example, it prevents state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request.

But Mills postponed deciding on the matter, leaving her with the option to either veto the bill or allow it to become law without her signature when lawmakers reconvene in January.

Mills’ pledge on Monday to allow it to become law does not come without hesitation. The former district attorney and attorney general wrote that she is concerned about the restraints in the bill being confusing but that she agrees with its aim of ensuring that Maine law enforcement is enforcing state laws, not federal immigration law.

“LD 1971 is imperfect, and we should not need it,” Mills wrote, “but the times call for it.”

In her reasoning for overturning LePage’s executive order, Mills similarly emphasized that her decision was rooted in concerns about responding to the current moment.

“Under any other president, this may be acceptable,” Mills wrote of cooperation between local and federal officials on immigration enforcement, “but under this Trump administration, it has become a broad and dangerous promise that Maine will not make.”

Meanwhile, the sponsor of LD 1971, Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland), criticized Mills for delaying her decision. The bill won’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns, which is currently slated for April 15.

“When the Legislature enacted this bill last June, we made it clear that defining the boundaries between state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities was critical to safeguarding our communities,” Dhalac wrote in a statement.

Dhalac said local police involvement in federal immigration enforcement erodes public trust, making everyone less safe. Maine House Republicans condemned the governor’s decision, writing in a statement that allowing the bill to become law “shows a reckless disregard for public safety” and “weakens efforts to prevent violent crime.”

During floor discussions, Republicans also argued it would make Maine a target in light of Trump conducting immigration raids in so-called sanctuary jurisdictions and threatening to withhold federal funding, with a few quoting Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins regarding the latter point.

In a statement shared with Maine Morning Star at the time, Collins’ press secretary Blake Kernan said, “Senator Collins’s office does not have a position on state legislation. But, in conversations with legislators, our staff discussed the potential federal funding for state and local law enforcement that this legislation would put at risk.”

Immigrant rights groups such as the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine have heard from clients fearful of contacting law enforcement for emergency services because of the possibility they will loop in federal immigration authorities.

“LD 1971 draws a clear line between the role of Maine’s state and local police and the Trump administration’s political immigration enforcement agenda,” ILAP’s executive director Sue Roche said in a statement Monday. “It ensures that Maine’s resources aren’t being diverted to further terrorize individuals and families, rip workers out of their jobs, destroy public trust, and create chaos and fear.”

​​Michael Kebede, policy director for the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement that the bill will ensure Maine towns aren’t “complicit in or liable for federal abuses of power.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Mills-SOTS-2048x1364.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 17:56:40.356071

This watch list appears to be the next disturbing step, with the government treating adversarial legal representation as suspect conduct.
The existence of the list suggests a bureaucratic culture that views immigration lawyers not as officers of the court, but as obstacles to be monitored.","Did you have immigration lawyer watch list on your 2025 authoritarianism BINGO card? If so, congrats! But for everyone else, it’s yet another sad slide into federal control to learn that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) posted what appears to be a covert roster of immigration attorneys buried on its own website.

The list was discovered by attorney Arlene Amarante, who stumbled upon the list while interacting with ICE’s website and found her own name on it. The list has since been pulled from the website, which is usually what agencies do when a documents is totally normal. Now Al Otro Lado, an immigration advocacy group, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding to know who created the list, why it existed, and what ICE thought it was doing cataloging attorneys in the first place.

Amarante noticed something else about the list that raised even more concerns, as she told WGNO, “One of the troubling patterns I suppose that I recognized, was that a large number of these practitioners on the list were people of color.”

Which pushes this from bureaucratic weirdness into civil liberties nightmare fuel.

Amarante continued:

“Why does the list exist? Whether it’s an innocent incursion or something that is more intentional or nefarious, we need to get to the bottom of it. It’s troubling because there’s a pattern of threats by the administration — the implication by the government is that offering support to a client is the harm in itself and the names on the list sort of seems to support that.”

Let’s not forget, this administration has not been subtle about its hostility toward lawyers in general and immigration lawyers in particular. In March 2025, the White House issued a memo titled “Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court,” which attacked the act of lawyering, accused immigration attorneys of “unscrupulous” conduct, and directed the Attorney General to take action against lawyers and firms that cross the Trump Administration.

Al Otro Lado didn’t mince words, alleging that the database raises “grave concerns of political targeting and professional intimidation at a time when the administration is openly escalating its attacks on immigrant advocates.”

Andrew Fels, a staff attorney at Al Otro Lado, put it bluntly, “There is no obvious legitimate reason for ICE to be compiling what appears to be a covert roster of immigration lawyers. We are giving ICE an opportunity to publicly explain the watch list’s purpose. Publishing the underlying policies governing the watch list’s creation and inclusion criteria will conclusively resolve this issue.”

Cassandra Lopez, Al Otro Lado’s legal director, framed the situation as a warning to all lawyers. “History may be repeating itself. Once again, our staff and colleagues appear on a government watch list simply for doing our jobs—defending the constitutional right to seek asylum and holding the government accountable in court. The pattern is unmistakable and deeply alarming.”

Lopez’s warning is particularly poignant. Since the start of his second term, Donald Trump has been aggressively attacking lawyers and the very rule of law. This watch list appears to be the next disturbing step, with the government treating adversarial legal representation as suspect conduct. That is a direct inversion of how the legal system is supposed to function.

The existence of the list suggests a bureaucratic culture that views immigration lawyers not as officers of the court, but as obstacles to be monitored. And it should concern anyone who still believes the rule of law depends on lawyers being able to do their jobs without being cataloged (or worse) by the very agencies they’re tasked with challenging.",https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/iStock_000024610296Medium-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:57:34.094767

The Trump administration has loosened restrictions on immigration enforcement operations at local courthouses as part of a push to deport millions of migrants living illegally in the U.S.","MILWAUKEE — A federal prosecutor told a jury on Monday that a Wisconsin judge “crossed the line” when she allegedly helped a migrant appearing in her courtroom evade an immigration arrest, kicking off a trial that will test President Donald Trump’s efforts to punish alleged obstructions of his mass deportation efforts.

A lawyer defending Hannah Dugan, an elected judge on the Milwaukee County Circuit Court, countered that the judge was following policy as Immigration and Customs Enforcement escalated operations in courthouses early in Trump’s second term.

Dugan faces federal charges accusing her of concealing a person from arrest and obstructing federal proceedings. Dugan has pleaded not guilty to the charges, brought by Trump’s Justice Department.

“I’ll get the heat”

Prosecutor Keith Alexander said Dugan was allowed to have strong views about the Trump administration’s immigration policy, but not to attempt to thwart federal agents.

“Those strongly held views motivated her to make a decision to cross the line,” Alexander told the jury during his opening statement. He referenced a remark Dugan allegedly made on the day of the April 18 incident: “I’ll get the heat.”

The rare trial of a sitting judge reflects tensions over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics, including positioning federal agents in courthouses to make arrests. The Justice Department has directed prosecutors to investigate activists and officials it accuses of hindering immigration operations.

The case against Dugan stems from an April 18 incident in which a group of agents from ICE and other agencies planned to arrest a migrant from Mexico set to appear in Dugan’s Milwaukee courtroom on domestic violence charges.

Courthouse upheaval

Steven Biskupic, a lawyer for Dugan, told the jury during his opening statement that the Milwaukee courthouse was in a state of upheaval in the weeks before the incident as judges faced ICE agents making arrests in courthouse hallways.

Biskupic said Dugan followed courthouse policies directing staff to alert a supervisor about the presence of ICE agents.

“She sent them to the chief judge’s chambers like she was told to do,” Biskupic said, referring to the agents. “That fact is not going to change.”

The indictment alleges Dugan diverted the agents away from the hallway where law enforcement planned to arrest the man, identified as Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, after the hearing. It also accuses her of escorting Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out of the courtroom through a nonpublic door after privately addressing his case.

Flores-Ruiz walked through a public hallway and was arrested following a brief pursuit outside the courthouse, according to court documents.

Dugan has been suspended from judicial duties by Wisconsin’s top court while the case unfolds.

Trump administration tactic

Prosecutors must show that Dugan acted corruptly to impede Flores-Ruiz’s arrest. In court filings, they cited witnesses describing Dugan becoming “visibly angry” when she learned ICE agents were outside her courtroom and falsely telling law enforcement they needed a judicial warrant to carry out an arrest.

Dugan’s lawyers questioned why agents did not arrest Flores-Ruiz as planned when he appeared in the hallway after leaving the courtroom, suggesting their plans had changed. They pointed to text messages exchanged between agents discussing plans not to immediately arrest Flores-Ruiz and instead to follow him as he walked down the hallway.

The Trump administration has loosened restrictions on immigration enforcement operations at local courthouses as part of a push to deport millions of migrants living illegally in the U.S.

In 2021, Mr. Guan fled to the United States, where he applied for asylum.
“It’s more likely than not for such a highly sensitive person like Mr. Guan that Uganda would send him back to China,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview after the hearing.
In recent days, word of Mr. Guan’s possible deportation set off a furor in the United States.
A source familiar with the case said that Mr. Guan had been arrested during a raid led by the F.B.I.","In 2020, a Chinese citizen had heard reports about China’s mass detention and surveillance of Uyghurs. But he wanted to see if they were true for himself.

So the citizen, Heng Guan, 38, said that he made a hugely risky decision, driving across the country from eastern China to Xinjiang, where he tracked down and secretly shot video of hulking re-education and detention centers mostly holding Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group. The footage later became rare visual evidence of the scale and forcible nature of China’s clampdown, despite Beijing’s claims that they were voluntary re-education camps.

In 2021, Mr. Guan fled to the United States, where he applied for asylum. Then, this August, as he was living in New York, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. His supporters and family members feared he might be sent back to China, where human rights activists say he would almost certainly face retribution from the government.

On Monday, after a public outcry, the Trump administration moved to continue deportation proceedings against Mr. Guan, but argued that he should be sent to Uganda, which has close economic ties to China.

At a virtual immigration hearing on Monday, Niles Gerry, a lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security, cited an agreement that allows asylum seekers in the United States who might face persecution in their home country to be removed to what the government calls safe third countries, where they can apply for asylum. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out mass deportations, have moved swiftly to resume third-country deportations after the Supreme Court cleared the practice in July.

Mr. Guan’s case underscores the immense breadth of Mr. Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which is ensnaring even those who would appear to have obvious claims to asylum.

The Chinese government’s wide-scale repression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang — and the extreme lengths to which officials have gone to distort or stymie any information about its efforts in the region — has been the subject of numerous international media investigations and human rights reports in recent years.

“It’s more likely than not for such a highly sensitive person like Mr. Guan that Uganda would send him back to China,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview after the hearing.

The Persecution of Uyghurs in China

Card 1 of 6

A History of Tension For decades, the Chinese government has treated the Uyghurs, an ethnic group of about 12 million people in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang, as a troublesome population with separatist tendencies.

Who Are the Uyghurs? The Uyghurs are a Central Asian, mostly Muslim, people, who speak their own Turkic language.

Targeting Muslims China used the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S. and Washington’s subsequent declaration of a “global war on terror” as a pretext to intensify its targeting of Uyghur Muslims.

Changing Xinjiang’s Population Chinese leaders sought to increase Xinjiang’s ethnic Han population through settlement programs, and experts estimate that tens of thousands of Uyghurs have been transferred out of the region for work.

International Condemnation The U.N. and the U.S. have condemned China’s abuses, including the use of internment camps and forced sterilization. The State Department called it genocide.

China’s Crackdown Critics of the government’s treatment of Uyghurs as well as their family members have disappeared or been detained, even abroad.

In recent days, word of Mr. Guan’s possible deportation set off a furor in the United States. An editorial in The Wall Street Journal decried his possible deportation, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democratic congressman from Illinois who is a ranking member of a House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, called for Mr. Guan’s release.

At Monday’s hearing, Judge Charles Ouslander scheduled another hearing on Mr. Guan’s removal for Jan. 12, citing among several reasons the heightened interest in the case.

Mr. Chen said that he would file a motion on Mr. Guan’s behalf to allow him to stay in the United States and continue with his asylum application. The Department of Homeland Security said, “More information on this case is forthcoming.”

Mr. Guan was detained in August by immigration officials who had been carrying out an action against his landlord in upstate New York, according to Mr. Chen. A source familiar with the case said that Mr. Guan had been arrested during a raid led by the F.B.I. and Homeland Security Investigations, but that the man had no apparent criminal history.

On Monday, Mr. Guan joined the hearing through a video link wearing an orange jumpsuit from a jail in Binghamton, N.Y., where he is currently being held.

The detention centers in Xinjiang were part of a draconian campaign under the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to indoctrinate Uyghurs and root out what the Communist Party said were dangerous ideas fueling resistance and extremist violence. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and members of other mostly Muslim ethnic groups — some estimates said a million or more — were rounded up and held in re-education centers, detention sites or prisons.

During Mr. Trump’s first presidency, the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghurs emerged as a major source of tension between the two sides. In 2021, on the last full day of Mr. Trump’s first term, the State Department officially declared the Chinese government’s actions in Xinjiang a “genocide.”

And Marco Rubio, then a Republican senator from Florida and now the secretary of state, was among the most outspoken members of Congress on the issue.

Recent reports show that the Chinese government has sent Uyghurs out of Xinjiang to other parts of the country on government work programs that many experts believe are forcible in nature.

The Chinese government, for its part, has rejected any accusations of genocide or human rights violations and has defended its efforts in Xinjiang as necessary to fight against terrorism. Over the years, the government has systematically quashed efforts to question that narrative. It has asserted control through the use of mass surveillance and censorship, heavy policing of the local population as well as intimidation and threats to silence Uyghurs and other critics abroad.

The government has also severely restricted independent media access to the region, which is what made Mr. Guan’s footage — which provided a rare, close-up look at the detention camps detailing their high walls, guard towers and barbed wire — so revelatory.

“It had a big impact for people to see that, wow, this is real stuff happening to people,” said Tahir Imin, a Uyghur activist based in Washington.

Mr. Guan visited Xinjiang as a tourist in 2019, when the detention campaign was at its height, and was shocked by the heavy-handed security he encountered, he told Human Rights in China, a group that is seeking his release from detention.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/15/us/politics/00nat-chinese-deport1/00nat-chinese-deport1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:57:20.269588

Mary Spicuzza

Dugan defense attorney Jason Luczak there was a “frozen water” Signal chat among members of the arrest team at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 as they gathered to arrest an undocumented immigrant.

Luczak asked FBI Special Agent Erin Lucker if they were trying to be funny by calling it the “frozen water” chat, since they were there for a case linked to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE. She noted that she was not part of the chat.

Signal, an encrypted messaging app, has not been approved by the government for classified communications.

Over objections from prosecutors, Luczak asked the agent about other high-profile cases involving federal officials using Signal.

One such case involved Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others, who mistakenly included a magazine editor in a chat about battle plans. The leak sparked fears about the potential mishandling of classified national security information.

Dugan and other Milwaukee County judges were offered training on laws around immigration arrests prior to the April 18 incident in her courtroom, according to an FBI agent's testimony.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Gramling Perez circulated a training in early April from the National Judicial Network's Forum on Human Trafficking and Immigration in State Courts.

Citing emails, FBI agent Erin Lucker testified Gramling Perez told fellow judges she had two takeaways from the training: that ICE can make arrests in public areas of the courthouse, but they not target crime victims or people seeking restraining orders.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Frohling played recordings from the courtroom, including the moment Dugan was told ICE agents were in the hallway.

He also played surveillance footage from the sixth floor courthouse hallway, which showed Dugan in her judge’s robe confronting the agents. At times it also showed Judge Kristela Cervera, who is expected to testify at the trial.

Defense stresses confusion among Milwaukee judges on courthouse arrests

Mary Spicuzza and Hope Karnopp

In his opening statement, Dugan defense attorney Steven Biskupic said there was widespread confusion among Milwaukee County judges as federal officials began making immigration arrests shortly after President Donal Trump returned to office in January.

He said that the courthouse arrests led to “anger, confusion” and even paranoia among judges.

“Does this mean Milwaukee County is cooperating with ICE?” he said. “What kind of warrant was ICE using?”

There were also calls for Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley to set a policy on courthouse arrests, Biskupic said.

He said there was no intent by Dugan to hide the undocumented immigrant involved in the case. It is a judge's job to balance the interests of all parties, not to serve ICE, Biskupic said.

“There’s no concealment,” he said. “There’s no obstruction.”

He stressed that the doorway Flores-Ruiz exited through was close to the public doors of the courtroom — 11 feet and 10 inches away.

""Not even as far as your jury box,” Biskupic said. He added, ""There was a federal agent to the left and to the right.""

A hidden hallway and stairwell just outside Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan's courtroom is taking center stage in the prosecution’s case against the judge.

Dugan is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant try to escape federal officials by telling him to go “down the stairs.”

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel previously wrote about the stairwell and the non-public hallway on the sixth floor of the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Read more here.

Protester says immigration arrests should not take place in courthouses

Vanessa Swales

Michael Pointer Mace, a member of the First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee’s Immigrant Solidarity and Action Committee, said federal immigration agents should not be allowed at sensitive locations, like courthouses, schools and places of worship. The Biden administration previously barred enforcement actions at such locations.

Pointer Mace referenced Illinois, where Gov. JB Pritzker signed a bill banning civil immigration arrests in courthouses. He believes Wisconsin could do the same.

“There are some people who criticize and say it won’t stand up in a court of law. I say let’s find out,” he said.

Dugan ‘not above the law,' prosecutor says

John Diedrich

What Dugan did the day Eduardo Flores-Ruiz appeared before her amounted to creating an escape plan for the undocumented immigrant, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Alexander.

The agents expected Flores-Ruiz to try to get away but they did not expect for Dugan to help him, Alexander said.

“The judicial robe the defendant wore that morning did not put her above the law,” he said.

Audio shows where 'I'll get the heat' came from

Hope Karnopp

In his opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Alexander played audio of Dugan saying the phrase “I’ll get the heat” while speaking to her court reporter, Joan Butz.

Dugan and Butz are whispering on the audio about sending undocumented defendant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out of the courtroom through a hallway and down the stairs. Butz asks Dugan if she should show Flores-Ruiz and his attorney, Mercedes de la Rosa, where to go.

Dugan tells Butz: ""I'll do it. I'll get the heat.""

Alexander acknowledged some of the audio is hard to hear. Jurors are getting a transcript to help them listen, but Alexander said Adelman will remind jurors that the audio is the evidence, not the transcript.

Milwaukee Judge Kristela Cervera likely will be key witness

John Diedrich

In the government’s opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Alexander said that when Dugan heard federal agents were in the hallway to make an arrest, she went to get fellow Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Kristela Cervera off the bench.

According to Alexander, Dugan told Cervera to keep her robe on and went to approach the agents.

Alexander said Cervera’s “heart sank” when she realized they were confronting agents, but felt she couldn’t challenge Dugan because of her demeanor.

Prosecution begins opening statement by quoting Dugan: 'I'll get the heat'

Hope Karnopp and Mary Spicuzza

Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Alexander began his opening statement for the prosecution by quoting Dugan.

“I’ll do it,” he said, repeating what he said were her comments about trying to help an undocumented immigrant escape from federal agents. “I’ll get the heat.”

Alexander said what started as a routine morning became anything but after Dugan was told by her clerk that ICE was in the hallway outside her courtroom.

He also played audio clips from Dugan's courtroom. At one point, Dugan's clerk, Alan Freed, can be heard saying there were ""ICE guys in the hallway.""

There were initially technical issues in playing the audio for the jury. Alexander paused multiple times to apologize and said the audio was working before court began.

Protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee could be heard on the third floor of the courthouse as Dugan’s trial began shortly after 9 a.m. Cars could also be heard honking in support of the demonstration.

Protest organizers have argued that public opinion is on the side of Dugan, who is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade federal agents.

Rally kicks off with speeches

Vanessa Swales and Kelli Arseneau

Some of the groups protesting today are Voces de la Frontera, Working Families Power, the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, the state chapter of Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Wisconsin Justice Initiative, the First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee and the League of Women Voters.

Nick Ramos, executive director of the political watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, spoke to a large crowd outside the courthouse.

“We’re here today because what’s happening inside this courthouse is bigger than one judge, one case or one community,” Ramos said. “We’re here because the rule of law depends on people being able to walk into a courthouse without fear.”

Also among the speakers was Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the nonprofit immigrant rights organization Voces de la Frontera.

""Entire communities live in fear and anxiety, as they are targeted by unlawful arrests, denied bond and are being moved to out of state jails to prevent families and lawyers from providing support,"" Neumann-Ortiz said. ""Naturally, they question whether our legal system will uphold our rights.""

Dugan arrives at courthouse

John Diedrich and Mary Spicuzza

Dugan arrived at the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee at about 8 a.m., an hour before her trial was set to begin.

She entered the courtroom at 8:55 a.m., dressed in black skirt and blazer and cream top. She was accompanied by her security detail.

State lawmakers, protesters rally in 12-degree weather

Vanessa Swales

The cold didn’t stop more than 60 protesters from gathering outside of downtown’s federal courthouse on the first day of Dugan's trial.

Ahead of the trial, Milwaukee resident Joseph Walsh, 79, said he was rallying in favor of civil rights.

“Hannah Dugan’s civil rights are being impinged upon,” he said, arguing that President Donald Trump is trying to “intimidate the judicial [branch] just like they do to lawyers or the universities because they want them to kneel for them.""

State Sen. Chris Larson was one of several Milwaukee area politicians, including Rep. Ryan Clancy, who joined the protest. Larson said he believes the trial will go quickly because Dugan “has domain over her courtroom.”

“I think the whole trial shouldn’t exist at all. This is obviously one of the first political prosecutions of Trump’s Justice Department,” he said.

Dugan trial puts liberal federal judge Lynn Adelman in the spotlight

But don't expect the atmosphere in that courtroom to be stuffy. That's not U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman's style.

Dugan known as a stern judge and advocate for the poor

Sophie Carson, Daniel Bice, Mary Spicuzza and Chris Ramirez

Before April, Dugan was mostly known as a conscientious and stern Milwaukee County judge, highly involved in the progressive community, driven by her belief in the justice system and her Catholic faith.

Then in April, her arrest by FBI agents thrust her the national spotlight, into the center of a clash between President Donald Trump and the judiciary.

It was a startling development for those who know Dugan, who is established in Milwaukee's legal and nonprofit spheres but had not been a prominent, partisan figure. Courthouse colleagues, city politicians and community leaders alike paint an image of a careful judge and a longtime advocate for the poor who takes pains to follow the letter of the law on the bench — to a point that has slowed down the justice system, and resulted in attorneys often requesting a different judge for their case.

Four key questions the Dugan trial could answer

John Diedrich

Many questions remain unanswered heading into the trial Dec. 15. What does Dugan say happened that day? What did Dugan tell Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to do? Who else saw what happened and how did they react? And will judicial immunity become a part of the case?

Reporter John Diedrich dives into the questions that may or may not get answered in the course of the trial. Read more from his analysis here.

5:30 am CT

What are the charges against Judge Hannah Dugan?

John Diedrich

Dugan, 66, was indicted on obstructing a federal agency, which is a felony, and concealing an individual to prevent an arrest, a misdemeanor.

The two charges carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $350,000 fine, but sentences in cases involving nonviolent offenses typically are much shorter.

The complaint and indictment allege Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz elude federal immigration officials at the Milwaukee County Courthouse after he appeared in her courtroom on April 18. Federal agents chased Flores-Ruiz down outside the courthouse and arrested him.

He has since been deported.

“I’m really, really worried that things will be very bad for him if he is made to return,” Guan’s mother, Luo Yun, told AFP in Chinese.
“If he has a chance to remain in the United States, he’ll at least be safe,” she said.
Guan left China after filming the videos, eventually entering the United States following travels through South America.
He’s still young, and has a long life ahead,” said Guan’s mother.","A Chinese man who left his country after filming at sites of alleged human rights violations against Uyghurs now faces the risk of removal from the United States, according to his lawyer and mother.

Guan Heng, 38, underwent an immigration hearing in New York on Monday after being detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August, his mother said in an interview.

The case could see him taken out of the United States and potentially landing back in China eventually.

“I’m really, really worried that things will be very bad for him if he is made to return,” Guan’s mother, Luo Yun, told AFP in Chinese.

“If he has a chance to remain in the United States, he’ll at least be safe,” she said. “I’m incredibly anxious and upset.”

On Monday, the session ended with a next hearing date set for January, said Guan’s lawyer Chen Chuangchuang.

A judge is expected to consider if Guan should instead be sent to Uganda for his asylum application, as it has agreed to accept people deported from the United States.

But Chen vowed to challenge this attempt, arguing that there is a significant chance Guan could be sent back to China from there.

A statement by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission warned on Friday on Twitter/X that Guan “would likely be persecuted” if he returned to China.

“He should be given every opportunity to stay in a place of refuge,” the statement added.

In late 2021, Guan had published a 20-minute video online, detailing his travel around the north-western Xinjiang region in China.

He was visiting places identified by a BuzzFeed investigation as detention facilities for Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities – or likely sites for such centers.

Beijing has been accused of detaining more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017, part of a campaign that the United Nations previously said could constitute “crimes against humanity”.

China vehemently denies these allegations, saying its policies have rooted out extremism in Xinjiang and boosted economic development.

Guan left China after filming the videos, eventually entering the United States following travels through South America.

Around that time, he told his mother he did not plan to return to China.

“As for the contents of the clips that he later posted – I didn’t know about them,” his mother said.

The pair stayed in touch, and she recalls receiving a text in August from a friend of Guan’s, informing her that he had been detained during an operation by ICE.

When she managed to contact him, Luo said, “his emotional state was one of extreme panic and breakdown.”

She added that her family members in mainland China have also been questioned by authorities about their ties to Guan, shortly after he published his video.

“I’m heartbroken,” she said. “I’m not only crying for my child, but the situation that our family is facing.”

Guan’s supporters say he is being held in a Broome County facility in upstate New York. His name appears on an online page of ICE detainees.

“I just want my child to be well. He’s still young, and has a long life ahead,” said Guan’s mother.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c383590b4f0e0f0b158a5bb1b06add90241d3747/322_0_3211_2569/master/3211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3dbdc893071684e98ef042bca7848d7",N,,2025-12-15 15:56:48.109624

In the lower part of Bucks county, in close proximity to Philadelphia, most immigrants are of Latin American descent.
The lower part of Bucks county is also home to thousands of Ukrainians who fled the Russian invasion in 2022.","Only 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Bucks county has gained a reputation as the “swingiest” county in the swing state of Pennsylvania and one of the most pivotal political bellwethers in the country.

Party registration in the county is almost evenly split among Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden won it in 2020, Donald Trump triumphed there in 2024. November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.

In the second Trump administration, incumbent sheriff Frederick Harran, a Republican, had joined many other conservative law enforcement officials across the nation and signed an agreement to work with the federal Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agency.

Those controversial arrangements, known as 287 (g) agreements, allow local and state officials to cooperate on enforcing federal immigration law to varying degrees.

The 287(g) so-called Task Force Model that Harran, 61, signed up to granted his officers the authority to question people they encountered about their immigration status and to carry out immigration-related arrests during traffic stops.

But the ties are set to be short-lived.

Danny Ceisler, a 33-year-old army veteran who worked at the Pentagon and for Pennsylvania Democratic governor Josh Shapiro’s administration, stood against Harran as a Democrat for sheriff. In his campaign, he pledged to terminate the partnership with ICE.

And Ceisler won, not even narrowly. His 23,000 extra votes was an 11% victory over Harran, who had been a law enforcement officer for more than three decades.

“I felt the office was prioritizing some kind of Trumpian politics and not the actual public safety needs of the county,” Ceisler said in an interview with the Guardian last month in Bristol, a township in south-eastern Bucks county.

He went on: “There’s convincing evidence to show that when local law enforcement starts performing immigration enforcement, it hurts public safety. First you take deputies away from their core responsibilities in order to do ICE work. But more importantly, you terrify immigrant communities who [you] rely on to report crime.”

In Bucks county, home to more than half a million people, 70,000 of them foreign-born, the agreement between the outgoing leadership and federal immigration enforcement was met with some strong criticism. Community advocates rallied outside the county’s courthouse and the county’s commissioners argued that Harran had no authority to sign the agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Pennsylvania also filed a lawsuit against Harran, alleging that such 287(g) agreements “open the door to harmful and insidious racial profiling” and “other civil rights violations”.

In October, however, a ruling upheld the agreement between the Bucks county sheriff’s office and ICE. Then just a few weeks later, Harran was ousted by voters.

“I don’t regret doing it,” Harran said when asked about the agreement with ICE. “I think some people got caught in the national hysteria, a lot of people that don’t like Donald Trump and they can’t see the forest through the trees and that’s a shame because with the new sheriff you’re going to have a lot of problems in Bucks county,” he added.

But Ceisler’s victory was not an isolated case in the recent election and instead reflected a broader momentum for Democrats in Bucks county. Voters there elected their first Democratic party district attorney since 1965. In an area where certain books were banned and pride flags in classrooms were forbidden by the authorities, Democrats secured a majority on the school district board, saying people were becoming fatigued with the distracting so-called culture wars, local media reported. The Democratic victories were notable in a congressional district that has been represented by Republican congressman Brian Fitzpatrick since 2017.

And the mini blue wave in the county rippled out from other waves, such as Abigail Spanberger flipping the governorship of Virginia as a moderate Democrat, Mikie Sherrill winning New Jersey’s governor office easily in the end and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani making history as the first Muslim man elected mayor of New York City.

“People were choosing between: do they like what Donald Trump is doing with ICE? Or do they want to see it happening in Bucks county?” said Ceisler, whose term starts in January.

He added: “And in a county that Donald Trump won just a year ago, we are now sending a message to law enforcement all over the country that partnering with ICE is a losing proposition.”

Harran said the Task Force Model “wasn’t fully implemented” in Bucks county while he waited for the resolution of the lawsuit against him. He also said that 17 of his officers “have received training” through the program already. When asked how many immigrants have been detained by officers who received the training, Harran said the number was “very minimal” but did not specify.

While Ceisler reiterated he can’t stop ICE from operating in Bucks county once he becomes sheriff, he said he can keep those 17 officers trained through the Task Force Model from participating in immigration work.

The 287 (g) program was established by Congress in 1996 under Bill Clinton and it was largely discontinued by the Obama administration in 2012 due to concerns about racial profiling following a federal investigation into the Maricopa county sheriff’s office in Arizona.

The Trump administration revived the Task Force Model in January and more than 600 agreements have been signed with local or state agencies in 34 states. In Pennsylvania alone, 49 agencies have signed an agreement with ICE, according to federal data.

Most immigrants in Bucks county live in concentrated areas throughout the region, according to Heidi Roux, director of The Welcome Project, an organization that works closely with vulnerable communities across the state.

In the lower part of Bucks county, in close proximity to Philadelphia, most immigrants are of Latin American descent. Trump visited the area for a staged campaign event in 2024, during which he made fries and served pre-screened customers at a drive-through McDonald’s window in Feasterville. The lower part of Bucks county is also home to thousands of Ukrainians who fled the Russian invasion in 2022.

The county seat, Doylestown, is in the county’s central region, where the immigrant community is mixed between Asian and Latino. Despite increasing urbanization, the upper part of Bucks county is still a vibrant farming community that heavily depends on the immigrant labor force.

“When the 287 (g) program [Task Force Model] was signed, the immigrant community interpreted it as ‘you don’t trust law enforcement, you don’t call law enforcement,’” said Roux, inside the Margaret Grundy memorial library in Bristol.

“We have heard of immigrants who are domestic violence victims who are afraid to call the police because there is fear that they might end up being deported, too. Imagine you have to consider your physical safety as much as your immigration status and that’s why calling 911 is sometimes now an act of extreme courage,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10ab28062ca0cfb4094064cc1966e6fce53e5184/0_306_1179_943/master/1179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6602d44db8b3156f60ae4b7731d83267",N,,2025-12-15 14:56:51.696088

Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.

The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.

Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn't previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.

""This is a big win for the rule of law,"" Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. ""Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.""

The lawsuit is one piece of Kobach's broad range of anti-immigration efforts. He helped Kansas earlier this year become one of the first states in the country to deputize state law enforcement agents to enforce immigration law.

He is party to another lawsuit that seeks to exclude certain immigrants from U.S. Census counts. Kobach argued counting people in the country without particular documentation or with temporary visas skews congressional district apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of ""the whole number of persons in each state"" every 10 years.

He also spent years defending anti-immigration ordinances on behalf of cities, and, as a law professor, he helped craft controversial legislation in Arizona.

Pause on Immigration Benefit Applications for Certain Foreign Nationals

On December 2, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a policy memorandum placing a hold on all applications for asylum (Form I-589) for all foreign nationals and all immigration-benefit requests filed by individuals born in or citizens of the 19 countries listed in Presidential Proclamation 10949, regardless of entry date.

The 19 countries are Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen.

The hold applies to all new and pending applications. This includes employment-based benefit requests filed with USCIS (Form I-129, Form I-140, Form I-765).

Opening remarks by Asst. U.S. Atty. Keith Alexander kicked off an extraordinary trial for a public official. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan is charged with obstruction and concealment for her actions this spring during President Trump’s immigration crackdown.

The trial in federal court in Milwaukee will center on what happened when Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, 31, reported to the county courthouse in April for a hearing on a state crime.

Authorities say Dugan led him out through a back door that led to a public corridor after she told immigration agents to speak with the chief judge about trying to arrest people at the courthouse.

“They did not expect a judge, sworn to uphold the law, would divide their arrest team and impede their efforts to do their jobs,” Alexander told the jury.

He said Dugan informed her court reporter that she “would take the heat” for helping Flores-Ruiz.

The government’s case is expected to run through at least Thursday, with roughly two dozen witnesses lined up to testify. Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts.

She has argued that she was following courthouse protocols on immigration arrests and wasn’t trying to disrupt agents. Her lawyer says Chief Judge Carl Ashley had sent out a draft policy that barred immigration agents from executing certain warrants in nonpublic areas and required court personnel to refer agents to a supervisor.

Agents followed Flores-Ruiz outside the building and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November that he had been deported after he pleaded no contest in the local battery case and was sentenced to time served.

Ahead of the trial, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman declined to dismiss the charges, saying there was no firmly established immunity for Dugan.

Democrats say Trump is looking to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to immigration arrests. Dugan told police she and her family found threatening flyers at their homes this spring. The administration has branded her an activist judge.

DHS “Worst of the Worst” immigrants arrested

DHS reports 1,175 arrests in Florida over the past 11 months — about 6% of the state's 20,000 immigration arrests during the same time.

ICE data show about one-third of those arrested since the start of the Trump administration had no criminal history, and 88% of those detained by Customs and Border Patrol had no prior or pending criminal charges, according to DHS data from September to October.

The Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis administrations have said immigration raids target gang members and criminals. However, 28 of the nearly 5,000 Florida ""encounters"" since Aug. 1 — defined as arrests, contacts in jail, or migrants who were not arrested — were gang-related, according to the State Board of Immigration Enforcement.

That's less than 1%. Of the 27 Treasure Coast arrests DHS listed on its ""worst"" list, one was gang-affiliated.

Immigrants, especially undocumented migrants, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, according to the National Institute of Justice. A Cambridge study also found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than U.S.-born white men.

Some wore clerical collars and ministers’ stoles. Many were older, with gray hair sticking out from under winter hats. After songs and speeches, the crowd turned to face the building for a minute of silent prayer.

The Sisters of St. Joseph, Pax Christi and Casa San Jose have been hosting prayer vigils outside Pittsburgh’s ICE facility every Friday morning since August. They invited religious leaders from different faiths across the city, and plan to continue their weekly demonstrations for as long as they can.

“It has grown into such a supportive community, a very hopeful moment for me in my week,” said Sister Janice Vanderneck of the Sisters of St. Joseph.

On this particular Friday, Vanderneck prayed for her longtime friend who was arrested by ICE agents just a week before. He’s a hard worker, she said, who went to church. His kids are American citizens who attended Catholic schools.

The crowd prayed for the people who may be detained inside the Pittsburgh facility as they await transport to a nearby jail or to ICE’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Clearfield County. They prayed for the ICE officers, too.

“We’re praying for our country to experience a transformation,” Vanderneck said.

Sisters and nuns don’t have the kind of political authority that bishops or priests hold within the church. But local sisters said their unique position comes with more freedom to protest, and they’ve found that their presence is a powerful endorsement.

“We have no authority — just moral authority, and that we have in spades,” Vanderneck said.

Catholic sisters have long held influence in Pittsburgh communities, having built many of its hospitals, schools and other institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Today, nuns and sisters are a dwindling force, but President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has prompted many to speak out and weigh how the politics of the church and the state intersect with their changing ministries.

Drawn to ‘the margins’

Vanderneck walked up a concrete path toward an unmarked back door. She knocked, and when her colleagues welcomed her inside she greeted them with “gracias” and “buenos días.”

Vanderneck is the founder of Casa San Jose, a local Latino immigrant support organization. One November morning, she strode into a windowless room, where a handful of people chattered in Spanish and English and waved at her. After Trump’s return to office, she said the staff moved operations from their Beechview home base to an undisclosed location for fear that ICE agents would target their patrons.

The 75-year-old belongs to the Sisters of St. Joseph, an international congregation of vowed Catholic women with a community in Baden. Through her ministry as a sister, Vanderneck began working with Latino immigrants in Pittsburgh in 2003. She said she quickly learned what life was like for undocumented people facing a lack of resources and attempting to navigate a “wasteland of identity.”

She founded Casa San Jose in 2013 because, as a Spanish speaker, local Latino immigrants often sought her help. At first, it was only Vanderneck and one volunteer working out of a Lutheran church basement. Now, the organization has become an influential immigrant support network, serving families across Pittsburgh.

In January, Casa San Jose began offering new services for those immigrant families as the Trump administration called for mass deportations, spurring ICE raids that have led even documented people to be detained.

“They’re rounding up people that have status or even citizenship,” Vanderneck said. “They’re rounding up people based on what we should not believe in, what we say we don’t believe in in this country — and that is profiling people because of how they look or what they sound like.”

A representative for ICE denied Vanderneck’s claims that the agency profiles detainees based on their appearance, and said ICE only targets individuals who are “illegally in the U.S.”

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement engages in ‘racial profiling’ are reckless and categorically FALSE,” an ICE spokesperson wrote in response to questions from Public Source, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. “ICE law enforcement officers are already facing a more than 1,170% increase in assaults against them. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race or ethnicity.”

Casa San Jose created a rapid response team of volunteers who show up to ICE raids, record officer actions and get the names of people who are detained. They’ve raised money for bail bonds and held clinics to help parents draw up paperwork protecting their children, should they be arrested and separated.

Many Catholics feel their faith compels them to care about immigration issues as part of Catholic Social Teaching. Vanderneck cited a 2003 pastoral letter, a joint statement from the Catholic bishops of the U.S. and Mexico, called “Strangers No Longer.” She said the letter inspired her and other Catholics to view immigration reform as a moral issue, not just a political one.

On Nov. 12, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement urging the American public to “recognize the fundamental dignity of all persons, including immigrants.” The next day, Pittsburgh’s Bishop Mark Eckman released his own statement echoing the USCCB.

Still, there’s division among Catholics about the line between faith and politics.

Vanderneck recently spoke to a local parish about Casa San Jose’s work. While she talked, she watched a man’s face turn red. Later, he told a group of parishioners he was stunned she could advocate for the protection of people who entered the country illegally.

“He represents a large number of Catholics,” Vanderneck said. “I know that, and we know that. The bishops even know that when they speak out … they’re going to get pushback. And they do.”

Other Pittsburgh women’s congregations have been involved in advocacy, too. The Sisters of Mercy, a congregation with deep history in Pittsburgh, attended a No Kings protest in October on Fifth Avenue. The sisters, many of whom are in their 80s, packed their signs in a trunk and drove from their convent at Carlow University.

Sister Cynthia Serjak said she doesn’t think of the church itself as a political instrument.

“Although, I think it’s caught up in a lot of difficult stuff right now,” she said. “But I think we’re not afraid to speak about that.”

Serjak joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1966 when she was 18. In those days, she said, nuns and sisters typically didn’t stray from tradition — or the opinions of a bishop. But times have changed, Serjak said.

“Thank God the Sisters of Mercy have always been open to what’s happening in the world,” Serjak said. “We’re so oriented to tending to those who get pushed to the margins that we have to pay attention, we have to get involved.”

Sisters central to Pittsburgh higher ed, health care

Pittsburgh’s Catholic diocese lists 24 women’s religious communities. Some have local roots dating back hundreds of years.

In 1843, seven women immigrated from Ireland to establish the first Sisters of Mercy convent in the U.S. After five weeks at sea and 60 hours crossing the Allegheny Mountains in a stagecoach, the women arrived in Pittsburgh to find a growing industrial hub with a population plagued by illness, poverty and little access to education.

Catholic sisters built many of the city’s first schools, like Saint Mary’s Academy, established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1844. At their peak in the 1960s, there were more than 13,000 Catholic schools, many staffed by nuns, nationwide.

And in 1847, the Sisters of Mercy opened the world’s first Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh. Nuns and sisters established what is now Carlow University in 1929, and La Roche University in 1963, and they are also active at Duquesne University, founded by a male religious order, the Holy Ghost Fathers.

Sister Mary Pellegrino of the Sisters of St. Joseph said for the most part, religious women aren’t working in classrooms or founding hospitals and colleges anymore.

“Those institutions are built,” she said.

Maintaining those institutions became more difficult as sisters aged and their numbers dwindled. The population of Catholic nuns and sisters in the U.S. reached an all-time high in 1965, peaking around 180,000, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA). Since then, that number has shrunk to fewer than 40,000 in 2022.

Why are fewer young women pursuing religious life today? Some sisters credited the rise in career opportunities and other freedoms for women over the last half century. Others said fewer women became nuns after the sweeping church reforms of Vatican II, when lay people, including women, were given more opportunities to lead within the church.

Vanderneck said she thinks the U.S. has become particularly secular and glorifies independence and financial success above all else. Pellegrino agreed, and said because sisters spend their lives in community, owning nothing and sharing everything, their existence clashes with American capitalist values.

“I actually see religious life right now as more counter-cultural than I have ever seen it,” Pellegrino said.

Nuns and sisters today have had to alter their ministries since taking their vows. Pellegrino said sisters have increasingly found that their influence lies not in their institutions but in their “social capital.” For a significant portion of U.S. women’s congregations today, modern ministry is about bringing “a moral voice into the public square,” she said.

‘Maybe not for us, but after us’: The future of Catholic women’s religious life

The average age of nuns and sisters in the U.S. is reportedly 80, and fewer than 1% are younger than 30. In 2023, CARA reported that 81% of American sisters are 70 or older.

Nuns and sisters in Pittsburgh mirror those demographics. Six local orders responded to interview requests, and none had (or knew of) members younger than 30 in the Pittsburgh area. Serjak told Public Source that, of the 30 women living in her Downtown convent, one is in her 60s, three are in their 70s and the remaining women are in their 80s or 90s. One member will be 100 in January. Pellegrino, 62, said she’s among the youngest in her community.

The absence of young members has nuns and sisters grappling with what the next generation will look like.

In October, Serjak attended a meeting of Sisters of Mercy from across the country, where, amid discussions of their future, they talked about selling property they can’t maintain because “there just aren’t as many of us anymore.”

Many older sisters today, like Serjak and Sister Sheila Carney, joined the vocation as young women, or even teenagers, and have spent practically their entire lives with the women in their religious orders.

But without younger women to care for them, it becomes more difficult for sisters to age together and in place. Serjak said when sisters are moved into nursing homes or hospitals, staff tend to defer to a woman’s blood relatives to make medical decisions, despite her fellow sisters having durable power of attorney. Normally, if a sister is dying, Serjak said they like to be with her, pray and sing over her in her final moments. People outside of the vocation aren’t used to that, she said.

“Our life, which we have always controlled entirely, is now beginning to be not necessarily controlled, but pretty much affected by other people who don’t necessarily understand who we are,” Serjak said. “So when you look at the statistics, I don’t have any guarantee where I’m going to be or who’s going to be taking care of me should I need care. And that feels scary.”

Pellegrino works with a consulting practice that helps aging religious communities prepare for their futures and support their members.

She noted that, while aging sisters might feel grief and fear about their futures, she thinks the concern that religious life will cease to exist is off base. She pointed out that today’s nun population is comparable to the numbers in the early 20th century, before the surge during the ‘60s that still lives in the American consciousness.

Religious life isn’t experiencing a death, she said, but an evolution. She’s watched modern women’s congregations become smaller and more focused on relationships and social justice. But Pellegrino said she can’t speak to what could unfold beyond that.

“There’s something going away, but there’s also something emerging,” she said.

Regardless of what religious life looks like going forward, Serjak and Carney, 80, believe the core mission of their congregation — mercy — will live on. For now, they’ll continue to pray, protest and advocate for compassion.

“We understand that God is in this mess, and we have a confidence that in the end, things will work out — maybe not for us, but after us,” Serjak said. “So you do what you can while you can.”

Schuetze, Minho Kim, Shawn Hubler",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/15/us/trump-news,"Mr. Trump said during his presidential campaign that he could stop the fighting in 24 hours, but the reality has proved different.
The accusations came as Mr. Trump faced resistance in declaring a crime emergency in the capital city in August.
Jeff Asher, a national crime data analyst, said in an interview that the Republican-led report raised questions that the Police Department might be underreporting certain cases of crime.
“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California.
At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles.","Mr. Zelensky also met on Monday with Alexander Stubb, the Finnish president, who had also talked with Mr. Kushner on Sunday, according to Mr. Stubb’s office. Other European leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Secretary General Mark Rutte of NATO, were scheduled to join Mr. Zelensky on Monday evening. Russia was not expected to send representatives.

The Americans and Europeans are scrambling to overcome wide divides over what concessions Ukraine should make to persuade Russia to agree to a cease-fire. The United States has proposed that Ukraine cede some territory that Russia has yet to occupy. Ukraine has said it will not give up more land, a position largely backed by European leaders, who are wary of rewarding Russia for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukraine raised hopes of a compromise on Sunday when Mr. Zelensky reiterated that Kyiv would suspend its goal of joining NATO, at least for now. In return, Mr. Zelensky said, Ukraine would need strong guarantees that the United States would step in if Russia attacked again.

Mr. Zelensky also met on Monday with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, and Julia Klöckner, speaker of the German Parliament, and was expected to also attend a gathering about Ukrainian-German economic ties.

Leaders from Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, as well as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, were all scheduled to arrive in Berlin by Monday evening for a dinner at the chancellery with Mr. Merz, Mr. Starmer, Mr. Macron and Mr. Rutte.

The diplomatic gathering was put together hastily by German, Ukrainian and U.S. officials as pressure mounts to find a compromise to end the war. Mr. Trump said during his presidential campaign that he could stop the fighting in 24 hours, but the reality has proved different.

On Sunday, after receiving both the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations, Mr. Merz posted on social media: “We want lasting peace in Ukraine. Difficult questions lie ahead, but we are determined to move forward.”

The flurry of diplomatic activity comes after American negotiators presented a 28-point peace plan last month that Ukrainians dismissed as being too aligned with Russian interests. European leaders did not dismiss that plan outright, but they have supported Ukraine’s coming up with a counterproposal in which Kyiv would hold onto the territory it currently controls and receive security guarantees from Washington.

European leaders, especially Mr. Merz, Mr. Macron and Mr. Starmer, have been trying to bolster Kyiv’s position and involve themselves in the negotiations because the outcome affects Europe’s broader security as well as Ukraine’s.

Highlighting broader European efforts to restrict Russia and its allies, the European Union announced on Monday that it had sanctioned several people and companies involved in Russian oil sales. The bloc also said that it had made it easier to place sanctions on Belarus, a key ally of Russia.

Reporting was contributed by Jeanna Smialek from Brussels and Maria Varenikova from Kyiv, Ukraine.

The committee said the department’s leadership had encouraged categorizing certain cases of assaults with deadly weapons and burglaries as less serious charges, such as “endangerment with a firearm” and unlawful entry, citing excerpts from interviews with the district commanders. Those lesser categories were excluded from the daily crime statistics reported out to the public, the report said.

The committee also interviewed an eighth commander who was put on leave this year as the Metropolitan Police Department in D.C. investigated alleged altering of crime statistics.

Ms. Smith said last week that she was resigning as police chief at the end of the month, citing a desire to spend more time with her family. She said in an interview with a local Fox affiliate that she had not encouraged the manipulation of crime statistics and denied there was a problem. In any cases of manipulated data, “when it’s brought to my attention, we will hold those members accountable,” she said.

The Justice Department and the president have also heavily criticized Ms. Smith and the Metropolitan Police Department and claimed its data was altered. The accusations came as Mr. Trump faced resistance in declaring a crime emergency in the capital city in August.

His critics cited the trend of decreasing violent crime numbers in Washington and other major cities in recent years to question the president’s rationale for taking over D.C.’s police department and deploying about 2,000 National Guard troops. Mr. Trump called Washington’s crime statistics “phony” and suggested there was a conspiracy, despite having cited those numbers earlier to take credit for the city’s drop in violent crimes.

Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Oversight Committee, said in a statement that Ms. Smith had “coerced staff to report artificially low crime data and cultivated a culture of fear to achieve her agenda.” He suggested that Ms. Smith’s resignation “should not be seen as a voluntary choice” but the result of her “manipulating crime statistics.”

Experts have said that while it is possible the city underreports some crime data on its public website, its official reports to the F.B.I. are still reliable and do show a decline in violent crime.

Jeff Asher, a national crime data analyst, said in an interview that the Republican-led report raised questions that the Police Department might be underreporting certain cases of crime. He said it fell short, however, of providing clear evidence of deliberate or widespread underreporting.

Mr. Asher said his own analysis of Washington’s crime data showed a mismatch between the violent crime numbers that its police department reported to the F.B.I. and the department’s public data. But the overall trend of a decline in violent crime since 2023 in Washington still holds true in the face of some discrepancies, he said.

The Metropolitan Police Department “would be well served to figure out why the underreporting is happening and what they can do to fix it,” Mr. Asher said. “But the decline is clear, well-defined and based on multiple sources.”

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington praised Ms. Smith and the city’s police officers in an emailed statement for a “precipitous decline in crime” and “their hard work and dedication.”

“I thank Chief Smith for her commitment to the safety of D.C. residents and for holding the Metropolitan Police Department to an exacting standard, and I expect no less from our next chief of police,” Ms. Bowser said. The Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent months, Republican lawmakers have tried to impose stricter federal control over the capital city, especially on law enforcement, with the support of some moderate Democrats.

House lawmakers passed bills that would nullify local Washington laws such as those that gave more lenient sentencing to people younger than 25 and allowed cashless bail. Unlike other cities, the District of Columbia is subject to significant federal oversight that allows Congress to review its legislation and rewrite its laws.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is also investigating whether city police officials falsified crime data, which has prompted criticism that the administration is using the levers of the criminal justice system to pursue the president’s political opponents.

Sara Guerrero, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, said her Republican colleagues in the panel were “trying to use this investigation to justify President Trump’s authoritarian power grab.”

“Democrats remain committed to reducing crime by supporting cities in hiring more police and by advancing proven policies like investing in communities and combating gun violence,” she said.

Michael Gold contributed reporting.

The decision by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit effectively blocked the Trump administration from using the remaining 100 or so National Guard troops in California — at least, for the moment.

But the appellate judges temporarily blocked a key part of the order by District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer that would have forced the Trump administration to return control of the troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who ordinarily commands them.

California officials celebrated the move as a partial victory in a battle that has dragged on for months.

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California. Let me repeat: For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement.

“California did not ask to be a testing ground for the president’s militarized vision of America,” he added. “There is no crisis to justify the National Guard’s continued presence, and we look forward to continuing to prove that in court.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles. State and local officials objected strenuously to the move, calling it an inflammatory overreaction to scattered demonstrations that were being ably handled by local and state law enforcement agencies.

Mr. Newsom sued over the initial deployment, but the administration argued that the troops were responding to an emergency and were needed to protect federal agents and property. In June, the Ninth Circuit ruled that conditions in Los Angeles were sufficient for Mr. Trump to take control of the state’s National Guard and direct troops to provide protection during the enforcement of immigration laws.

The administration began gradually drawing down the number of federalized troops in July as public condemnation grew and protests abated. As of last month, about 300 California National Guard members remained under the president’s command, and most were in the process of being released to their usual duties, which generally involve part-time service controlled by the state.

State officials said on Friday that the California deployment consisted of about 100 troops on federal orders that were scheduled to last into February. Last week, Judge Breyer ruled that any emergency the president might have cited as justification for the deployment had long since ended, and that all remaining troops should be released from federal orders and returned to the governor’s command.

Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the law required an emergency only at the time the president decided to federalize National Guard troops, after which he could extend the deployment as long as he deemed necessary. They also said that troops were still needed to protect federal workers from threats stemming from immigration raids that have been intensely unpopular in immigrant-heavy Southern California.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/15/multimedia/15trump-news-promo-noon-cbgz/15trump-news-promo-noon-cbgz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:57:36.201031

The U.S. visa ban adds yet another burden to a country already on its knees as pro-democracy fighters attempt to wrest control from the military-installed provisional government, led by Min Aung Hlaing.
For ordinary Myanmar citizens, getting a U.S. visa has always felt like winning the lottery: rare, difficult, and life-changing.
On social media, frustration over the visa ban has boiled for months.
But even as the visa ban remains in place, she holds on to the hope that one day she’ll walk across Kenyon’s tree-lined campus.","Real journalists wrote and edited this (not AI)—independent, community-driven journalism survives because you back it. Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it

When a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck on March 28 in Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, 20-year-old Kyi Noo Khin watched the walls of her family home crack and crumble. For a moment, she thought she might lose everything.

In June, while still recovering from the aftermath of the quake, another kind of shock struck her.

“It was unexpected, honestly,” Noo Khin said of the Trump administration’s ban on visas from 12 countries, including Myanmar. “I was waiting for my visa interview appointment when the announcement came out.”

In December 2024, Noo Khin was accepted by Kenyon College in Ohio through early decision, a process that allows high school students to apply to a college early, and if accepted, serves as a binding commitment to attend. She was overjoyed that she was accepted and had already applied for a student visa when she heard the news from the Trump administration. Now, her years of study and thousands of dollars invested in U.S. college applications, standardized tests, school deposit and visa fees, and other costs all seem wasted.

“All I needed was visa approval; only one final step left,” she said in an email interview with Prism, describing the emotional damage caused by the ban.

“One moment I was dreaming about how I’m gonna decorate my college dorm room, then next, I was staring at my messy room—still haven’t cleaned the dribbles and dust resulting from the earthquake that took place on March 28—just feeling numb, after hearing the news about the visa ban,” she said. “Like everyone else affected by the earthquake, the family was devastated. In those dark moments, my secured position to go to the States in August had been a good thing we could still look forward to.”

After the Trump administration’s June 9 announcement, Myanmar’s U.S. Embassy posted a statement on its website warning nationals from newly banned countries that while they could still submit visa applications and attend scheduled interviews, “they may be determined to be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States.”

For Noo Khin, the ban didn’t just close a border—it slammed shut a door she spent years trying to open.

Myanmar is still reeling from a 2021 military coup that overthrew the country’s democratically elected government and ignited an ongoing civil war. The U.S. visa ban adds yet another burden to a country already on its knees as pro-democracy fighters attempt to wrest control from the military-installed provisional government, led by Min Aung Hlaing.

Su Chit, director and founder of Royal Suchit, a Yangon-based college consulting firm, told Prism that the demand for student visas surged after the coup, overwhelming the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar and creating monthslong waitlists for interviews—waitlists that now lead to nowhere.

Severed lifeline

Trump’s Proclamation 10949 is an expansive visa ban affecting Afghanistan, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela facing partial visa restrictions. The executive order also suspended most categories of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas for citizens of these nations.

Among them, Myanmar stands out—not for national security concerns or geopolitical aggression, but for alleged administrative noncompliance.

The White House cited high visa overstay rates and noncooperation with deportations as justification for including Myanmar on the list of banned countries. However, before the ban, students from Myanmar applying for U.S. visas underwent rigorous interviews at the U.S. Embassy to demonstrate their financial resources, academic readiness, and intent to return home. Applicants were also required to provide bank statements, financial affidavits, and property deeds to show that they could afford tuition and living expenses. They also had to prove English-language proficiency and strong academic credentials.

The Trump administration’s ban sent ripples through Myanmar communities in the U.S. and abroad, and has drawn criticism for its humanitarian impact.

According to recent data, 3,744 Myanmar students are enrolled in U.S. institutions for the 2025-2026 academic year—a small number compared to other countries, but a sharp increase from 2020-2021 when just 1,698 Myanmar students were enrolled in American colleges. Effectively, the Trump administration’s ban prohibits Myanmar students from studying abroad in the U.S. Meanwhile, the country’s education system remains crippled by decades of military misrule. National exams are unreliable, university degrees carry little value, and since the 2021 coup, the situation in Myanmar has only worsened.

The junta has bombed schools, killed students, and imposed mandatory military conscription. There are also widespread reports of the military detaining young people in the streets and releasing them only after their families pay hefty bribes.

Noo Khin told Prism that the country’s political landscape and new conscription law are among the primary reasons she pursued her education overseas.

“Many youths have to leave to avoid being forcefully drafted to serve or to get killed for the betterment of the military junta,” she said. “When the perfect plan has failed at the last moment, it becomes more difficult to plan from scratch with the current political situation.”

Unlike Trump’s 2017 “Muslim ban,” which drew global rebuke for being discriminatory, the latest visa ban appears to be engineered to withstand legal scrutiny.

According to immigration attorney Helen Partlow, the ban “leans more heavily on administrative factors like visa overstays and deportation cooperation, rather than direct allegations of terrorism or religious bias, making it harder to challenge in court.”

“It is unlikely that these visa restrictions will be reversed during President Trump’s administration, especially if his first term in office is any indication. During his first travel ban in 2017, he faced immediate legal challenges and public backlash. But since then, the administration has doubled down,” Partlow said in an email.

Indeed, the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president wide authority to restrict the entry of noncitizens deemed “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” This authority was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2018 decision Trump v. Hawaii, giving future administrations a powerful tool for sweeping immigration controls.

Across the Myanmar diaspora in the U.S., many feel the Trump administration’s approach betrays Washington’s stated commitment to supporting democracy in Myanmar.

“This ban is unjust and unsympathetic,” Steven Sanyu, a community leader in Buffalo, New York, said in text messages in Burmese. “Since the 2021 military coup, people in Myanmar have been living in terror, with killings and arrests happening daily. If the U.S. wants to be tough, it should target the generals and their cronies—not ordinary people trying to survive.”

In Myanmar’s political landscape, studying abroad is not just a luxury for youth; it’s a lifeline. According to Chit, after the 2021 military coup, a surge in visa applications made securing a visa interview appointment incredibly difficult. Now, that process is effectively meaningless. An Al Jazeera report from 2021 found that the number of student visas approved for Myanmar nationals increased more than tenfold from February to July 2021, with 652 approved in 2021 versus 64 in 2020.

Manmade misery

Despite Myanmar’s economic collapse and unstable currency, Noo Khin’s family invested heavily in her education—$6,000 in tuition and related costs alone—for her to join the Pre-Collegiate Program of Yangon (PCP), a 12-month liberal arts college preparatory course that helps students apply to international universities.

“As a child from a working middle-class background with only one breadwinner, my dad, we could still afford the family’s basic necessities,” Noo Khin explained, “yet I knew that the cost of attending PCP alone held nearly half of my dad’s monthly salary as a division sales manager in a company.”

To reduce expenses for applying to U.S colleges and taking standardized tests, Noo Khin applied for every scholarship and free resource she could find. The PCP helped cover her language education and interview fees associated with meeting admissions officers. She also received a full scholarship for English language proficiency classes.

Still, Noo Khin estimated that she and her family have spent between $12,000 and $14,000 to pursue her dream of studying in the U.S.

Ei Hlaing, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Lynchburg who also serves as co-director of PCP, said students from the most recent cohort who received admissions and scholarships lost their opportunities to attend college in the U.S. due to the visa ban. She noted that the timing could not have been worse because university application deadlines had already passed when the ban was announced.

“Emotionally, they felt crushed,” Hlaing said in an email. “They worked so hard to receive those scholarships. They revised their personal statements numerous times. They were so happy when they got admission to their dream schools in the U.S. with generous financial support. All of that got yanked away from them overnight.”

The professor explained that students now need to spend at least an additional six months in Myanmar to complete a foundation program, or prep course, for U.K. universities, or a foundation year in the U.K. or Malaysia, which adds an additional year to the start of an undergraduate course, with additional costs ranging from $5,000 to $25,000.

Noo Khin was dedicated to attending an American college; now she finds her options incredibly limited. Student visa requirements vary by country, and she doesn’t meet the educational requirements to apply to universities beyond the U.S. She said it feels like she’s “being doomed.”

Chit told Prism that the students she works with at her college consulting firm have studied for years, aced their exams, and secured college admissions in the U.S., requiring their parents to sacrifice everything.

“Now they’ve been told their dreams are over, not because they did something wrong—but because of where they were born,” Chit said in text messages in Burmese.

Equally devastating are those who were selected for the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery. The State Department program grants up to 55,000 immigrant visas each year to people randomly chosen from countries with historically low immigration rates to the U.S. In some cases, people from the countries now barred from entering the U.S. had already been issued visas when Trump’s ban was announced.

Chit said many of these people already sold their homes or took out large loans to cover the costs of flights and the medical checks required for migration to the U.S. Now, they are stuck in limbo.

For ordinary Myanmar citizens, getting a U.S. visa has always felt like winning the lottery: rare, difficult, and life-changing. It has also represented freedom, safety, and a path out of a country where the ruling military regime bombs its own people.

On social media, frustration over the visa ban has boiled for months. Some direct their anger at earlier visa holders who overstayed or sought asylum, accusing them of contributing to the statistics now used to justify the ban.

But immigration attorneys say this resentment is misplaced. Applying for asylum is a right enshrined in U.S. and international law, and it is systemic failures and the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda—not individual actions—that account for today’s conditions.

“The blame is squarely on the Trump administration for invoking a completely unnecessary, unjustified ban,” said immigration attorney David Leopold in a LinkedIn message. “The ban will do little to enhance U.S. national security and much to hurt our worldwide standing.”

For now, Myanmar’s military junta has not commented on the U.S. ban. However, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing said that it was an “honor” to receive a letter from Trump in July threatening a 40% tariff on goods imported from Myanmar starting Aug. 1. Aung Hlaing asked for a reduction in the tariff rate and for the U.S. to lift economic sanctions on Myanmar.

More recently, the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Myanmar nationals, asserting that conditions in the country no longer warrant humanitarian protection. TPS allows nationals from certain countries to lawfully reside and work in the U.S. temporarily. Broadly, the Trump administration has terminated TPS for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. An estimated 3,969 people from Myanmar currently have TPS, which is now set to expire on Jan. 26, 2026.

Critics argue that the Trump administration’s decision to impose a full immigrant-visa ban on Myanmar citizens and end protective status undermines the U.S.’s long-standing claim to support Myanmar’s fragile democratic transition. Instead, the administration has chosen to treat the entire population of Myanmar as a security risk.

Human rights organizations such as EarthRights International argue that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “should not be leading U.S. foreign policy in Myanmar.” The advocacy organization also called on the Trump administration to consult more proactively with Myanmar civil society groups in the U.S. and with members of Congress who are monitoring the conflict, rather than relying on the propaganda of a junta committed to using terror against its fellow citizens.

The decision to terminate TPS for citizens of Myanmar will likely translate to DHS efforts to deport these immigrants from the U.S., despite ongoing political instability, continued fighting between the military regime and resistance forces, widespread displacement, and credible evidence of torture and extrajudicial killings in Myanmar. Human rights organizations across the globe have condemned the Trump administration’s decision. Groups such as Human Rights Watch and experts with the United Nations continue to assert that Myanmar remains deeply unsafe.

Worsening conditions for refugees and asylum-seekers in the U.S., the administration announced in November that it would intensify scrutiny of immigrants lawfully in the U.S. who are from the 19 countries previously listed under Trump-era visa restrictions, including Myanmar.

Trump administration officials have instructed immigration agencies to re-review green card holders, refugees admitted since 2021, and new applicants from these countries under expanded, so-called national security vetting. This step is expected to slow immigration processing significantly, heighten the likelihood of denials, and deepen existing backlogs within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and DHS. Immigrants who have lived lawfully in the U.S. for years now also face uncertainty and fear that routine check-ins or applications may be delayed or challenged under shifting standards.

The visa ban, the rollback of TPS, and the heightened scrutiny of immigrants from visa-ban nations represent a broad tightening of U.S. immigration policy—one that disproportionately affects individuals from countries such as Myanmar who are fleeing conflict, authoritarian governments, or state-sponsored violence.

In Mandalay, Noo Khin continues to mourn her losses. But even as the visa ban remains in place, she holds on to the hope that one day she’ll walk across Kenyon’s tree-lined campus.

“Since it was an [Early Decision] acceptance, I had withdrawn from all the other schools I applied to, so I didn’t have a backup plan,” she said. “I still look at the acceptance letter mail sometimes, and it still makes me feel happy but with a hint of melancholy now.”

Noo Khin is now looking into options in other countries, but the process feels daunting.

“I hate the words: ‘This happens for the better,’” she said. “In my case, it is not because of destiny or fate. It is a man made misery.”",https://prismreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2239616201-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:57:58.098807

Country/Region

Amid the horrors of the Sudan civil war, questions are once again being raised over what role EU funds have played in the ongoing conflict and, in particular, alleged genocide in Darfur at the hands of the Rapid Support Forces militia. Statewatch is republishing a powerful 2018 article by the journalist Caitlin L Chandler for The New Humanitarian, which explains the background to and effects of the EU’s “migration management” cooperation with Sudan.

Introduction

In mid-November, two Swedish MEPs wrote to the European Commission to highlight allegations that EU migration funds had been used to support a paramilitary group accused of committing genocide in Sudan.

Jonas Sjöstedt and Hanna Gedin, both with The Left group in the European Parliament, referred to claims that some of the €200m provided to Sudan for ‘migration management’ through the Khartoum Process was channelled to the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, currently locked in a brutal civil war with the Sudanese military.

They asked the Commission – which has not yet responded – to explain what steps it had taken to investigate this allegation, and whether any wider review is planned into irregularities in the management of Khartoum Process funds.

With questions again being raised over the EU’s complicity in backing the Rapid Support Forces (in the press as well as the European Parliament), Statewatch is republishing a powerful 2018 article written by journalist Caitlin L Chandler for The New Humanitarian. It explains the background of the Khartoum Process and how little safeguards or oversight were put in place as funds were handed over.

The article remains relevant as ever: even as the EU issues statements condemning the actions of the RSF, they shy away from questions about their own involvement in funding them. One reason for their reticence to respond could be that they continue to pour billions of euros into the pockets of actors with little regard for human life or rights, with similarly little safeguards or oversight, in the name of “migration management.”

Inside the EU’s flawed $200 million migration deal with Sudan

By Caitlin L. Chandler

As millions of dollars in EU funds flow into Sudan to stem African migration, asylum seekers say they are increasingly trapped, living in a perpetual state of fear and exploitation in this key transit country.

In interviews with over 25 Eritrean and Ethiopian asylum seekers in Khartoum and the eastern city of Kassala, as well as local journalists, and lawyers working on behalf of refugees, IRIN has documented allegations of endemic police abuse, including extortion, violence, and sexual assault.

The pattern of corruption and rights violations uncovered feeds into broader concerns over whether the EU’s migration policies are making a difficult situation worse.

Across Sudan's capital, Khartoum, some 30,000 Eritrean, Ethiopian, and other African refugees are crammed into decrepit, non-descript houses, waiting for their chance to escape the country and make it to Europe.

Sudan’s previously porous northern border with Libya has become increasingly dangerous to cross after Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir deployed the former Janjaweed – a paramilitary group implicated in war crimes during the Darfur conflict – in 2015 as border guards.

This militia, re-named the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and integrated into Sudan’s army in January 2017, arrests asylum seekers and hands them over to the police, who detain, fine, and deport them for illegal entry – regardless of whether returning them to their countries will result in torture or imprisonment.

Tortured for money

The Shagarab refugee camp appears out of nowhere, a sprawling, dusty settlement in eastern Sudan near the Eritrean border, two hours by road from the main town of Kassala, through a series of tightly controlled checkpoints that require police permission to pass.

Some 40,000 refugees, primarily Eritreans, are registered at Shagarab, but it feels deserted. For many Eritreans, the camp is only a temporary stop for two or three months before the next stages of their journey, on to Khartoum, and then on to Libya or Egypt, before the final goal of Europe.

Inside Shagarab’s centre for unaccompanied minors, teenagers watch TV and stay glued to their mobile phones, eager to be in contact with the outside world. But some have experienced awful abuse at the hands of traffickers as they escaped from Eritrea – one of the world’s most oppressive states – and into Sudan.

Dawit*, 17, fled Eritrea to escape military conscription – in a country where unpaid army service can last for years – travelling first to Ethiopia and then hiring smugglers to take him into Sudan.

He couldn’t pay the smugglers up front, and so once inside Sudan was trafficked and held for ransom in Hajer, a town almost all Eritrean refugees interviewed by IRIN mentioned as a place to avoid.

“Sudanese smugglers tortured us for the payment,” said Dawit. “They stripped us naked and beat us with whips while our families were on the [telephone] line. New arrivals had two-three days after arrival to pay before being beaten.

“Those who had been there longer were beaten every day. The women fared even worse – men would come, pick them out, and take them away. When they returned, they were bleeding and crying.”

Dawit said that after being held for five days, the smugglers got a call warning them that there was about to be a police raid, and they all escaped.

The tip-off is entirely in keeping with numerous accounts of the involvement of Sudanese officials in the trafficking industry.

A history of migration

Sudan has long been a transit country for Eritreans and others on the move, as well as a country people flee from.

Sudan’s increasing criminalisation of refugees and migrants, as well as conditions in Libya, where the EU backs the Libyan coastguard to capture refugees at sea and return them to detention centres, have contributed to a steep drop in the number of people arriving in Italy.

In 2016, 40,773 refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa arrived in Italy; in 2017, only 8,688 people made it.

Yet young Eritrean men and women in Khartoum and Kassala told IRIN they had no intention of remaining in Sudan, despite being aware of the risks of using smugglers to take them through Libya and Egypt, where they can experience torture and death.

Some said they would wait for new, safer routes to open, while others were working as maids and daily labourers to raise enough money to start the journey as soon as possible.

“When I came from Eritrea, I was kidnapped for two weeks. I didn’t know where I was, and I was raped many times. So, nothing [worse] will happen to me. All of us left our families behind,” said a young Eritrean woman in Khartoum. “We’ll take the risk of going to Europe.”

Over the past two years, the EU has allocated more than $200 million in migration-related funds to Sudan, part of its broader strategy to outsource migration control to third countries.

EU financing for border management includes training and equipment for border police, capacity building for the judiciary, and legal reforms to encourage increased arrests and prosecution of traffickers and smugglers.

This support is despite the fact that the Sudanese government has for years been condemned for its human rights record – al-Bashir has an outstanding arrest warrant for crimes against humanity issued by the International Criminal Court.

The EU sidesteps accusations it is working with Sudan’s repressive security apparatus by arguing that it doesn’t fund the government directly, rather it funnels its aid through international organisations, including UN agencies.

But these EU partners are willing to work with controversial arms of the Sudanese government.

For example, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, confirmed to IRIN it has provided motorbikes in Kassala to the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) – a spy service responsible for the arrest, torture, and detention of human rights activists and the government’s political opponents.

Extortion and abuse

In densely populated Khartoum neighbourhoods like al-Geraif and al-Daim, groups of 10 to 15 Eritrean refugees live in sub-divided shanty houses. Rooms are occupied by entire families or as many as eight single young men and women at a time.

Many rely on donations from family members abroad to afford food, children’s school fees, and other basic expenses. Those without family support are destitute, eating only one meal a day, without access to proper sanitation or medical care.

Filmon, 21, arrived in Sudan in November 2016 from Ginda, Eritrea. He shares a dirty, cramped room with five other young men. Until recently, it lacked a latrine.

“Life in Khartoum is very hard. I don’t get enough money or good work and it’s not a safe area,” he told IRIN. “I’ve been asked [by the police] about my cards, my refugee card, regularly. I think about going to Europe through Libya – I have no choice,” he said.

Although Sudan has a policy that refugees must live in camps, the majority of Eritreans either stop in them just long enough to claim asylum status and collect an identification card, or head directly for Khartoum. Many have travelled with smugglers, and some have experienced trafficking, violence, and sexual assault crossing into Sudan or once inside.

In Khartoum, they find a prison of a different kind. Refugees report being terrorised by the police, who enter their neighbourhoods – sometimes in the middle of the night – and extort and detain people for not having ID cards. Cash and valuables are routinely stolen.

Sara is a bubbly young Eritrean woman who attends henna training classes. She told IRIN how she was arrested on the street for not having her refugee card, and at the police station was offered a choice: “If you want to be free, you will have sex with us.”

Sara, who was 17 at the time, narrowly avoided being raped because her 19-year-old female companion went with the policemen instead.

Feeding corruption

Each month, police funnel hundreds of refugees and migrants through courts in Khartoum, where they are charged with violating Sudan’s Passport and Immigration Act and fined the equivalent of $360.

If they do not pay the fines, they are deported to their home country, usually without having the opportunity to consult a lawyer or claim asylum, even though some may have experienced violence, torture, and other acts in Sudan or in their home countries that could qualify them.

Hundreds of Eritreans have been extradited over the past two years, including some who were registered as refugees. Deporting an asylum seeker back to the country they fled from and where they face persecution is known as refoulement, and it is a violation of the UN Refugee Convention.

Lawyers working to represent refugees in court before they are extradited describe a justice system that is just as corrupt as the police force.

“In many cases the traffickers are let go because they have police officers as [defence] witnesses,” said Khalid, a lawyer working in Khartoum. “There are trials where 250 refugees are arrested, and each one is fined. It happens so fast – the process of being arrested, the trial and the conviction – and the judge and the police force responsible get a cut of the money. These judges are the same ones who were trained by the British embassy.”

The Khartoum Process

Europe’s focus on curbing migration from Sudan began in November 2014, with the launch of the Khartoum Process – a dialogue between the EU and Horn of Africa countries to combat trafficking and smuggling. It initially emphasised protection and human rights, but in operation its focus has been a law enforcement response to migration.

In 2015, Brussels created a special pot of money – the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa – to assist the Khartoum Process in addressing the root causes of migration and fighting trafficking and smuggling.

An Oxfam analysis found that of the €400 million allocated through the fund, only three percent went towards developing safe and regular routes for migration. The bulk was spent on migration control.

Police Lieutenant General Awad al-Neel Dahiya, head of the Ministry of Interior Passports and Civil Registry Authority and a key interlocutor for the EU’s migration efforts, believes the focus is justified.

“As a matter of fact, we have very long borders – 7,000 kilometres plus,” he told IRIN. “Compared to our resources, it is very difficult to control – maybe we can be assisted by technology, so we can control the influx, as well as those going out – whether its Sudanese [people or people from] other countries passing through Sudan.”

But Sudanese specialists say the EU is operating on the flawed assumption that the government is sincere in wanting to end the lucrative trafficking business.

“There is a lack of political will from the Sudanese government to fight trafficking,” Rifat Makawi, another lawyer in Khartoum, explained. “Creating new policies and drafting laws is just done by the government to please Western countries. On the ground, nothing changes.”

A recent report from the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat noted that despite the flurry of anti-smuggling and trafficking efforts, new smuggling routes continue to open across the Horn, with Eritrean and Sudanese smuggling networks gaining influence.

One estimate puts the profits of the smuggling business on the northwestern route from the Horn of Africa to Europe at approximately $203 million in 2016.

An uncomfortable alliance

The US State Department’s 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report concludes that Sudan “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.”

Human Rights Watch has accused the security forces, including the RSF, of colluding with human traffickers and smugglers rather than investigating them.

The EU’s interest in managing migration has precipitated a sharp shift in how member countries engage with Khartoum. For years, European governments avoided dealing with al-Bashir because of the ICC arrest warrant and his rights record, but there has been something of a sea change.

The UK is now engaged in a biannual “strategic dialogue” focused on migration, trade, and counter-terrorism. Italy has signed a policing agreement on trafficking, irregular immigration and terrorism; and Norway is discussing an agreement to facilitate easier deportation of Sudanese asylum seekers. Belgium recently allowed Sudanese security officials to vet asylum-seekers; those who were then deported back to Sudan were detained, interrogated and tortured.

Michael Aron, the UK ambassador to Sudan, said the EU can influence police behaviour through dialogue. “There are people we talk to in the police who are definitely trying to do the right thing,” he explained. “We should be helping the good guys so they can increase their influence over decision-making and gradually get the situation more under control.”

Meanwhile, over the past three years, the Sudanese government has made it clear it expects the EU to provide funds and equipment for its migration control efforts.

The head of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan, regularly boasts about the RSF’s role in assisting the EU. He recently told Al Jazeera: “[The EU] lose[s] millions in fighting migration, that's why [it has] to support us.""

The EU ambassador to the Sudan, Jean-Michel Dumond, rejects criticism of Europe’s relationship with Khartoum. “We have been accused of all the sins of the world, and it’s quite clear we have never cooperated with the RSF – we have no link,” he told IRIN. “[EU] aid is given [under] very clear conditions.”

Meanwhile, former border control officials from European countries are arriving in Khartoum as consultants, replacing development experts in some international agencies. One of the latest EU-funded projects is a Regional Command Center in Khartoum (ROCK), to be run by Civipol out of the Sudanese police training compound.

“The migration issue is becoming like the Darfur crisis, it’s a business,” said Fatima, a Sudanese journalist covering migration who also pointed to the creation of numerous new government charities that have started turning up at migration-related meetings. “Everyone wants a piece of the pie,” she added.

“Where to keep them?”

Yusef, an Eritrean refugee, tried to head to Europe in 2014 via Libya, but was returned to the Sudanese border by a militia in Libya. There, he was arrested, along with hundreds of other refugees.

The Sudanese border guards brought Yusef to the northern town of Dongola that now serves as an informal detention facility for refugees captured at the border.

On the three-day journey, Yusef alleges that over 50 people died from lack of food, water, and medical care. Their pleas for help went unanswered. “We told them our friends are dying, are thirsty, hungry, suffering. They don’t protect you,” he told IRIN.

In Dongola, Yusef was kept in a large compound along with hundreds of other people. Eight Bangladeshi men in the facility paid and were immediately released, along with a number of Somalis and Sudanese. But the Eritreans and Ethiopians were detained for a month.

Yusef said he counted nine people who died due to lack of medical care. Representatives of the UN visited – a team of four foreigners with an Eritrean translator – and told the inmates that if they had a refugee card they could go back to the Shagarab refugee camp in eastern Sudan, or else they would be deported.

Yusef had a refugee card but did not trust the UN or the Sudanese government to protect him. To avoid being sent back to Eritrea, where he could likely face torture and imprisonment, Yusef claimed to be Ethiopian. He was deported to Ethiopia, and crossed back into Sudan a few weeks later.

Monitoring from afar

The EU is now planning to work in Dongola through its flagship Better Migration Management project, a $46 million regional programme run by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), in partnership with the International Organization on Migration (IOM), Italian police and Civipol, a consulting wing of the French ministry of interior, among other organisations.

“The proposal came from us, because we have nowhere to keep people,” said Dahiya, the head of Sudan’s Ministry of Interior Passports and Civil Registry Authority. “Every month we have to intercept almost 100 or sometimes 500 irregular migrants; we have to process their return and their protection – it gives us real challenges – where to keep them?”

According to the UK ambassador, BMM will set-up a centre in Dongola to help receive the arrested refugees and migrants. But it’s not clear how human rights abuses will be monitored, especially somewhere where there are no international NGOs or observers at present.

Martin Weiss, the BMM project head in Germany, insists the programme aims to protect migrants.

“BMM is not about border surveillance, but about protecting refugees, facilitating migration, and improving conditions for people who are fleeing their homes,” he wrote in an email. “At present, many refugees are vulnerable to violence, slavery or rape. We want to provide an effective response to the problem.”

But the EU and its partners don’t appear to have a viable strategy to mitigate human rights abuses. In the case of the BMM project, the EU and GIZ claim that its steering committee – composed of the European Commission, Germany, UK, France, Italy, and the Netherlands – oversees human rights risks remotely from Brussels.

“The steering committee has a clear view of what is possible and what is not possible,” said Dumond, “and we don’t think there is a big risk [of human rights violations as a result of EU funding].”

He added that EU officials frequently go on mission in Sudan to assess conditions first-hand.

But such visits are tightly controlled by the government and the security services. When IRIN visited Shagarab, for example, police and NISS officers followed, transcribing every interview.

The EU and GIZ also declined to show country specific budgets for Sudan for the BMM programme. That opacity is a way to escape “accountability and scrutiny”, explained Giulia Laganà, a migration specialist at the Open Society European Policy Institute, via email.

Rethink needed

The situation Yusef faced in Eritrea forced him to leave. Stricter border controls did not deter him in striving for a better life, and neither did the rights abuses he encountered. Yet there is no indication the EU is open to adjusting its migration management strategy in the face of mounting criticism that its approach in Sudan is not only ineffective but also causing harm.

“The real root causes of migration are very complex,” said Dumond. “You cannot hope to address all these problems and have quick solutions in a few months.”

But a new report from the International Refugee Rights Initiative, The Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), and The Centre for Human Rights Law at SOAS, University of London, argues that a re-think is urgently needed.

“As barriers are created without sufficient alternatives being offered, people are taking greater and greater risks and journeys are becoming increasingly dangerous,” the study found. “The only people benefitting … are the smugglers and traffickers.”

Turkish authorities should protect those Uyghurs who consider Turkey a second homeland, and not put them in harm’s way.","Since late 2016, Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in northwestern China have been victims of crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Chinese government. As an international student living in Istanbul at that time, I decided not to return home and instead started publicly advocating on behalf of hundreds of thousands of arbitrarily detained Uyghurs in China. They include my father, Memet Yaqup, who disappeared in 2018 and is now serving a 16-year prison sentence, having committed no crime.

Until recently, the Turkish government had provided protection with preferential treatment for Uyghurs like me due to our Turkic origin. This made many of us eligible for long-term residence permits and subsequently Turkish citizenship. However, over the last couple of years, as Turkey has adopted increasingly anti-immigrant policies and China-Turkey relations warm, various administrative malpractices have not only nullified that preferential treatment – they have put members of my community at risk of forcible return to China.

Based on my recent research, Turkish authorities have arbitrarily assigned “restriction codes” to some Uyghurs, among other refugees and migrants, considering them public-security threats, often without evidence or any reasonable justification. The Turkish government has cited laws pertaining to foreigners and international protection in doing so, but the criteria and rationale for how these codes are currently assigned is unclear.

A simple complaint from a neighbour, even if deemed unfounded later, can result in the application of restriction codes in Turkey. The Chinese government has submitted lists to the Turkish authorities of people Beijing considers terrorists, in some cases for peaceful activism or expression of Uyghur identity. Some people on these lists have also ended up being tagged with restriction codes.

Such codes can lead to a cascade of negative and often devastating consequences, including denial of international protection, or denial of other statuses that entitle a person to residency or would provide a path to citizenship. This has had the effect of categorizing Uyghurs restricted by these laws as irregular migrants subject to deportation. If they are picked up by police or immigration officers for any reason, they can be sent to a deportation centre.

Turkish immigration authorities have pressed, and at times forced, Uyghur detainees (along with others from Syria or Afghanistan) to sign voluntary return forms.

Although the Turkish government has a policy against deporting Uyghurs directly to China, they have deported them to other countries where they are at risk of return.

I interviewed a person whom Turkish immigration authorities deported in 2019 to the United Arab Emirates, which has an extradition treaty with China. This person left the UAE and traveled through several other countries before reaching a safe destination. During that time, Chinese government agents harassed him and pressed host governments to send him back to China. Local immigration authorities in two of his transit countries detained him.

Under Turkish law, individuals can appeal these deportation decisions. However, according to a lawyer I spoke to who has made such appeals many times, judges often make a negative decision when they see restriction codes attached to a file, just to be safe.

I reviewed a number of cases in which Turkish courts ruled that the international prohibition on sending people back to a place where they would face danger does not apply for the Uyghurs. There is ample evidence, though, that Uyghurs returned to China face detention, interrogation, torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading types of treatments, especially if they come from countries Beijing arbitrarily deems “sensitive,” including Turkey.

As my community went through the pain of family members being forcibly disappeared back home, Turkey provided me the lifeline I needed. I graduated with a PhD in international relations from Turkey’s Koç University and feel privileged and grateful to have obtained Turkish citizenship. But that privilege is not the case for many other Uyghurs.

Many Uyghurs I speak with, from all over the world, including those in London, where I currently live, love Turkey and feel like home when they walk through Uyghur neighbourhoods in Istanbul. It is probably one of the few places where Uyghurs thrive and embrace their identity, culture and religion, while simultaneously existing as vibrant members of a cosmopolitan city. It is also the city where one can find the most delicious Uyghur cuisine, traditional clothing and Uyghur language books.

Turkish authorities should protect those Uyghurs who consider Turkey a second homeland, and not put them in harm’s way.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/12/202512eca_asia_tu%CC%88rkiye%20_china_Uyghur.jpg?h=8aa5fa2d&itok=0yLMByCs,N,,2025-12-15 11:58:15.745933

Arab American Institute

Analysts are still working to understand Zohran Mamdani’s decisive victory in last month’s New York mayoral race. Like the blind men in the old Indian story of the “Blind Men and the Elephant,” the explanations offered have been mostly accurate but incomplete.

Mamdani’s focus on affordability was clearly appealing, as was his compelling affability on display in clever and incisive social media posts. The fact that he was constantly on the move, meeting and engaging voters where they were, was also a factor in his favor. It communicated his authentic desire to know voters and have them know him.

In the stale consultant-driven political environment in which we find ourselves, Mamdani was a breath of fresh air. With his opponents spending tens of millions on negative attack ads, Mamdani’s approach was new and exciting. Despite running against the well-funded campaign of a former governor and much of the New York Democratic Party establishment that saw him as a threat to their hegemony, he not only prevailed but also won more votes than any previous mayoral candidate in the city’s history.

Three other factors were also decisive in shaping the outcome.

The first is the changing demographics of New York City. In 1980, more than one-half of the city’s population was white. Today it is less than one-third white. In 1980, 1,400,000 New Yorkers were Hispanic. Today they number 2 ½ million. During this same period, New York’s Black population remained fairly stable at about 1,700,000, though over one-third of today’s Black population are immigrants or the descendants of recent immigrants from African or Caribbean countries. One of the biggest shifts has been the dramatic growth of New York’s population of Asian descent. They have grown from a few hundred thousand to 1,400,000.

These changing demographics in favor of newer immigrant communities resulted in substantial shifts in the composition of the electorate and it mattered in this election. Mamdani easily won among Asian, Hispanic, and Black voters. But it’s important to note that he almost evenly split the white vote with his main opponent. Performing that well among all demographic groups is unusual in New York politics.

Another critically important factor in Mamdani’s win was the role an empowered grassroots movement played. The political group that powered his victory was the Democratic Socialists of America. With thousands of organizers throughout New York City, they had already accounted for a number of upset wins during this past decade. The first was in 2018, when upstart Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Congressman Joseph Crowley. At the time of his defeat, Crowley was the Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party and Vice-Chair of the Democratic Caucus in Congress. In many ways, Ocasio-Cortez’s win presaged Mamdani’s. Crowley had the support of the establishment and far more money than his unknown insurgent opponent, but the party apparatus he headed had grown lazy and stale. She had a grassroots movement that out-organized the establishment.

In the years that followed, DSA activists won a number of elections for state and local posts across the city (including Mamdani’s 2021 election to New York State Assembly). They showed that an organization of energized grassroots activists can defeat the establishment and their money.

A final factor that played a critical role in Mamdani’s victory was the impact of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza on the electorate in general, and specifically on the Jewish community in New York City.

For decades, the accepted political wisdom was that because of the size of the Jewish community in New York City, a political candidate who wanted to win there had to pay homage to Israel. It was assumed that the Jewish community was in lock-step with Israel and that those who wanted their votes or support should act accordingly. This not only silenced any reasoned discussion of the Middle East, but also had a devastating impact on the ability of Arab Americans and, especially after 9/11, American Muslims to freely participate in the city’s political life.

One example stands out. In 1988 Jesse Jackson’s presidential bid became the first to welcome the Arab community into a presidential campaign. The New York rally and fundraiser Arab Americans organized for Jackson was one of his most successful events. When, the following year, one of Jackson’s New York co-chairs announced that he would run for mayor, the Arab community was ready to play a part. Early in the year, I was called to New York by the candidate and his campaign manager. They told me that the city’s Jewish establishment was upset by the role Arabs had played in Jackson’s effort and by Jackson’s embrace of Palestinian rights. They told me, “Tell your people we don’t want their support. If the Arabs give us a thousand dollars, the Jewish community will raise one hundred thousand to defeat us. Keep them away.”

I left the meeting shocked and upset and went to prominent Jewish writers I knew at the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Village Voice and told them what had happened. They wrote scathing attacks on this bigoted exclusion. But, fear still won, and the exclusion continued.

Given this context, it becomes clear what an enormous difference was in evidence in this year’s New York election. The impact of Israel’s war on Gaza transformed politics. Support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s genocidal policies have become mainstream issues. Arabs and Muslims are welcomed. At the same time, this election shattered the myth of a monolithic Jewish vote. Despite the hysterical anti-Mamdani reaction of the Jewish establishment (more than one leader referred to him as “the enemy of the Jewish community”), the majority of young Jews supported Mamdani, along with more than one-third of all Jewish voters.

Combined, these factors demonstrate how New York City has changed, the city’s Democratic Party is changing, and the Arab American, American Muslim, and American Jewish communities are changing—all for the better. The bottom line: It’s not your daddy’s New York anymore.

On a recent evening, in the back of a cavernous church basement, he led a training for over two dozen people gathered on folding chairs. Translators and volunteers sat at rows of tables. The session was dedicated to helping immigrants navigate the intense scenes in the Manhattan courthouses where masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have taken to snatching people who show up for scheduled hearings and routine appointments.

After Sirabella ran through his presentation and encouraged people to sign up to help with multiple programs, one volunteer asked, “Where is your need greatest?”

Sirabella explained that his top priority is assembling a team of multilingual volunteers who can reach out to immigrants they have encountered on their days acting as observers and escorts in court.

“My goal, my vision is that everyone we’ve met in court since March is notified; they know we’re here, we’re open, and we’re ready to support them,” Sirabella explained. “Whether they choose to go to us is up to them.”

He is particularly eager to recruit Spanish speakers to spread the word about the clinic.

“People are really terrified, getting a phone call from a stranger,” he said. “They think it’s ICE, so it’s vital to have someone who can call them in Spanish or text and tell them to come here and get help.”

Sirabella is a retired marketing executive from Brooklyn who volunteers with the New Sanctuary Coalition, an organization that was founded in 2007 with the goal of giving immigrants tools to lead their own advocacy and navigate the legal system. Along with leading the weekly clinic, Sirabella also plays a key role in the group’s court accompaniment program, which provides in person support for immigrants as they face the masked agents in Manhattan’s courts.

“I looked for some way of — not serving meals or something — but really helping people where rubber meets the road,” Sirabella said in an interview.

During this second Trump era, NSC has become a key part of New York City’s Undocumented Underground, which includes other advocacy organizations that are running legal clinics and court watching efforts. In churches and meeting rooms around the city, networks of activists and advocates are engaged in the painstaking, mundane work of untangling the cases of thousands of immigrants caught up in Trump’s mass deportation machine.

Sirabella said he “sort of fell into” the role of heading up the NSC’s legal clinic because he was a member of a church that had an optimal space. The clinic is a key engine behind the group’s work escorting migrants in court and trying to release those who have been detained. Inside, volunteers are trained to participate in accompaniment. They also provide ongoing help with cases and give migrants resources to represent themselves. NSC refers to the people they work with as “friends.”

“We’re here to serve them,” Sirabella said.

Throughout the night I watched him at the clinic, Sirabella was at the center of a quiet whirlwind, jumping between trainings and answering questions about a steady stream of immigration cases. He refers to the weekly scene at the clinic as “fluid yet orchestrated chaos.”

As with many of the stories in this series, I agreed not to identify the specific location of the church or the exact day of the clinic since many of the migrants who visit there face the threat of detention and deportation. I also granted anonymity to some of the volunteers involved in these programs.

Sirabella explained that the legal clinic typically draws 30 to 40 volunteers each week. NSC also has another weekly meeting that includes training and counseling for migrants. During my visit to the church, only a handful of immigrants were present. Many of the volunteers meet with those they work with privately and bring their documents and questions to the weekly events. Sirabella said the group is trying to “beef up” the number of migrants who seek help in person.

“It’s really a scary time and people are afraid to trust people,” he said.

After Sirabella wrapped up his briefing on court accompaniment, a woman named Sarah began a training on how to file motions to request a virtual hearing. NSC volunteers assist with those filings to help migrants keep their efforts to obtain legal residency alive without facing the chaos in the courts downtown.

“Right now, ICE is at the courts, waiting outside the rooms, and taking people from the halls,” Sarah said. “They’re basically extrajudicially taking people. No one knows who or why. It’s very terrifying for our friends, and there’s no oversight of detention conditions.”

As Sarah continued, Sirabella began doing laps around the basement. For the rest of the night he was on the move. People grabbed him to talk about individual cases. Others sought his advice on strategies for using Google Translate to communicate with friends. At points, he stopped and called out to the room to encourage people to sign up for Signal chats and to note which trainings they’d received on various attendance sheets. One group of three women pulled him aside and explained that they were all attorneys.

Sirabella stressed that they should always make clear they are a “volunteer” and “not acting as a lawyer.” NSC has forms they provide to friends that detail this distinction. It’s an important one to avoid mistaken impressions, to protect the organization from lawsuits, and to ensure the individuals working with them have the opportunity to continue representing themselves before the courts.

As Sirabella went over this with the trio, he was pulled away by a volunteer who brought over someone who spoke multiple languages. He quickly went with her to another corner of the room where people were working on plans for the outreach effort.

“This is our polyglot of the day,” Sirabella said as he steered the new volunteer into the group.

Sirabella was then corralled by someone who introduced him to a Colombian man who was holding an accordion folder overflowing with documents. Through a translator, Sirabella learned the man was looking for help on an asylum application. Sirabella paired him with a Spanish- speaking volunteer before continuing his rounds of the basement.

The next person to grab Sirabella was a man named Mark who was leading a group working on issues related to Special Immigrant Juvenile status (SIJS), one of the major tools advocates use to help young, eligible migrants obtain citizenship. Mark was wielding three different clipboards and had a bit of good news about a family’s case that had been disjoined.

“Their cases got put back together with the good judge that we want,” Mark said.

Someone else tried to pull Sirabella away. Mark grabbed his arm and drew him into a discussion about setting up a workflow for an operation focused on SIJ.

“Wait John,” he said. “You have to listen.”

NSC and other church programs around the city including the “welcome center” featured previously in this series have relatively formalized SIJS effort. Some advocates have also relied on a loose network of activists who are helping with court paperwork.

One part of this effort is “NYC 4 All,” which came together largely based on happenstance and word of mouth. An organizer who helped form the group told TPM that it began to coalesce about two years ago as Republican leaders were dispatching buses full of migrants to the city. The organizer was bringing “van loads” of winter clothes donated from wealthier neighborhoods in Brooklyn to churches and shelters where the migrants were staying.

“One of the pastors heard me speak Spanish and tried to recruit me to do the legal help that they were trying to provide,” the organizer said. “I actually resisted because, you know, it’s a lot of work, and I’m retired, and I did not want to commit.”

That reticence faded when they saw the “crazy situation” unfolding at the shelters.

“Hundreds and hundreds of people were coming,” the organizer explained.

Eventually, they said about 40 volunteers were working on the project. At times, they operated out of a storefront provided by a local business. The group focused on helping people from eligible nations apply for Temporary Protected Status, which is available to individuals from countries that have been designated as unsafe due to factors including armed conflicts and natural disasters. As soon as Trump retook the White House in January 2025, his administration set to work eroding the program. While this effort has been met with some legal challenges, the administration has succeeded in ending TPS protections for multiple countries.

After losing TPS as an option, the NYC 4 All volunteers began to, as the organizer put it, “switch into gear for SIJS.”

“It’s a whole other set of laws to figure out. So it took our little TPS group a minute,” the organizer said, adding, “Most of our kids have, usually, a death, or have a parent who is abusive, or who has … stopped support, which is why they left and came here. … The other half that aren’t from abusive situations are orphans.”

Volunteers serve as guardians in the court process for youth who do not have one parent in the U.S. with them. They also work to help the applicant orient themselves.

“We help that kid navigate New York City,” the organizer explained. “Whether that means getting a driver’s license and an ID, or getting enrolled in school, or helping them get health care or whatever it is. We step in to kind of translate New York City to the youth.”

Since, as the organizer put it, “asylum is subjective” and based on an individual judge’s decision, they came to believe SIJS is “the easiest thing” for those who are eligible. However, like so much of the immigration process, it has become harder in the new Trump administration.

“Trump started charging the kids a $250 application fee. Where [would] they get that? God knows because they don’t have work authorization and he won’t give them work authorization,” the organizer said.

The Trump administration also directed judges to stop granting deferred deportation orders to youth who are in the process of applying for SIJS. The organizer laid out the trap this creates for these young migrants.

“So, the courts have declared that they’re abandoned. They come from horrible situations, they’ve got nobody, and they’ve got to come up with money from a job they don’t have legally,” the organizer said. “They’re exploited as food service delivery guys, or construction guys. … They’re exploited with bad working conditions, and low pay, and they have to come up with a fee, and they have to stay underground for five or six years until the visa shows up.”

Last month, a federal judge ruled that the halt on protections for SIJS recipients was illegal. However, in the wake of that ruling it is unclear whether SIJS reviews have actually resumed or whether the Trump administration will appeal.

TPM reached out to the White House with several questions about the SIJS process including why the Trump administration began charging the fee and why they had directed judges to stop granting deferred deportation orders. We also asked whether SIJS reviews have resumed and whether the administration plans to appeal the judge’s ruling. The White House press office referred all questions to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which reviews applications for SIJS and deferred action. USCIS and DHS, which oversees that agency, did not respond to our request for comment,

Along with providing eligible youth with mentors, NYC 4 All is raising money to cover the SIJ fee for applicants. Overall, the organizer estimated the group has worked on about 100 SIJ cases. The Welcome Center, NSC, and other organizations with similar operations are also working to cover costs for applicants.

Most of the volunteers working with NYC 4 All and other similar groups that offer assistance to migrants have no formal legal training. Lou, a self-described “ex-finance guy” who lives in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, said he has been “deeply involved” in the group since early 2023. Lou focuses on helping people obtain work permits and SIJS.

“I was self-taught,” Lou said. “I’d just watch YouTube videos and figure out how to do it. It’s not that hard.”

While the volunteers say they have had little trouble learning the ropes of these processes, it’s another story for people who are unfamiliar with the system, do not speak English, and may not have resources for the fees or even a bank account.

“The logistics of it are just so fraught for them,” Lou said.

Multiple advocates who talked with me said legal organizations that provide pro bono aid to migrants are overwhelmed amid Trump’s mass deportation drive. That makes these volunteer efforts particularly critical. Advocates also said undocumented people can fall victim to predatory lawyers who charge exorbitant fees or abandon their clients.

“There’s a special place in hell for those people,” Lou said.

Lou stressed that while he can help with SIJS or obtaining an Employment Authorization Document, he recommends that anyone who has a complex case or is applying for asylum obtain a formal lawyer.

“I keep hammering people: get a freaking lawyer, get a lawyer, get a lawyer. Because I’m not that bright, man,” Lou said.

Overall, Lou estimated he spends about 15 hours a week working with NYC 4 All. Like many of the other volunteers there, Lou said he was motivated by the hardships faced by the migrants.

“They literally have nothing,” he said. “All they have is their character and their story.”

Back at the NSC clinic, during a rare quiet moment, Sirabella explained what motivated him to dive into the world of immigration advocacy and activism.

“I think part of what makes this country so great is this diversity. We’re a country of immigrants,” Sirabella said. “Also I was raised that … without the grace of God, that could just be me.”

Another man at the center of the action in the clinic was Ravi Ragbir, who is NSC’s executive director. Ragbir is a Trinidadian-American with long grey hair who has been through his own immigration odyssey.

He was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2001 and has since faced multiple deportation attempts, even after marrying a U.S. citizen. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Ragbir was detained by ICE as part of what he and his family believe was retaliation for his activism. In January, on his last full day in office, President Joe Biden gave Ragbir a pardon for the decades-old conviction.

Ragbir told TPM his own experience has inspired his work with New Sanctuary Coalition where they “believe no one should be deported, and welcome everyone.” Ragbir said he knows that he might be “a target” again, but is undeterred.

“Who is not worried about facing retaliation? The thing is, when people are afraid of retaliation … they have won,” he explained. “I’ve always been a target for many years. But we cannot allow that to hinder or to delay our work.”

Like most activists and advocates who spoke with me for this series, Ragbir believes the volume and vehemence of ICE activity in New York is due to ramp up due to rumblings from Trump’s “border czar” and concerns the president might be eager to feud with the city’s new progressive mayor, Zohran Mamdani. Sirabella agreed the situation for immigrants in New York will likely get worse.

“Trump is really good in terms of declaring out front what he plans to do and he follows through,” Sirabella said. “They’re firing judges who grant asylum too frequently and they’re putting [military Judge Advocate Generals] in for judges. I think it is gonna get worse.”

While Ragbir said he thinks the immigration system “has always been horrible,” he does see a major distinction with Trump.

Ione WellsSouth America correspondent, Santiago

Chile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven.

But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.

Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.

To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling.

However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.

In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an ""emergency government"" would not mean ""authoritarianism"".

Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama.

Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.

Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.

In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting.

In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.

Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.

His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.

The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela.

The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.

""Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,"" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign.

He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.

""What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,"" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.

He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced ""the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security"".

Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.

Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity.

Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.

He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an ""iron fist"" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.

But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult.

Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited.

Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.

For irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.

Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's ""very, very bad economic situation"".

He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request.

His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. ""I'm basically a ghost here,"" he says.

While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.

""Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,"" he said.

He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.

""It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.""

He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants.

With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business.

Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries.

He says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that ""the migrant workforce is very important"".

He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.

""Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,"" he adds.

Expelling unregistered workers ""will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,"" he warns.

Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.

""Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,"" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.

Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.

But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4ff5/live/949b2210-d9b8-11f0-b051-c9966e31459d.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:57:15.134084

Whether the boat strikes conducted thus far are assessed under international human rights law, the law of armed conflict, or the Department of Defense’s own policies, they have triggered an obligation on the United States to investigate them.","Operation Southern Spear, the U.S. campaign involving attacks on boats allegedly trafficking drugs from Venezuela, has so far killed 87 individuals. International law experts who have opined on the strikes overwhelmingly condemn them, on the basis that they either constitute violations of international human rights law (IHRL) or of the law of armed conflict (LOAC).

As we have previously explained, the strikes clearly violate the right to life under IHRL, which the United States is required to respect, including extraterritorially. The strikes are arbitrary deprivations of life – extrajudicial killings – because lethal force is deliberately being used against people who, in that moment, pose no immediate threat to the lives of others and who could be apprehended by non-lethal means. Even on the assumption that those killed were drug smugglers, killing them on the high seas is as unlawful as if the police started killing those suspected of dealing drugs on the streets of a U.S. city.

Because U.S. military units are organs of the State under the law of State responsibility (Articles of State Responsibility, art. 4), and because each of the strikes breaches the IHRL obligation to respect life, they constitute “internationally wrongful acts” for which the United States bears responsibility. Moreover, those involved may have committed murder in violation of the domestic criminal law of States that can exercise jurisdiction. (Murder under international criminal law is a different matter.) This includes the domestic law of the United States, as the State of nationality of the perpetrators, and potentially any States whose nationals were among the victims of the strikes.

Although this is the prevailing view among experts, widespread discussion persists over whether the strikes violate the law of armed conflict. Such discussions are counter-normative because that law applies only to actions during armed conflicts. The administration has erroneously asserted that it is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the cartels. That assertion is legally flawed (see, e.g., here, here, and here). To be clear, there is no armed conflict, and LOAC simply doesn’t apply.

Nevertheless, in light of the administration’s mistaken claims that an armed conflict is underway, international law experts have pointed out that the strikes would be unlawful even under LOAC because the individuals aboard the boats are not targetable under that law and the drugs are not military objectives. And in any event, the infamous Sept. 2 strike on the shipwrecked survivors would have been a clear violation of the LOAC prohibition on attacking those who are hors de combat, if LOAC applied (see, e.g., here and here).

Congress has begun demanding answers regarding the legality of the strikes generally, and the Sept. 2 attack specifically. We strongly support this exercise of legislative branch oversight. However, international law imposes its own obligations to investigate potential violations of both IHRL and LOAC. In this article, we explain those binding obligations. Our examination includes the source of the obligations, when they are required, and the criteria according to which they are conducted. In our view, the IHRL obligation to investigate has been triggered and, by the administration’s mischaracterization of the situation, so too would its LOAC counterpart. We close by noting that the Department of Defense’s own policies require an investigation into the operations, irrespective of whether the proper legal regime governing the strikes is IHRL or LOAC.

International Human Rights Law Investigations

State procedural duties to investigate potentially unlawful killings have long been recognized under IHRL as part of the State’s overarching positive obligation to protect the right to life. All human rights bodies take essentially the same approach to the parameters of this obligation. A useful summary can be found in the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment No. 36 (¶¶ 27-8 & 64), which sets out the Committee’s approach to interpreting Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the instrument’s provision on the right to life.

Similarly, an instructive summary of the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence on the procedural duty to investigate can be found in its case law guide (pages 35-51) for Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the right to life.

The law of human rights bodies on the procedural duty to investigate unlawful killings is rich and varied, dealing with many different types of situations, including armed conflict. More importantly, that law is clear and unambiguous, and its overall correctness is not open to doubt.

The following principles can be distilled from this body of law.

First, the duty to investigate arises when State authorities “know or should have known of potentially unlawful deprivations of life” (General Comment 36, ¶ 27) (emphasis added). That requirement is clearly met regarding the boat strikes – the State itself is doing them. The fact that the President and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Legal Counsel (OLC) by fiat declared them to be lawful does not make them any less unlawful, let alone potentially so. That’s even more the case if the OLC relied on presidential determinations of a NIAC and other matters (as indicated by reporting), rather than engaging in independent legal assessment of those issues.

Second, investigations “must be aimed at ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice, at promoting accountability and preventing impunity, at avoiding denial of justice and at drawing necessary lessons for revising practices and policies with a view to avoiding repeated violations. Investigations should explore, inter alia, the legal responsibility of superior officials with regard to violations of the right to life committed by their subordinates.” (id.) The issue of superior responsibility, discussed below, looms especially large in these strikes in light of the Secretary of Defense’s personal involvement in them. So does the need to revise practices and policies, which Hegseth suggested never occurred after the shipwreck strike.

Third, it is not sufficient for States to investigate unlawful deprivations of life “merely through administrative or disciplinary measures, and a criminal investigation is normally required, which should lead, if enough incriminating evidence is gathered, to a criminal prosecution.” (id.) Measures short of a criminal investigation might be appropriate for personnel on the operational periphery of the strikes, but certainly not for those who played a direct role in planning, approving, or executing them.

Fourth, “[i]mmunities and amnesties provided to perpetrators of intentional killings and to their superiors, and comparable measures leading to de facto or de jure impunity, are, as a rule, incompatible with the duty to respect and ensure the right to life, and to provide victims with an effective remedy.” (id.) The presumption against immunity and amnesties is especially significant in light of President Trump’s excessive pardon practices.

Fifth, investigations “must always be independent, impartial, prompt, thorough, effective, credible and transparent .… States parties need to take, among other things, appropriate measures to establish the truth relating to the events leading to the deprivation of life, including the reasons and legal basis for targeting certain individuals and the procedures employed by State forces before, during and after the time at which the deprivation occurred.” (General Comment 36, ¶ 28).

Sixth, these duties apply even extraterritorially and in situations of armed conflict, in parallel with similar duties under LOAC, which are discussed below. For instance, this year the European Court of Human Rights found Russia responsible for failing to effectively investigate the role of its authorities in the downing of the MH17 airliner over Ukraine in 2014 (see more here). Of course, the context of an armed conflict may require some flexibility in applying criteria, such as thoroughness and effectiveness, to account for what is realistically feasible under the circumstances (General Comment 36, ¶ 64, and ECHR cases such as Al-Skeini v. UK, Jaloud v. Netherlands, Hanan v. Germany, and Georgia v. Russia No. 2, all discussed in the case law guide, page 47).

It is important to note that no extenuating circumstances would apply to an investigation into the boat strikes. Not only were those strikes not conducted in the course of an armed conflict, as we have explained, but all relevant information and evidence regarding them is in the possession of U.S. authorities. What is crucial at the moment is securing such evidence.

Taken together, these points lead to an inexorable conclusion: the United States has a positive duty under IHRL to investigate the lethal strikes against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean. That duty can be discharged only if the investigation is independent, meaning that the State organs conducting the investigation must be free from undue influence from those they are investigating. Moreover, while Congressional oversight is welcome, the positive duty can only be discharged through a criminal investigation by the armed forces or the Department of Justice, as appropriate. A perfunctory administrative investigation within the Pentagon would clearly not suffice, and any interference in the investigations would be unlawful under IHRL.

Law of Armed Conflict Investigations

As noted, it is clear that the U.S. strikes against the alleged drug traffickers are not occurring in the context of a non-international armed conflict. However, as the administration claims they are, by its logic, the United States would be bound by any obligation to conduct investigations into LOAC violations amounting to war crimes during such conflicts. Moreover, with the administration threatening to conduct operations directly against Venezuela, the obligation to investigate LOAC violations during an international armed conflict, which those operations would trigger, merits attention.

The law of armed conflict imposes a two-tiered obligation to investigate possible war crimes. The obligation derives primarily from the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. Note that since they are considered to reflect customary international law (Nuclear Weapons, para. 79), Geneva Convention obligations are binding on all States. That States shoulder a customary law obligation to investigate possible war crimes is simply beyond dispute (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 158 and accompanying practice; UNGA Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, prin. I). Indeed, as noted in the DoD Law of War Manual (§ 18.13)

The duties to implement and enforce the law of war also imply duties to investigate reports of alleged violations of the law of war. In addition to taking measures to meet the requirements of DoD policy, commanders may also take other measures they deem appropriate to ensure appropriate investigation and reporting of alleged violations of the law of war within their command. (see also U.S. Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, § 6.2.6).

The first tier involves the duty to investigate potential “grave breaches,” which are set forth in the Geneva Conventions (GC I, arts. 49 & 50; GC II, art. 50 & 51; GC III, arts. 129 & 130; GC IV, arts. 146 & 147; see also AP I, arts. 11 & 85). Willful killing of protected persons, which includes civilians and those who are hors de combat (like shipwrecked persons), is one of the enumerated grave breaches.

These provisions require States to pursue prosecution of those suspected of committing grave breaches by: 1) enacting domestic legislation enabling prosecution of offenders; 2) searching for those accused of violating the Conventions; and 3) either prosecuting them or turning them over to another State that is willing to do so (aut dedere aut punire). The requirement to “search” for the accused has long been interpreted as mandating an investigation into a possible grave breach to determine whether to prosecute or to turn the accused over to another State.

Importantly, the grave breaches provisions apply only during an international armed conflict, which the current situation is not, even according to the administration’s mischaracterization of the situation. However, should the United States attack Venezuela, thereby initiating an international armed conflict, these obligations would be triggered. A failure by the United States to satisfy them would constitute an internationally wrongful act.

The second tier of the investigations requirement, and of immediate relevance to the boat strikes on the administration’s own theory that a non-international armed conflict exists, is based on the obligation to “take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present convention other than the grave breaches.” It appears in the same provisions that set out the requirement for investigating grave breaches. The duty to suppress does not encompass a duty to prosecute or send an offender to another State for prosecution, but necessarily implies a duty to investigate in order to determine whether a violation has occurred, take appropriate disciplinary measures against any offender, and assess whether action can be taken to prevent further violations by others.

What is different is that the suppression obligation applies to violations of all of the Conventions’ rules, including Common Article 3. That article, which appears verbatim in all four Conventions, prohibits “violence to life and person” directed at “persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including those placed ‘hors de combat.’” And unlike most other Geneva Convention articles, Common Article 3 sets forth fundamental rules for non-international armed conflict, violations of which have been criminalized in U.S. law (18 USC 2441(c)(3)). The resulting treaty-based duty to investigate and prosecute potential war crimes, even with respect to non-international armed conflicts, undeniably reflects customary international law (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 158, and accompanying practice). Therefore, the consequence of the administration’s assertion that it is involved in such a conflict is, by its own flawed analysis, that the “suppression” obligation attaches not only to any violations that might occur during operations in Venezuela that trigger an international armed conflict, but also to the strikes on the boats against the cartels.

There are several non-exhaustive principles regarding such investigations that can be identified by examining these and related rules, such as Article 87 of Additional Protocol I (which does not bind the United States), and the practice of States in applying them (see Investigations Study).

First, the legal obligation under LOAC to report possible violations applies to all individuals who exercise command authority over military forces, although “[e]ffective compliance with the requirement necessitates policies extending it to any member of the armed forces with knowledge of a possible … violation” (Study, page 79).

Second, every credible allegation of a war crime must be investigated promptly. In the absence of an allegation, an investigation is required whenever there is a credible reason to suspect a violation has occurred (id.).

Third, the duty to investigate can be “satisfied by investigations at any level of command, but only so long as the investigation in question is effective in terms of uncovering relevant facts and circumstances that will permit appropriate disciplinary or punitive action to be taken” (id.).

Fourth, the investigations must be impartial and independent. This does not necessarily mean that investigators must be outside the chain of command, unlike investigative duties under IHRL, so long as their work is effective in ascertaining the facts. However, any attempt to interfere with the investigation is strictly prohibited. Moreover, commanders and other responsible officers may not order and oversee investigations into incidents involving themselves; instead, they must refer them to a higher command or a law enforcement organization. (Study, page 80, para. 10).

Fifth, in the event “clear and reliable evidence of a war crime” surfaces, States are required to prosecute those who have committed war crimes and take appropriate disciplinary or remedial measures for violations that do not amount to war crimes. (Study, page 81).

And sixth, investigations need not be conducted, as a matter of law, publicly or their findings released. That said, in many situations in which the possibility of a war crime has become public, as in this case, doing so is generally sound policy. (id.)

Given the widespread publicity over the boat attacks, especially the Sept. 2 strike on the shipwrecked survivors, as well as the extensive analysis by international law experts, there are obviously credible allegations of war crimes, assuming the administration’s framing of the situation as a non-international armed conflict is correct. Of course, it is not, as we have explained – war crimes cannot be committed in the absence of an armed conflict. But, given its position on the existence of such a conflict, the administration has no alternative but to launch a prompt, impartial, and independent investigation to comply with the LOAC requirement that applies in such conflicts.

It is crucial to bear in mind that in both international and non-international armed conflict, commanders and other superiors can be held criminally responsible for the war crimes of their subordinates if they knew, or had reason to know, that war crimes were being committed, or about to be committed, by them and failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the war crimes or to punish those responsible for crimes that had already been committed (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 153 and accompanying practice). Ordering investigations is an effective step in prosecuting offenders and in identifying measures that need to be taken to prevent future war crimes. Based on publicly available information, the Defense Secretary’s apparent failure to change policies following the Sept. 2 double-tap strike is highly relevant in any assessment of compliance with these obligations.

Should a commander or other superior fail to order an investigation when doing so is called for in the circumstances, that individual might be subject to prosecution for the underlying war crime on the basis of command (superior) responsibility. This is true both with regard to military personnel throughout the chain of command and civilian superiors such as the Secretary of Defense (DoD Law of War Manual, § 18.23.3.2). In this regard, it merits emphasis that war crimes are subject to universal jurisdiction, that is, offenders may be prosecuted by any State, even when there is no relationship between the war crime and the State engaging in the prosecution. Additionally, commanders who fail to comply with the obligation to investigate and take other measures to suppress LOAC violations may be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for dereliction of duty or violation of orders (§ 18.23.3.1).

Finally, we remind readers that IHRL continues to apply during armed conflict, albeit with due regard for military realities. There are none in this case that would meaningfully impede an investigation in full compliance with the aforementioned IHRL criteria. Indeed, as a matter of law, IHRL is the only appropriate framework for the investigations, unless the United States carries out the administration’s threats to take military action against Venezuela itself.

DoD Implementation of the Investigation Requirements under IHRL and LOAC

The United States has implemented the obligation to investigate in DoD Directive 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program (see also, DoD Law of War Manual, § 18.13). It provides that “[a]ll military and U.S. civilian employees, contractor personnel, and subcontractors assigned to or accompanying a DoD Component must report through their chain of command all reportable incidents” (¶ 4.1). A reportable incident is (page GL-15):

An incident that a unit commander or other responsible official determines, based on credible information, potentially involves: a war crime; other violations of the law of war; or conduct during military operations that would be a war crime if the military operations occurred in the context of an armed conflict. The unit commander or responsible official need not determine that a potential violation occurred; they need only find that credible information warrants further review of the incident. (emphasis added)

Importantly, even if an incident occurs outside armed conflict, as in these strikes, the reporting requirement still applies.

The commander of any unit who receives a report “about an alleged violation of the law of war must assess whether the allegation is based on credible information and thus constitutes a reportable incident.” (¶ 4.2). Information is credible when “a reasonable military commander would believe [it] to be sufficiently accurate to warrant further review of an alleged violation.” Note that “[t]he unit commander or responsible official need not determine a potential violation occurred, only that credible information merits further review of the incident.” Among the examples of “incidents that must be reported,” the U.S. Navy’s Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations includes the following: “Offenses against … Survivors of Sunken Ships;” “When military interests permit, failure to search out, collect, make provision for the safety of, or to care for survivors of sunken ships;” “Attacks on individual civilians;” and proportionality violations (§ 6.3).

If a report is credible, the commander concerned has to direct a “properly scoped” assessment, investigation, inquiry, or other review that is deconflicted with any ongoing criminal investigation. Even if there is a criminal investigation, the commander would still want to determine the facts, as they may require measures to avoid repetition, such as changing the Rules of Engagement. Should no such investigation be underway, the commander is obligated to “refer information about alleged war crimes to, or request an investigation by, a responsible Defense Criminal Investigative Organization” (DoD Law of War Program, ¶ 4.2).

Even if the unit commander concludes that there is no credible information to support an allegation, that commander is nevertheless obligated to forward this determination through the chain of command to the appropriate Combatant Commander. In the case of the boat strikes and any attack on Venezuela, it would likely be the Commander of U.S. Southern Command, although the involvement of Special Operations Command complicates matters. In any event, the responsible Combatant Commander must then assess the decision and forward all reportable incidents to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and applicable Service Secretaries (¶ 4.3).

There is no question that boat strikes are reportable incidents that, based on credible information, should lead a reasonable commander to conclude there may have been a war crime, especially in light of the Navy’s own guidance on the type of incidents that qualify. If an armed conflict were underway, as the administration claims, it would raise serious questions about targeting individuals who are neither members of an organized armed group nor directly participating in the hostilities. Even if those killed in the attack were reasonably believed to be targetable in the circumstances, the prohibition on attacking those who are shipwrecked, one of the most fundamental rules in the law of naval warfare, was undeniably implicated. There are also problematic proportionality and precautions in attack issues. The intense controversy that the reports of the strike have sparked is a testament to the extent to which the entire campaign raises questions of both State responsibility for LOAC violations on the part of the United States and possible war crimes by some of those involved (see, esp. here).

Importantly, even though the strikes are not occurring during armed conflict (contrary to the administration’s claims), they still have to be reported and investigated. Recall that reportable incidents include incidents outside of armed conflict if the conduct would be a war crime during armed conflict. That is very clearly the case here. Simply put, it would be unsupportable to argue that the incident did not fall within the four corners of the “reportable incident” standard.

Concluding Thoughts

All of this leads to a relatively straightforward conclusion. Whether the boat strikes conducted thus far are assessed under international human rights law, the law of armed conflict, or the Department of Defense’s own policies, they have triggered an obligation on the United States to investigate them. That obligation is obligatory, not discretionary, and it is not satisfied by the administration’s claims to be acting lawfully or by congressional hearings. International law is clear. The boat strikes, and any questionable operations that may occur in the future, necessitate prompt, impartial, and effective investigations capable of gathering the facts and identifying those responsible. The fact that the United States controls the factual record of the incidents heightens the imperative to act promptly.

We are, however, not naïve. In the current political context, it is doubtful that across-the-board investigations into the boat strikes will occur. If any investigation is ordered, we anticipate it will be limited to the Sept. 2 second strike incident that has drawn so much attention. But this does not mean that the United States is not under a legal obligation to conduct one or more broader investigations into all of the strikes in accordance with its international obligations. The impunity resulting from a failure to do so is one we have seen at least once before – when the use of torture by U.S. officials in the “war on terror” went largely unpunished. A clear line connects that episode of impunity with the ongoing situation, in which uniformed and civilian government lawyers have no real choice but to carry out their legal and ethical duties.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The_Pentagon_January_2008-1024x585.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:57:19.494290

The shooting contained a particularly American wrinkle. For at least two Brown students, it was their second school shooting.

It’s surreal already having to have done this once. This is the second time.

natalie kitroeff

Back in 2019, Mia Tretta was shot in her stomach by a school shooter when she was a freshman in high school in Santa Clarita, California. On Saturday night, Tretta, now a junior at Brown, was studying in her dorm room when she learned that the same thing was happening all over again, this time at her college.

But we got what felt like hundreds of texts saying that there is an active shooter. Stay inside. Stay where you are. Run, hide, fight.

natalie kitroeff

As Tretta told my co-host, Rachel Abrams, she had chosen to attend Brown because she felt a sense of safety on its campus.

And my whole sense of safety, and innocence, and childhood was taken away on November 14 of 2019 at Saugus High School. And trying to reclaim any of that back, I felt like I could do that at Brown. And now it’s just been taken away again.

That’s all we for now about both of these shootings. We’ll keep you posted as we learn more.

Today, as Democrats debate how to counter President Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration and try to win back voters with their own vision, we look back at why former President Biden let the border get so out of control in the first place and how he underestimated just how much the problem would come to define his presidency. My colleague, Chris Flavelle, takes us into his investigation of how Biden fumbled the issue of immigration and what his party can learn from his missteps.

It’s Monday, December 15.

Chris, you’ve spent much of this fall taking a forensic look back at what many consider to be one of the Biden administration’s biggest failures, its immigration policy. Under Biden, immigration at the border surged to record numbers. Many say it cost Democrats the election in 2024 and set the stage for the immigration crackdown that we’re in the middle of right now. I want to just start by asking, why look back on that policy in this moment, a year after Biden left office?

chris flavelle

So this moment looks a whole lot like 2020, right? You’ve got President Trump in the White House enacting really aggressive strategies in terms of arrests and deportations of migrants. You’ve got really, really strong anger from Democrats and others in response to those policies. And you’ve got Democrats as a party trying to figure out what position to take. That’s exactly what was happening in 2020 as Joe Biden was first campaigning for the presidency and then deciding after winning what to do as president.

He responded to those same pressures by charting a really aggressive counter campaign, being the anti-Trump. And we saw, with the benefit of hindsight, what the result was, huge surge in border encounters, massive shift in public opinion against Democrats, and, ultimately, Donald Trump returning to the White House again on a campaign against migrants and an open border. So I think the question of why did things go so badly and what did Democrats learn is actually really relevant right now and is very timely, because that question of what does the party stand for and what do Americans want for the border and immigration remains fundamentally unresolved.

So that’s why I went back and spent months looking at this question of why did Biden and his close aides make the decisions they did. And what I found was, surprisingly, a lot of those mistakes and blowback was preordained and warned, and they did it anyway.

natalie kitroeff

Preordained how? What do you mean by that?

chris flavelle

So let’s go back to the summer of 2020. You’re now approaching the height of the campaign. Joe Biden is seeking the presidency on a platform of being much more welcoming towards immigrants. As this is happening, I learned, some of his advisors began circulating a memo with a really important warning.

This memo, which we got a copy of, said that, combined with everything else that was going on, the pent up demand for migration under Trump, the economic devastation from COVID, on top of that, Mr. Biden’s own promises and his more welcoming tone, they warned, could produce a really serious surge in border crossings. And reading that language today, it’s remarkable how on the nose it was.

That memo said, quote, “At the US border, a potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities, and imperil the agenda of the new administration.” These warnings did not go over well with Biden’s campaign team. But these advisors kept on raising this through the ranks of the organization until, finally, after Biden had won election, he got a briefing from the people who worked on this memo.

And I’m told during that briefing that the president-elect and Kamala Harris, the vice President-elect, seemed to grasp that this was a problem, but they wound up ignoring those recommendations to change course.

natalie kitroeff

Just so I make sure I understand this, you’re saying that very early on, even before Biden won, there were advisors who wrote this memo who eventually carried out this briefing warning about the perils of immediately doing everything he said he would during the campaign, but Biden and Harris ignored them. Explain why.

chris flavelle

Yeah, look, the why is epic, right? The first part of the why is politics. It’s worth remembering what the mood was in 2020. This was the height of Black Lives Matter. This was a moment in American history when there was a real belief, especially among Democrats, that there was a racial reckoning underway.

And it seems as though the political calculus was they couldn’t turn their back on that. They couldn’t, in that atmosphere, decide they would get a little more aggressive on border enforcement. That’s the external why. The internal why, the staffing choices in the Biden administration early on reflected this idea that it was both politically sound and morally necessary to focus on how to help asylum seekers and not to focus as much on enforcing the border.

natalie kitroeff

So that’s the pressure he’s facing. But what does Biden himself think of this issue?

chris flavelle

One of the really strong through lines from almost all of my interviews with more than 30 people who worked in the administration on border and migration issues is that none of them felt like they really understood what Biden’s own views were. In fact, they weren’t sure he held strong, clear views and positions on immigration and the border. There were a few things he clearly cared about. One was he didn’t want to see kids held in these difficult conditions at border patrol stations. He didn’t want to be seen as doing anything like what Trump had done in terms of forcing migrants to remain in Mexico while they were waiting for their claims to be heard.

But beyond that, one of the strongest criticisms I heard was that Biden, as President, did not set broad strategic goals. There was a sense that he just didn’t like talking about this issue. One person told me that Biden’s body language changed. You could tell he was uncomfortable when he was talking about migration.

natalie kitroeff

Fascinating. He was physically uncomfortable talking about it. But it sounds to the extent that he was thinking about the issue, he does have sympathy with the side that believes there’s a moral imperative to reversing the signature pieces of Trump’s immigration crackdown. And we know that, once in office, that’s exactly what Biden does. So describe that. Describe what happened.

chris flavelle

Yeah, Joe Biden, the first day he was in the White House, made good on what he had promised to do during the campaign. He reversed almost all of Trump’s signature policies. He said he would stop building the wall. He dramatically reduced the scope of arrests inside the country for migrants.

He ended, or tried to end, what they called the Remain in Mexico Policy, forcing migrants to wait while their cases were heard. He stopped sending kids back over the border under the public health rules for COVID. And he announced that he would put a halt on deportations for 100 days.

natalie kitroeff

Right. And what followed from signaling a more welcoming stance toward migrants was, in fact, a huge surge at the border.

chris flavelle

Yeah, it was a disaster almost immediately.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

You could look at this as the first of a series of major miscalculations that the Biden team made on immigration, failing to anticipate the scale of the numbers of the people who were coming. During the campaign and the transition, as they prepared for these scenarios, they said, let’s plan around the idea that the number of people crossing the border once Biden is in office will equal the worst year or the worst month under Trump, and then just stay there.

And the reaction to that proposal was, well, it could never get that bad. And sure enough, by March of Biden’s first year in office, they had blown past the worst month of the first Trump administration. And then not only did it stay at those levels, it kept on rising. So even the people whose job was to think, well, how bad could it be turned out to be incredibly mistaken. They just didn’t imagine the geographic and numerical scale of migrants who would try to reach the border.

natalie kitroeff

And when it becomes clear just how bad it is, what’s Biden’s response to the chaos?

chris flavelle

Biden and his team were focused on responding to the immediate crisis of children who were stuck in border patrol stations that were not designed for them. And so their emphasis, their goal in the moment, was to find something to do with these children, to move them somewhere safe that made sense for them. It was a real situation of trying to react to events and just mitigate the damage. But there was no overarching vision of, well, what should the US do on the border and securing the border?

natalie kitroeff

You’re describing a paralysis from the White House. No real policymaking vision from the top. I have to ask, who is driving the car on this? If it’s not Biden, then who’s making the calls?

chris flavelle

One of the themes from my reporting was nobody was driving the bus.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Over and over again, people who worked in this told me that part of the reason for the policymaking paralysis was there was, during the early period, no single person who was specifically assigned responsibility to figure out and implement policy on the border and immigration. In the absence of that, you had different factions that had different views. You had people inside the White House who came from the world of immigration advocacy generally more favorable to migrants and asylum seekers.

You had people who came to this from more of a national security mindset. And they tended to emphasize enforcement of the border. And they couldn’t agree. And above all of that, you had this inner circle around the president that really thought, you know what? There’s no win here. We’re not going to get points for talking about this. Let’s just not talk about it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

I remember I was covering these issues at the time from Mexico City. And it was stark how the White House didn’t want to speak to this, as you say, but everyone else, regular people, were talking about it. They were concerned about what was going on.

chris flavelle

Yeah. And look, to the degree that there was a logic here, I’m told that the logic was if we just don’t talk about it, maybe it’ll resolve on its own. And the first time I heard that from someone who’d been involved in these conversations, I thought, that’s clearly crazy.

But there was some rationale behind it because that had happened in the past. Border surges in 2014 when Biden was vice president in the Obama administration. Surges under the first Trump administration. The border numbers had eventually subsided, and public attention had moved on. And they hoped the same would happen again, but they were wrong. These numbers did not fade. Instead, the surge kept on getting worse and worse.

natalie kitroeff

OK, so the White House wants to be silent on this. They don’t want to touch the issue. Remind us, what’s the reaction among Americans, among regular people, to the waves of migrants that are now coming in?

chris flavelle

Yeah, the polling data shows a real shift. And that shift goes in the opposite direction. It shows that more Americans are becoming worried about illegal immigration, and the support for migrants is falling, seemingly in response to this perception of chaos at the border. And now you would think that that polling data would be a red flag, but it wasn’t because of still more political miscalculations.

The administration, the people around Biden, were worried that if they got more aggressive on the border on enforcement, they risked alienating Latino voters who were an important part of the coalition that brought Biden to the White House. And beyond that, they figured that other American voters just wouldn’t care that much. They thought that unless you live in a border state, this wouldn’t be a real priority for you.

And sure enough, that situation didn’t last because, eventually, Texas found a way to make it a problem for the rest of the country. In April of 2022, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas figures out how to blow up this idea that Biden could ignore the border by starting a campaign to actually bus migrants from Texas to Washington, DC, and effectively say to Biden and the Democrats, you cannot ignore this. We won’t let you.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

We’ll be right back.

Describe this campaign, Chris, led by Governor Abbott, to bring this problem directly to Democrats’ doorsteps and, as you said, make it impossible to ignore. Remind us how that all played out.

chris flavelle

The campaign started with one bus.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

In April of 2022, there was a bus that arrived from Texas to Washington, DC. It pulled up near the US Capitol. And we know from data we got from a public records request that bus was carrying 12 Venezuelans, four Colombians, four Cubans, and four Nicaraguans. And it was the start of what became tens of thousands of migrants from Texas moved by bus over months and years to New York and Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, eventually Denver.

And the result was really remarkable. You had, all of a sudden, mayors and governors in democratically-held areas saying, whoa, this is a problem for us. This is a problem financially. We’ve got to pay to find hotel rooms and shelters for these people. We’ve got a political problem. Our voters don’t like seeing this surge of people on the streets.

Publicly, the Biden White House is saying, come on, this is a stunt. You’re using migrants as props. This is despicable. That was the public response. But internally, this campaign by Abbott was described to me as a turning point where people who worked for the administration began to think, you know what? We actually have lost this debate. This is the moment at which people are going to turn on us. And it pushed the White House to at least say, OK, well, we can’t do nothing. What are we going to do?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

And what do they do now that they’ve finally started to wake up to this?

chris flavelle

Yeah, so in this year, 2023, the third year that Biden is President, this administration tried two big swings to reduce the sense of chaos at the border. One of them was a program to take people from a handful of countries, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela, that had made up a big share of border crossers, and say, you know what? Instead of rushing the border, we’ll just let you in.

We’ll have a program that’s formal. You can apply, you can pass a background check, and you can fly into the country. That will reduce pressure at the border. That was their first idea. And then second, they said, people who want to cross the border still, OK, here’s an app, CBP1. And you have to wait and make an appointment.

Both those programs were intended to control the flow and reduce the sense of chaos. But by the one metric that mattered most, which was border crossings and border encounters, none of this worked. The numbers from that final few months of 2023 are incredibly clear. The border crossings had by this point tripled since Biden took office. They were reaching a quarter of a million people per month, just totally without any kind of precedent. And that’s when the Biden administration finally realized they had to get much more serious and much more aggressive.

natalie kitroeff

And what does that look like, getting more serious and more aggressive?

chris flavelle

It’s a few things. First of all, they decided to get on board with Senate talks that had begun a few months earlier, trying to look for a bipartisan deal to give the White House authority to effectively close the border to asylum applications. Also, at the very end of December, senior Biden officials flew down to Mexico City to meet with their Mexican counterparts and deliver a really tough message to Mexico, saying, we need you to close your own Southern border because that’s the only way we’re going to reduce the number of people getting to the US border.

And that worked. The Mexicans took action and, in response to that pressure, really aggressively cracked down on their own border. And you see that in the numbers. In January of 2024, Biden’s last year in office, those numbers had fallen, but not nearly enough. They were still facing much higher crossings than when Biden first came to office. And this is where the pressure gets even more intense, because in February of 2024, that border bill that was moving through the Senate collapses when President Trump, then candidate Trump, tells Republicans to vote against it.

So all of a sudden, Biden faces a real dilemma. And the election is less than a year away. That’s when they begin looking at what you think of as the nuclear option, which is finally using the power that Biden had, unilaterally, of his own authority, to effectively close the border to asylum applications, which he did in June of that year. And the thing that was amazing was it basically worked. The numbers plummeted almost right away. And so from a policy perspective, he had basically solved the problem.

natalie kitroeff

Yeah. Chris, help me understand this. I had this question at the time. I have this question now. Why did it take him so long to use executive action to do this?

chris flavelle

You ask 20 people, you get 20 answers, right? One answer that I got was they just didn’t believe it was right. This was not in keeping with Democrats’ principles about respecting the dignity of migrants. They want to respect the law. They couldn’t do it and wouldn’t until they felt they had to.

Another argument is they wanted to give Congress every possible chance to do this on their own, and only when it was crystal clear Congress wouldn’t do it. Only then would Biden do this himself. Whatever it was, I think, in hindsight, what’s clear is it didn’t work. They waited too long to get any meaningful benefit from doing this.

natalie kitroeff

Explain that. Where are voters on this? Why didn’t it work? Why didn’t it convince people that they were on the right track?

chris flavelle

Yeah, there’s two ways of thinking about why it didn’t work. One is just the calendar was so unforgiving, right? At this point, you’re five months away from Election Day. Voters, to the extent they’ve been paying attention, have lived through 3 and 1/2 years almost of border crisis. So that idea, that perception that Biden and Democrats favor open borders, is really cemented by this point.

But the other argument is, even after taking this step, they wouldn’t brag about it. They did not go out and say, look what we did. And I’m told by senior Democrats, that view persisted. That view of if we’re talking about immigration and talking about the border, they’re losing. And so they decided not to focus on it. Even at the end, once they had effectively solved the problem, that inherent foundational skittishness remained.

natalie kitroeff

I want to just talk about everything you’ve told us. It is really hard to overstate the significance of it, the significance of the fallout of Biden’s miscalculations on immigration. Obviously, it led to Trump’s return to office in part, and that has totally transformed the country. But there is this potentially deeper, longer-lasting impact that you point to in your reporting, which is that it actually helped lead to this rightward shift in the American public’s views of immigration. Can you describe that for me? And just help me understand how durable you think that shift is.

chris flavelle

The honest answer, of course, is no one knows how durable that shift is. There is polling data that has come in since Donald Trump came back to the White House, showing that some of the intense unease about immigration that really spiked by the end of the Biden years. That unease has softened a bit, and those numbers have receded to the pre-Biden levels.

But what that doesn’t account for is, anecdotally and based on conversations with people who work in this, there seems to be a real sense of lingering anger among American voters, Democrats, Republicans, the sense that people remain collectively a little bit scarred by what they saw when Biden was president.

natalie kitroeff

The question you’re pushing on is, are Democrats going to swing the pendulum back to more permissive immigration policies now that there is a backlash against Trump? Or are they going to look back at what Biden did and say, look, these are mistakes that we don’t want to repeat? And you talk to these folks. Do you have any clarity on that?

chris flavelle

I see no evidence from the reporting I did that Democrats have answered that question. I don’t get the sense that they have figured out what the lessons are from the Biden years and what they should say on immigration going forward. And I think the challenge that Democrats face is actually the same challenge facing Republicans, which is being squeezed between two extremes, right? We know that the Trump style approach of extremely aggressive crackdowns can work at reducing border crossings, and it can satisfy some portion of Americans.

But there’s a real pushback, right? It sure seems like many American voters are uneasy about the severity of the Trump approach. On the other hand, as we saw in the last four years, a lot of Americans are uneasy with the perception of open borders. And the challenge for moderate Democrats or moderate Republicans will be trying to find a third approach. But even if they can figure out what that is from a policy perspective, can they get American voters to accept it?

And maybe the room for new ideas, something closer to a more welcoming approach, is, for the foreseeable future, closed politically because of that lingering anger from the Biden years. And so maybe the real legacy of Joe Biden on immigration is that people’s willingness to give immigrants the benefit of the doubt, or even give Democrats the benefit of the doubt, is, at least for now, gone.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

Well, Chris, thank you.

chris flavelle

Thank you.

natalie kitroeff

We’ll be right back.

Here’s what else you need to today. Syrian and American officials confirmed that a gunman who killed two US Army soldiers and an American interpreter on Saturday was a member of Syria’s security forces who was set to be dismissed for his extremist views. The attack, which officials said was carried out by ISIS, claimed the first US casualties in Syria since the country’s strongman leader, Bashar al-Assad, was ousted from power a year ago. President Trump has vowed to retaliate.

Iranian man says ICE detention in NM is unlawful

In U.S. legally since 2024, Hamid Ziaei was jailed in June without explanation

In 2024, Hamid Ziaei came from Iran to the U.S. and was detained.Soon after, an immigration judge said that because Ziaei would likely face persecution if he returned to Iran, he could stay here under certain conditions, and he settled into a life in San Diego, an Innovation Law Lab news release said.In a regularly scheduled check-in in June, the judge's decision was ignored, and Ziaei was held without explanation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and taken to the Torrance County Detention Facility in New Mexico.On Monday, Dec. 15, Ziaei and legal counsel will be in federal court in Albuquerque with a habeas corpus petition asserting that he has been detained unlawfully. Tiffany Wang, a fellow attorney at Innovation Law Lab — which is representing Ziaei — said the best outcome would be an immediate decision allowing him to return to his home in California. The judge could also want more time to decide, or could consider having Ziaei deported to another country. No such country has been named, and returning him to Iran is not allowed, Wang said.""I think it's important to understand that so many people just like Hamid have been building lives in the U.S., contributing, and have been indiscriminately swept away by ICE, shipped hundreds of miles away from the communities and everything they were doing,"" Wang said. ""There are procedures that ICE must follow, and they have completely thrown those out the window. And we're fighting against that."".

Her legal team initially attempted to have the case thrown out, t arguing that Dugan is covered by judicial immunity.","A federal jury will begin hearing the case against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Hannah Dugan, 66, on Monday in a lawsuit that has drawn national attention, weighing how far the Trump administration can go in squashing resistance to its nationwide crackdown on immigrants.

The case revolves around events in April, when Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant who had been charged with battery, appeared in Dugan’s courtroom. Federal agents also arrived at the courtroom that day, seeking Flores-Ruiz, whom they said entered the country illegally over a decade ago.

Dugan confronted the federal agents as they waited outside her courtroom. Later, she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out of her courtroom through a side door which led into the same hallway where the federal agents were waiting. Flores-Ruiz was followed into the elevator and outside by the agents, who chased and then arrested him.

Days later, Dugan was arrested and handcuffed by FBI agents and charged with obstruction and concealing an individual. FBI Director Kash Patel posted photographs of Dugan in handcuffs and celebrated her arrest, writing on X, “No one is above the law.”

In early April, prior to Flores-Ruiz, ICE arrested two other people at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Officials expressed concerns that the arrests were causing defendants, witnesses and victims to avoid coming to court or cooperating with law enforcement.

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley objected to what he characterized as intimidation tactics in enforcing its immigration crackdown and wielding the power of the state against “anyone who opposes these policies.” In a statement, Crowley said, “we have an obligation to administer our courts in a safe, efficient manner that delivers due process for anyone.”

Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, said that the Trump officials “basically want to be unleashed to do whatever they want to commit these raids in courtrooms across the country.” Milwaukee-area Democratic Sens. Chris Larson and Tim Carpenter and Reps. Christine Sinicki, Darrin Madison, Supreme Moore Omokunde, Angelito Tenorio, and Sequanna Taylor issued a joint statement calling the county courthouse “a sanctuary for justice and peace where the accused come forward willingly in a fair an unbiased process”, and warned that “arresting people out of a courtroom will lead to a breakdown of civil society.”

At the end of April, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan with pay. Her case catalyzed protests outside the Milwaukee FBI Office, and was repeatedly mentioned at the summer’s No Kings protests. In July, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to withhold pay for suspended judges.

“In these rare circumstances, these judges’ actions and alleged misconduct rose to such a level that suspension was warranted,” the bill’s authors, Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee), Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) and Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) wrote in a memo. “Simply put, Wisconsin taxpayers must be protected from the misconduct and/or commission of a crime by rogue judges.”

If convicted, Dugan, who has pleaded not guilty, faces six years in prison. Her legal team initially attempted to have the case thrown out, t arguing that Dugan is covered by judicial immunity. That argument was rejected by U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, who wrote that judges have civil immunity for official actions, but not criminal immunity, and that the case should go forward.

“As she said after her unnecessary arrest, Judge Dugan asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court,” Dugan’s defense attorneys said in a statement.

On Thursday night, a crowd gathered outside the federal courthouse to support Dugan.

Therese Heeg, 66, told the Wisconsin Examiner that she felt a responsibility to attend the rally to “protect our democracy for my children, my grandchildren, my son-in-law who’s unable to live in the U.S. because he’s from Africa, my best friend’s children who are Hispanic who are afraid for their lives, even though they’re citizens.” Heeg said she’s worried about immigration enforcement coming to the city to take people away. “Every single day there’s more and more atrocities happening right here,” said Heeg. “We are trapping people in camps…I used to wonder what it was like to live under the Nazis, and now I know, I’m living it. It’s shocking, it’s hard to comprehend at the same time that it’s happening every single day.

Jury selection on Thursday was closed off from the public and media by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, who is hearing the case. Adelman was responding to concerns from both the prosecution and defense that public questioning would taint the jury. An audio feed allowing media to listen to the jury selection process was restored following a legal challenge by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Sister Barbara Pfarr, who is among the leaders of the faith-based social justice group MICAH, said that the national attention on Dugan’s case shows that the judge struck a nerve by standing up to the Trump administration. Pfarr was disturbed by the effort to restrict press access during jury selection, and wondered whether anything similar would happen during the trial. “That’s the other big reason that I’m here, we’ve lost our democracy.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0306-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:58:23.884514

A woman who was four months pregnant and experiencing bleeding had not been seen by a doctor for months.
Some pregnant women were sleeping on concrete floors.
A woman who was four months pregnant was denied medication for gestational diabetes.
As Nezer told me: “Before this year, detaining pregnant women was the rare exception, and there were safeguards.","Absorbing the news about the brutal treatment of detainees, to say nothing of the outright murder of “suspected” drug runners in the Caribbean, I think back to a conversation I had in February of this year. My interlocutor was a Trump voter who had just had a friendly encounter with an African immigrant striver – the kind who came from poverty and had started a successful business here.

I recall saying, “I hope he has his documents in order.”

The Trump voter scoffed: “They’re not going after people like him. They’re only going after the criminals.”

Eleven months later, that naive faith has been smashed. Not his – mine. I have no idea how that person feels about the Trump administration now, but when I advised in February that they were going to cast a wide net for deportations, I had no idea how bad it would be. This is not just a matter of aggressive deportation. The things that are being done by our government to our fellow human beings are monstrous.

The testimony of the Venezuelans who were deported to CECOT prison in El Salvador is harrowing. Snatched from workplaces or homes on mere suspicion of being criminals, 252 men were bundled onto planes and flown to a prison known for torture. There, courtesy of a heinous bargain between Trump and Nayib Bukele, the dictator of El Salvador, they were “trampled, kicked … forced to kneel for hours,” as well as waterboarded, forced to sleep on mesh metal bunks, shot with rubber bullets, forced into stress positions (including the “crane” in which their wrists were handcuffed behind their backs and then lifted to put pressure on the shoulders and back) and sexually assaulted. At least one attempted suicide. Their accounts are available now only because El Salvador arranged a prisoner exchange with Venezuela in July.

Copious reporting has since demonstrated that only a fraction of those deported had criminal records in the United States and most of those were for relatively minor offenses such as shoplifting, possession of drug paraphernalia or traffic violations. Only six had convictions for violent crimes.

Those enjoying what they imagine is righteous pleasure at the abuse of the “worst of the worst” might want to consider the testimony of Physicians for Human Rights or the Women’s Refugee Commission, both of which have reported on the treatment of a group that the Trump administration apparently considers a dire threat: pregnant, nursing and postpartum women.

Melanie Nezer, vice president for advocacy and external relations at the Women’s Refugee Commission, described the conditions that hundreds of these women are facing in U.S. detention centers. A woman who was four months pregnant and experiencing bleeding had not been seen by a doctor for months. Another had a miscarriage and was deported while still bleeding.

Nezer described pregnant women being forced into overcrowded detention facilities with inadequate sanitary facilities, only frozen burritos or potato chips to eat, lack of clean drinking water (except by purchase) and no medical care or medicines. Some pregnant women were sleeping on concrete floors. A woman who was four months pregnant was denied medication for gestational diabetes.

Among these dangerous criminals that the Trump administration is devoting huge resources to detaining and deporting were a mother arrested as she was on her way to pick up her special-needs child from school, a mother separated from her 2-month-old baby, the mother of a 5-year-old whose husband is a U.S. citizen and hundreds of others (though exact numbers are impossible to obtain due to government noncooperation). Among those Nezer interviewed in Honduras were housecleaners, restaurant workers and stay-at-home moms. All of them were working, and quite a few had open asylum cases pending.

As Nezer told me: “Before this year, detaining pregnant women was the rare exception, and there were safeguards. Now it happens all the time and conditions are beyond inhumane.”

ICE agreements with local entities

What they're saying:

The Attorney General’s Office stated that only county boards of commissioners, not sheriffs, can enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE.

This comes after Ramsey County Attorney John Choi requested an opinion to clarify if Minnesota sheriffs are allowed to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE and if those agreements permit local police officers to detain anyone who would otherwise be released from custody without a civil detainer from ICE.

The opinion highlights that sheriffs can enter contracts for police services with towns and cities, but not with the federal government. This distinction indicates that the omission of federal contracts is intentional, according to AG Ellison's opinion.

The opinion also clarifies that 287(g) agreements do not authorize Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals solely based on ICE detainers. Officers must comply with state arrest laws.

The backstory:

The opinion builds on a February 2025 ruling that prohibits holding individuals based solely on immigration detainers if state law requires their release.

Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event.
It provides eligible migrants with work authorisation and temporary protection from deportation.
In recent months, the administration has removed the protective status for migrants from numerous countries, including Haiti, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.
Those programs make it easier for U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to bring family members into the country.","The U.S. is ending temporary legal status for citizens of Ethiopia in the United States, according to a government notice on Friday, as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on legal and illegal immigration.

""After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Ethiopia no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a notice posted in the Federal Register.

Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorisation and temporary protection from deportation.

The program was created in 1991, and under Biden, it was extended to cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians. Noem reversed the extensions in February, saying they were no longer justified.

In recent months, the administration has removed the protective status for migrants from numerous countries, including Haiti, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. In November, Trump announced the termination of protection for Somalis in Minnesota.

Trump has made controlling immigration a central plank of his second White House term. Cancelling TPS protections is a boost to the administration's campaign to deport millions of people.

The cancellations have been challenged in court.

The Supreme Court in October cleared the way for the administration to revoke TPS for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, granting a request to put on hold a federal judge's ruling that Noem lacked the authority to terminate the status while litigation proceeds.

The Homeland Security department also said on Friday it was no longer processing legacy cases under the Cuban and Haitian family reunification parole program, according to a post in the Federal Register.
