BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) – The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to ‍be released on bond.

That directive came in an email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing on Friday in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration’s policy of denying bond hearings.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that “the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply ‌with final declaratory judgments.”

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges ‌to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying people bond hearings ​was unlawful.

“We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to ‍protect the class,” Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ​ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU’s request, Saris scheduled ​a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for ‍comment.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, “applicants for admission” to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United ‍States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a ‍decision in September that adopted the ‍administration’s interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in ​a ruling in December said that the administration’s interpretation was contrary to law ​and that, ⁠as a result, the board’s ruling was “no longer controlling.”

Yet Riley in ‌Tuesday’s email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board’s decision “remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.”

Lawyers with the ACLU said that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris’ decision.

Yet the lawyers said they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond hearings.

ST. PAUL, MN — U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration, Integrity, Security, and Enforcement, and Ilhan Omar (MN-05) today hosted a shadow hearing titled Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s Deadly Assault on Minnesota. Twenty-seven Members of Congress attended from across the country to conduct oversight.

“Today, I hosted the the sixth hearing in my series Kidnapped and Disappeared, to continue my congressional fact-finding duties at a time of intense trauma and terror for Minnesotans who are being subjected to the lawlessness and violence of ICE and Border Patrol agents,” said Jayapal. “We heard from incredibly powerful witnesses — members of the community who are standing up for their neighbors, and even who have been detained and had their rights violated for no reason. Instead of making us safer, Trump is deliberately escalating tensions in a city where crime rates have been declining. And the tactics are only accelerating. Let me be clear: this pattern of reckless, even lethal, use of force cannot continue, and we will do everything in our power to hold this Administration accountable and stop this lawlessness.”

“I was honored to host this crucial hearing with Rep. Jayapal,” said Omar. “The Twin Cities is under attack from the Trump administration. There is no modern precedent for this level of federal overreach, violence, and lawlessness carried out in the name of immigration enforcement. I’m grateful to my congressional colleagues from all across the country who joined us to raise the alarm and learn what has been happening on the ground.”

“Every Minnesotan has the right to feel safe and welcome. The actions of the Trump administration and Kristi Noem’s DHS are an attack on our state that is making our community more dangerous. ICE and DHS agents have threatened and assaulted workers in their workplaces, families on the way to day care, and students outside their schools. These actions must end,” said Representative Betty McCollum (MN-04). “At our hearing today, we heard from Minnesotans whose lives have been impacted by the Trump administration’s actions. I thank every one of our witnesses for sharing their testimony. I also want to thank my House Democratic colleagues for traveling to Minnesota’s Fourth Congressional District to stand in solidarity against Trump and Kristi Noem’s assault on our state. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go, and ICE must cease operations in Minnesota.”

This hearing featured testimony from a slate of local elected leaders, including Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and Saint Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, followed by a panel of witnesses including Executive Director of the ACLU of Minnesota Deepinder Mayell, Executive Director of Unidos MN Emilia González Avalos, Executive Director of Minnesota Chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-MN) Jaylani Hussein, Chief of Police of Mendota Heights Police Department Kelly McCarthy, and community members Patty and Mubashir.

“Our work aims to vindicate the rights of Minnesotans who have been victimized by their own government simply for exercising their First Amendment rights, to end the false sense of impunity that fuels the worst of federal agents’ misconduct, and to ensure that Minnesotans can assemble, observe, document and criticize – without fear of retaliation,” said Deepinder Mayell, Executive Director of the ACLU of Minnesota.

“I was made to feel scared and humiliated throughout the arrest process, and at the detention center, I was made to feel intimidated and as though my constitutional rights and biological needs didn’t matter,” said Patty, a community member. “After all that, I was released without charges, which makes it clear to me that this is more of a campaign to spread fear and terror than it is to enforce the law. My neighbors and I are collateral damage to the Trump administration’s political theater — a campaign to paint Black and brown people, and ‘liberals,’ as villains to distract from an unprecedented reign of corruption and criminality at the federal level, while at the same time making it clear to all of us — even U.S. citizens — that this administration does not and will not honor the basic constitutional rights to which we are all entitled.”

“At no time did any officer ask me whether I was a citizen or if I had any immigration status,” said Mubashir, a community member. “They did not ask for any identifying information, nor did they ask about my ties to the community, how long I had lived in the Twin Cities, my family in Minnesota, or anything else about my circumstances.”

“We have to acknowledge that the tactics being used by some ICE agents during Operation Metro Surge are reducing the public’s trust in local police, making the jobs of our cops harder, and making us all less safe,” said Chief of Police of Mendota Heights Police Department Kelly McCarthy.

This was the sixth shadow hearing in this series, each of which has focused on a different aspect of immigration oversight. The others have focused on detention abuses, Trump’s assault on Chicago, families that have been torn apart, unlawful third-country deportations, and efforts to undermine due process.

It’s a pattern of vehicles being used as weapons by violent agitators to attack our law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.
He then drove the van directly at ICE officers, DHS officials said.
Who fired shots: Unnamed federal law enforcement officer Description: According to DHS, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” on Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022.
An officer chased him on foot and tried to arrest him, and Sosa-Celis “began to resist and violently assault” the officer, DHS said.","Federal immigration officers have shot 11 people since September as the Department of Homeland Security has ramped up deportation operations around the country. In the majority of the shootings, officers have fired into cars — a tactic that law enforcement authorities and policing experts have been trying for decades to curtail.

The vehicle shootings raise serious concerns among policing experts about the rapidly expanding deployment of DHS personnel into American communities, where officers are regularly captured on video clashing with immigrants who are in the country illegally as well as citizens who protest the arrests.

The shootings “are not one-offs,” said Jim Bueermann, the former police chief in Redlands, California, who now runs the Future Policing Institute, a research group. “This is clearly developing into a pattern and practice of how they deal with people in the enforcement of immigration laws, and to me that’s the most alarming thing we’re seeing.”

DHS says that in each case, the officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Customs and Border Protection believed their lives were in danger and that in several of the incidents, officers were injured.

“The pattern is NOT of law enforcement using deadly force. It’s a pattern of vehicles being used as weapons by violent agitators to attack our law enforcement,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Dangerous criminals — whether they be illegal aliens or U.S. citizens — are assaulting law enforcement and turning their vehicles into weapons to attack law enforcement.”

The 10 shootings, detailed below, show the varied circumstances and places where ICE and CBP officers have opened fire on people while they were conducting President Donald Trump’s campaign to crack down on immigrants in the U.S. The effort has unleashed thousands of officers across the country, raiding homes and workplaces, approaching people in courthouses, immigration offices and stores, and stopping people on the street. A protest movement has grown to resist the operations, leading to confrontations.

The people who were shot include suspected criminals, immigrants who lack permanent legal status and U.S. citizens. Three died. It is not clear how many of the shootings federal authorities have fully investigated; there have been no public reports of any findings, including whether the gunfire was deemed justified or whether officers have been disciplined. In at least four cases, people shot by agents have been charged with crimes; in two of those cases, the charges were later dismissed.

Firing on cars is one common thread. In seven cases, officers said they shot because a car was moving and they believed it posed a threat.

Chris Burbank, a former police chief in Salt Lake City who has helped the Justice Department investigate agencies suspected of civil rights abuses, said it was unsettling to see repeated cases of federal immigration officers’ firing on drivers. Since at least the 1990s, he said, police departments have tried to curb such shootings by adopting new standards guiding how officers deal with motorists. The movement, he said, was largely driven by cases in which people were needlessly injured or killed because officers said they were afraid they were going to get run over.

The new guidelines have been published by the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonprofit organization that studies policing nationwide, and adopted by many police departments. They aimed to prevent officers from positioning themselves in front of or behind vehicles and sought to limit when an officer was allowed to open fire, Burbank said.

DHS has been a focus of that effort. In 2013, the Police Executive Research Forum released a report that indicated CBP officers were deliberately putting themselves in the paths of cars, “exposing themselves to additional risk and creating justification for the use of deadly force.” The group recommended teaching officers that shooting at a car is dangerous and should be avoided and to adopt policies restricting it. DHS’ current policy prohibits officers from firing at moving vehicles, unless they have “reasonable belief” that the drivers pose imminent threats of death or serious injury. Officers should consider the hazards of out-of-control cars, the policy says.

Burbank said he wondered whether officers were being trained on that policy.

Based on his experience and observations of ICE conduct in recent months, including several of the shootings, Burbank said he felt that “there is not a lot of training, not a lot of accountability going on, and you have the feeling of ‘do your jobs at all costs.’” He added, “That’s a really difficult situation to put any law enforcement in, because it takes away your ability to de-escalate.”

Homeland Security officials have forcefully defended their officers, saying they are increasingly in danger, facing a steep uptick in attacks and violent protesters. “Officers are highly trained in de-escalation tactics and regularly receive ongoing use of force training,” McLaughlin said. She said officers are also trained to use “the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations and to prioritize the safety of the public and our officers.”

DHS requires every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm to be reported and reviewed, and all shootings are examined by “an appropriate law enforcement agency,” McLaughlin said. Those investigations are then followed by an internal ICE review.

DHS has not provided updates on any internal investigations into the shootings. The FBI, which is reviewing at least some of the encounters, said it does not talk about its investigations.

DHS shootings since September 2025

Place: Franklin Park, Illinois

Date: Sept. 12, 2025

Who was shot: Silverio Villegas González was killed.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Villegas González, 38, an immigrant from Mexico living in the U.S. illegally, was pulled over by ICE officers during a vehicle stop. The officers parked their Jeep in front of Villegas González’s car, with one officer approaching the vehicle from the driver’s side and the other from the passenger’s side. Neither was wearing body cameras, but some of the initial interaction was caught on business security video: An officer appeared to reach inside the car, just as Villegas González backed up and then pulled forward. DHS said Villegas González hit and dragged one of the officers, who opened fire on the vehicle. Villegas González crashed into a nearby truck; he was taken to the hospital, where he later died. His autopsy indicated he was shot in the neck. ICE said he had a history of reckless driving.

Latest: The status of the federal investigation into the shooting is unclear.

Place: Chicago

Date: Oct. 4, 2025

Who was shot: Marimar Martinez was injured.

Who fired shots: CBP agent Charles Exum

Description: Martinez, 30, a U.S. citizen, was driving in the city’s Southwest Side when, federal officials said, she intentionally struck a vehicle belonging to three Border Patrol agents and worked with another driver to box in the agents’ car. Exum was unable to move or get out of the vehicle and fired about five shots at Martinez, federal officials said. Martinez then drove off, but paramedics found her at a nearby repair shop; she was taken to the hospital, where she was treated for gunshot wounds. She was arrested on charges of impeding law enforcement, but her lawyers said it was the federal agents who rammed her car with their vehicle. Exum bragged about the shooting in text messages to other agents, according to records presented in court. During a hearing in the case, Exum testified that “I did what I had to do to save my life.” Almost two months after the shooting, a judge dismissed the charges against Martinez after federal prosecutors agreed to drop the case. The judge also denied a request to release body camera video.

Latest: Martinez intends to file a lawsuit, according to her attorney, Christopher Parente.

Place: Los Angeles

Date: Oct. 21, 2025

Who was shot: Carlitos Ricardo Parias was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Parias, 44, a Mexican national who is known on TikTok as “Richard LA,” and who federal authorities said was living illegally in the U.S., left his southern Los Angeles home at 8:45 a.m. and was followed by federal officers executing an arrest warrant for him related to a federal immigration proceeding, federal officials said. Parias’ Toyota Camry was boxed in by three government vehicles. Federal officials said that Parias failed to comply with commands to get out of his car and submit to an arrest and that he tried to dislodge his vehicle by driving it back and forth, putting the officers in danger. Body camera video from an ICE officer showed the officer boxing in Parias’ car, then getting out and breaking open the passenger-side window. Holding a gun, the officer shouted commands for Parias to turn off the car. Amid the chaos, the officer opened fire, striking Parias in the arm. One bullet ricocheted and hit a U.S. marshal in the hand, federal officials said. Parias was charged with assault on a federal officer. Two months later, a federal judge dismissed the charge, citing constitutional violations by the government for depriving Parias of access to counsel while he was being detained and failing to meet deadlines.

Latest: Parias remains at a detention center in Adelanto, California. Federal prosecutors filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of his criminal charge.

Place: Phoenix

Date: Oct. 29, 2025

Who was shot: Jose Garcia-Sorto was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Garcia-Sorto, whom DHS described as a Honduran in the U.S. illegally, was stopped by ICE officers around 4 a.m. along Interstate 17. DHS officials said Garcia-Sorto began to pull away when officers approached his car. An officer who was in the path of the vehicle “defensively discharged his service weapon” twice, officials added. The officer was taken to the hospital for evaluation; the extent of any injuries was unclear. DHS said that Garcia-Sorto was also treated at the hospital for a wound and was stable and that he was later released. It is unknown whether the interaction was captured on video.

Latest: Garcia-Sorto is being held at a detention center in Florence, Arizona. No criminal charges have been announced against him in the shooting.

Place: Ontario, California

Date: Oct. 30, 2025

Who was shot: Carlos Jimenez was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed ICE officer

Description: Jimenez, 25, a U.S. citizen, was driving a Lexus SUV near his home in Ontario when, federal officials said, he pulled up to immigration enforcement officers who were stopping another vehicle. Federal officials said that Jimenez did not initially comply with commands to leave the scene and that after he pulled forward, he backed up and accelerated toward the officers and the other vehicle. That’s when one of the officers fired their weapon, striking Jimenez in the shoulder, federal officials said. Jimenez drove from the scene and checked himself into a hospital. He was later taken into custody. It is unclear whether there is video from the incident. Federal prosecutors charged Jimenez with assault of a federal officer and said in a complaint that the officer “feared” he was going to hit them, although it did not specify whether any officers were injured. His lawyers said that he wanted to warn the officers that they were blocking a school bus stop where children would be arriving and that he did try to leave the scene. Jimenez pleaded not guilty and was released on a $10,000 bond.

Latest: A trial is scheduled for April 13.

Who was shot: Isaias Sanchez Barboza was killed.

Who fired shots: Unnamed CBP agent

Description: A 31-year-old Mexican national was one of several people wearing camouflage clothing spotted by Border Patrol agents on the riverbank along the U.S.-Mexico border, west of the Rio Grande City Port of Entry, CBP officials said. As the agents approached just after 4 p.m., the group scattered, with some running back toward Mexico. Agents tried to apprehend one of the men, later identified by Texas officials as Barboza, according to DHS. An agent reported he was engaged in an “active struggle” for about two minutes, and ultimately the agent opened fire at least three times. Other Border Patrol agents arrived at the scene, requested emergency medical help and performed CPR, the DHS said. Barboza was pronounced dead at a hospital, CBP officials said. It is unclear whether there is video of the encounter.

Latest: Barboza’s body was returned to Mexico, according to the Texas Rangers, which said their investigation continues.

Description: Sousa-Martins, a Portuguese national who DHS said overstayed a visa that expired in 2009, was in his van when ICE officers approached him in a Baltimore suburb where they were conducting an operation. DHS officials said Sousa-Martins did not comply with their request to turn off the engine and instead rammed the van into several ICE vehicles as he tried to flee. He then drove the van directly at ICE officers, DHS officials said. The officers opened fire, striking Sousa-Martins, who was hospitalized. It is unclear whether there is video from the incident.

Latest: No criminal charges were announced against Sousa-Martins, who remains in ICE custody. The shooting is under investigation by the Anne Arundel County Police Department. Three weeks after the shooting, police contradicted DHS’ initial narrative that Sousa-Martins had a passenger in the van who was injured when the van crashed; they said the other man was already in custody in an ICE vehicle at the time. In a subsequent statement to NBC News, DHS corroborated that detail.

Place: Minneapolis

Date: Jan. 7, 2026

Who was shot: Renee Good was killed.

Who fired shots: ICE officer Jonathan Ross

Description: Good, 37, a Minneapolis resident and U.S. citizen, was behind the wheel of a Honda Pilot SUV on Portland Avenue, parked perpendicular to one-way traffic as federal law enforcement vehicles were trying to get through. Ross got out of his vehicle and circled the SUV while he was recording with his cellphone. Two other officers approached Good from the driver’s side, ordering her to get out of the car, according to video from bystanders, as well as Ross’ cellphone. One officer pulled on the driver’s door handle. Good briefly reversed, then moved forward, turning the SUV’s wheels to the right, away from the officers and in the direction of traffic. At that moment, Ross, who was by then at the driver’s-side corner of the hood, fired three times, striking Good in the chest and head. Good lost control of the SUV, which accelerated down the street and crashed. She was pronounced dead soon after. A DHS official said Ross fired in self-defense and sustained internal bleeding to the torso but did not provide any more details about his injuries.

Latest: The shooting is under investigation by the FBI, which has cut out state and local authorities, although Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said she is collecting evidence on her own. Good’s family hired civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci, who also represented the loved ones of George Floyd. Romanucci said he is dedicated to “fervently pursuing justice on behalf” of Good.

Place: Portland, Oregon

Date: Jan. 8, 2026

Who was shot: Luis David Nino Moncada and Yorlenys Betzabeth Zambrano-Contreras were injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed CBP agent

Description: Nino Moncada, 33, a Venezuelan national who authorities say had been ordered removed from the country in 2024, was driving a vehicle targeted during an enforcement operation tied to a prostitution ring of the Tren de Aragua gang, federal officials said. Nino Moncada did not comply with commands to get out the car and instead reversed and struck an unoccupied Border Patrol vehicle multiple times, according to federal officials. In response, an agent opened fire, hitting Nino Moncada and a female passenger, Zambrano-Contreras, a Venezuelan national who authorities say entered the U.S. illegally in 2023. The pair fled. Nino Moncada, who was struck in the arm, and Zambrano-Contreras, who was hit in the chest, were hospitalized and later released. The FBI said there was no body camera video of the shooting. Nino Moncada was charged with aggravated assault of a federal officer with a deadly or dangerous weapon and depredation of federal property in excess of $1,000. Zambrano-Contreras was charged with entering the U.S. illegally.

Latest: Nino Moncada, who is being held in a Multnomah County jail, has pleaded not guilty. Zambrano-Contreras remains at a detention center in Tacoma, Washington. The Oregon attorney general said he is opening an investigation into the shooting while the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.

Place: Minneapolis

Date: Jan. 14, 2026

Who was shot: Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis was injured.

Who fired shots: Unnamed federal law enforcement officer

Description: According to DHS, federal law enforcement officers were conducting a “targeted traffic stop” on Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. He fled in his car, crashed into a parked car and ran away, DHS said. An officer chased him on foot and tried to arrest him, and Sosa-Celis “began to resist and violently assault” the officer, DHS said. During the struggle, two people came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, DHS said. Sosa-Celis broke loose and began hitting the officer with either the shovel or a broomstick, DHS said. The officer fired, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg. ICE officers then arrested all three of the alleged attackers. DHS said the man who was shot and the officer were taken to a hospital.

Latest: The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said it is investigating the shooting.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260115-ice-shootings-lr-db8fd6.jpg",N,,2026-01-16 18:59:05.950032

There are thousands of federal immigration agents in Minnesota, and protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continue. Those protests grew after an Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Macklin Good in Minneapolis last week. Another Department of Homeland Security officer shot a man in the leg this week during an arrest. And that has all raised questions about the training immigration officers get and the protocols they're supposed to follow. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been looking into this, and she's with us now to tell us more. Good morning.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: So the administration has made it clear from the beginning it wants to increase deportations. It wants to do that fast. And to do that, it's going to hire a lot more immigration agents, so that invites the question of just how these people are being trained. So what are the concerns about that?

BUSTILLO: Immigration advocates have questioned how immigration officers are being trained to not just conduct arrests but also engage with U.S. citizens, and particularly protesters or observers. For example, the woman who was killed in Minneapolis, Renee Macklin Good, was a U.S. citizen. I will note the officer involved in that incident had been with the agency for several years and not a part of this larger hiring surge. But, you know, I've been looking over the ICE and Customs and Border Protection handbooks, which both provide various procedures for how and when to use force, such as discharging a firearm. But it can also depend on the situation.

MARTIN: So say more about what situations these officers are now facing in their jobs.

BUSTILLO: Officers from both agencies were already interacting with the public in various places. For example, the Department of Homeland Security often provides security at major sporting events and national events. And that's different from an immigration arrest at the border, which is different from an immigration arrest in a parking lot in the interior of the country. But for - over the past year, there has been an increase in what immigration agents call at-large arrests, which means that they're out in the community, like on a street in the interior. And we've seen other agencies, such as Border Patrol, play a bigger role in these operations. Of course, they're facing a lot of protesters and more engagement with citizens as well.

Mark Brown is a use-of-force expert who used to train ICE officers. He's now a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. And he says ICE officers might be working in new situations under President Trump.

MARK BROWN: When you have incidents, you have to look at training. You have to look at, was this - was there a gap in the training? Is there something? You can't train for everything, but training has to adapt to what's current.

BUSTILLO: But in all these situations and in my reviews of the handbooks, there is a certain amount of discretion on what agents are allowed to do.

MARTIN: And say more about that. What do you mean by discretion?

BUSTILLO: So let's look at the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. The officer, Jonathan Ross, was in front of her vehicle when she was at the wheel. The agency says that he was acting in self-defense when he shot her in her car. The law enforcement experts and officials have pointed out that officers are often told not to shoot into vehicles or step in front of them. ICE's own handbook includes this, as well. It explicitly says firearms shall not be discharged solely to disable moving vehicles. But it also gives DHS officers the right to use deadly force when there's, quote, ""reasonable belief that the subject"" poses an imminent threat.

And that second part is what this administration is really leaning into. The claim that she was a threat is disputed by local leaders and contradicted by video evidence. The shooting is also still under various investigations. And a lot of claims from the administration that it is a felony to interfere? It's not always that simple. Just because the administration thinks something's a felony doesn't mean a judge in court will agree.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Ximena, thanks.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

The Democrats gave general outlines for how they intend to use legislation and the budget process to increase health care access, protect immigrants and improve public safety all within 30 days. House Speaker Javier Martinez (D-Albuquerque) predicted the Legislature’s achievements will offer a stark contrast to the “dysfunction” in Washington, D.C.

“We will have to make hard choices as we build the state budget, because, unlike the federal government, we have to have a balanced budget every single day,” he said. “So we’ll have to make sure that we put families first and not balance those budgets on their backs, which I can assure you, we will not.”

NM Governor’s office proposes $11.3B state budget and increased spending

In addition to passing a roughly $11 billion operating budget, the Legislature will consider legislation regarding medical malpractice and other health care reforms, a ban on local government involvement in immigrant detention, public safety and road repairs.

According to the speakers and a news release the House released Friday afternoon, House Democrats are hoping to attract and retain more doctors; hold gun dealers accountable for straw purchases; protect license plate data from being shared with the federal government; and create an independent commission overseeing the Children, Youth and Families Department, among other proposals.

“We may not know all that the future holds, but we’re ready to protect our people, regardless of the immigration status, the color of their skin or the languages they speak,” said Rep. Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque). “Because all New Mexicans deserve to feel safe in their communities.”

Advocacy groups push to expand immigrant services, driver protections during session

Much of the news conference focused on the Democrats’ plans for health care amid a statewide doctor shortage that has prompted sharp criticism from Republicans and advocacy groups.

Martinez and Rep. Reena Szczepanski (D-Santa Fe) described a medical malpractice reform bill that aims to reduce the number of malpractice lawsuits as well as protect doctors from losing their practices if they get sued.

The bill has not yet been introduced. Rep. Liz Thomson (D-Albuquerque), chair of the House Health and Human Services Committee, told Source New Mexico after the news conference that House lawmakers are still working with the governor’s office on the reforms, which she expects to be wrapped into one piece of legislation.

Republicans and Senate Democrats are expected to introduce their own legislation on the topic, as well, including measures that will cap the amount of damages that can be paid or raise the standard at which a jury can find health care workers liable for injuries.

President Trump has threatened to use the military to stop the protests in Minneapolis by invoking the Insurrection Act. We'll have more on what that would mean in a few minutes, but we're going to start with a report about the situation on the ground.

A MARTÍNEZ, HOST:

On Wednesday, immigration officers shot another man, this time in the leg, which sparked unrest on the city's north side.

MARTIN: NPR's Meg Anderson is in Minneapolis and is with us now to give us the latest. Good morning, Meg.

MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Good morning.

MARTIN: You know, looking at this from the outside, things seem pretty volatile. But thankfully, you're there. So could you just describe what you're seeing?

ANDERSON: Yeah. There are now as many as 3,000 federal immigration officers on the ground or arriving soon here in the Twin Cities. That's nearly five times the number of Minneapolis police officers. And, you know, the city is sometimes quiet until it is really, really not. And that's because the fierce resistance to this ICE surge continues to be noisy as community members are following immigration officers in their car, honking and whistling. Here's how that sounds.

(SOUNDBITE OF HONKING)

ANDERSON: And I should note the observers filming and making noise. Those peaceful acts of resistance, even though they're chaotic, are protected by the Constitution. But ICE has responded to some confrontations over the last week with a lot of aggression. Over the last five days, NPR reporters, myself included, we've seen ICE officers using tear gas, flash bangs and pepper balls to disperse crowds. But the community here, you know, it's responding in quieter ways, too.

MARTIN: Well, say more about that, if you would. How so?

ANDERSON: Yeah. So if you drive around the Twin Cities, you'll see parents and other community members standing guard outside of schools and day cares with whistles around their necks. Residents are collecting food donations and giving rides to people who are afraid to leave the house. And people are afraid to leave their homes. I spoke to one woman, an asylum-seeker with two young U.S. citizen children. She asked to only be identified by her first initial, A, because she's afraid she'll be deported if she's identified. She has not left her home in several weeks.

A: (Non-English language spoken).

ANDERSON: She said she feels like she can't see a future, a stable tomorrow for herself or her family. And these fears, being afraid to leave the house, they're not unfounded. NPR reporters have witnessed immigration officers stopping and even detaining people of color seemingly at random on the street. I should note that just yesterday, the ACLU filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of racial profiling against Latino and Somali people here.

MARTIN: And President Trump also threatened yesterday to use the Insurrection Act against Minnesota. Would you explain exactly what that would mean?

ANDERSON: Yeah. So first, the president has threatened to use that law many times before and hasn't. Still, in a post on Truth Social, he said he would invoke the act if state officials, quote, don't ""stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the patriots of ICE."" That law is more than 200 years old. It's controversial. Basically, it would give the president sweeping powers to deploy the military here without the state's consent. The last time it was invoked was during the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.

MARTIN: And how are local leaders responding to this?

ANDERSON: So Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he would challenge the use of the law in court. He emphasized in a statement to NPR that Minnesotans are responding peacefully. There's no reason for that law to be invoked. Senator Amy Klobuchar has said the administration is escalating the situation and not the other way around.

MARTIN: That is NPR's Meg Anderson. Meg, thank you.

ANDERSON: You're welcome.

The ruling by Judge David O. Carter of the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, Calif., appears to thwart the federal government’s efforts to comb through the election rolls in the nation’s most populous state to potentially challenge voters’ eligibility.

About two dozen states are defending themselves from similar lawsuits filed by the Trump administration, which has sought to build a national voter roll with the information.

Many of those states are governed by Democrats, who have argued that the release of sensitive information, such as driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers, would be unconstitutional and would have a chilling effect on elections.

President Trump and his allies have continued to spread false claims about voter fraud and states’ allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.

“The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,” Judge Carter wrote. “The case before the court is one of these cuts that imperils all Americans. The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the legislative branch, not the executive.”

In the 33-page decision, Judge Carter, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, said that releasing voters’ personal information would violate a plethora of federal and state privacy laws. He said the Justice Department was seeking to use civil rights legislation to “amass and retain an unprecedented amount of confidential voter data.”

“The Constitution demands such respect, and the executive may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections it seeks to do so here,” Judge Carter wrote.

It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration planned to appeal the decision.

The White House referred questions on the ruling on Thursday to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a statement on Thursday, Shirley N. Weber, California’s secretary of state and a Democrat who was named as a defendant in the case, praised the lawsuit’s dismissal.

“As California secretary of state, I am entrusted with ensuring that California’s state election laws are enforced — including state laws that protect the privacy of Californians’ data,” Ms. Weber said. “I will continue to uphold my promise to Californians to protect our democracy, and I will continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”

A day earlier, a federal court upheld California’s new congressional maps, rejecting claims by Republicans and the Trump administration that they were unconstitutional.

“Back-to-back days now of Trump and his Administration losing to California,” the press office of Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on social media on Thursday.

The Democratic National Committee had filed a brief in the case that raised concerns about the release of voter data.

“This should be a five-alarm fire for Americans everywhere — it opens the door to privacy concerns and further political retribution,” Ken Martin, the D.N.C. chairman, said after Thursday’s decision.

Despite carrying all seven battleground states in the 2024 presidential election, which he won by more than two million votes, Mr. Trump has clung to unsupported claims about widespread voter fraud and clashed with political adversaries over voter lists.

In Oregon, another state that is being sued, the Justice Department’s case also appeared to be unraveling.

On Wednesday, a federal judge in that state, voicing skepticism about giving the federal government unfettered access to voter data, signaled that he was leaning toward dismissing that lawsuit, the newspaper The Oregonian reported.

The letter notes that roughly 90 percent of listed species are threatened by habitat loss, making the proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation particularly damaging to recovery efforts.","Washington, D.C. – Today, 87 Congressional Democrats demanded the Trump administration withdraw four proposed rules that would blow massive holes in the Endangered Species Act — the law that has saved 99 percent of listed species from extinction.

In a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) and ESA Caucus Co-Chairs Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) and Rep. Don Beyer (D-Virg.) warned the changes would gut environmental review, strip protections from hundreds of vulnerable species, and let politics override science in listing decisions—all while the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service face unprecedented staffing and budget shortfalls thanks to the Trump administration.

""These sweeping changes would fundamentally weaken our nation's most important wildlife conservation law at a time when one million species face extinction globally,"" wrote the lawmakers. ""We urge the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw these proposed rulemakings and instead work to implement the ESA as Congress intended: any regulatory changes should further the objectives of the ESA to conserve species and prevent extinction.""

The ESA has prevented more than 99 percent of listed species from going extinct and has helped hundreds move toward recovery. Section 7 consultations typically take just two weeks for informal review and two months for formal review—contrary to conventional wisdom, the ESA does not stop projects from moving forward. According to one peer-reviewed study, the ESA did not halt a single project between 2008 and 2015.

The lawmakers highlighted how the proposed rules would:

Gut Section 7 consultation requirements by letting agencies claim project impacts ""would occur regardless of whether the proposed action goes forward"" — a loophole that could exempt highways, pipelines, and development projects from meaningful scrutiny;

Strip protections from threatened species by rescinding the ""blanket 4(d) rule"" that extends baseline protections to all threatened species, creating dangerous years-long protection gaps that resource-agencies can’t fill. The blanket 4(d) rule provides automatic protections to species such as the piping plover and the West Indian Manatee, species listed as threatened in the future would not receive those same baseline protections; and

Let politics override science by injecting cherry-picked 'economic considerations into listing decisions. Congress explicitly required that listing decisions be based solely on the best available science, not on arbitrary evaluations of certain impacts or political pressures.

""With reduced staff and resources, the Services should prioritize addressing the backlog of species awaiting protection and advancing recovery efforts for those already listed, rather than redirecting attention to rewriting long-standing and effective regulations,"" continued the lawmakers. ""Habitat destruction and climate change are accelerating species extinction to alarming rates, and we should be working to uphold and strengthen the ESA, not weaken it.""

The letter notes that roughly 90 percent of listed species are threatened by habitat loss, making the proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation particularly damaging to recovery efforts.

ACLU says top immigration judge instructed colleagues to ignore court ruling

Federal judges have ruled Trump administration's practice of denying bond hearing is unlawful

Board of Immigration Appeals adopted administration's interpretation of law

BOSTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The top U.S. immigration judge has told her colleagues that they are not bound by a federal court ruling that declared the Trump administration cannot place thousands of people in mandatory detention without an opportunity to be released on bond.

That directive came in an email Chief Immigration Judge Teresa Riley sent her colleagues on Tuesday that the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts attached to a filing on Friday, opens new tab in Boston federal court in a lawsuit challenging the administration's policy of denying bond hearings.

Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter. Sign up here.

The ACLU said the email was evidence that ""the government has deliberately and systematically instructed every Immigration Judge in the country not to comply with final declaratory judgments.""

The civil rights group said the statement directs judges to disregard court rulings by U.S. District Judge Sunshine Sykes in Riverside, California, and U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston in separate class action lawsuits brought on behalf of people who were already living in the United States when they were detained. Both judges held that denying people bond hearings was unlawful.

""We have asked for a status conference to update the court on this troubling development — which significantly impacts the rights of our class members — and anticipate seeking additional relief to protect the class,"" Dan McFadden, managing attorney at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

At the ACLU's request, Saris scheduled a Tuesday hearing.

The Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, did not respond to a request for comment.

Immigration judges are not part of the federal judiciary but are instead employees of the Justice Department, which is part of the Trump administration.

Under federal immigration law, ""applicants for admission"" to the United States are subject to mandatory detention while their cases proceed in immigration courts.

Bucking a longstanding interpretation of the law, the Trump administration in July said non-citizens already residing in the United States, and not only those who arrive at a port of entry at the border, qualify as applicants for admission.

The Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department, issued a decision in September that adopted the administration's interpretation.

But Sykes, whose case is a nationwide class action, in a ruling in December said that the administration's interpretation was contrary to law and that, as a result, the board's ruling was ""no longer controlling.""

Yet Riley in Tuesday's email told her colleagues that because Sykes did not issue an injunction, the board's decision ""remains binding precedent on agency adjudicators.""

Lawyers with the ACLU said that prior to that email, the immigration court in Massachusetts had begun holding bond hearings again, consistent with Saris' decision.

Yet the lawyers said they received multiple reports on Thursday that an immigration judge was denying detainee requests for bond hearings.

City officials say nobody has inquired about the property, which may require a zoning change if it truly was pursued as an immigration facility.","Amid the tumultuous blitz of immigration officers into Minnesota, Central Florida congressmen Darren Soto and Maxwell Frost are warning that the Orlando area could be ICE’s next major target — and there are indications the surge could already be underway.

The Hope CommUnity Center said in a Friday evening statement it confirmed about 300 people had been booked into the Orange County Jail on immigration holds in the previous 48 hours alone — which would mark a steep increase compared to the roughly 70 people booked on such holds on a normal day.

“We have received multiple verifiable and credible reports that ICE and Border Patrol agents are stopping individuals in our communities, requesting documentation, and detaining people, often without a clear explanation,” said Felipe Sousa-Lazaballet, the executive director of the center and a Democratic candidate for the Florida House.

A spokesperson for the jail told the Sentinel that a total of 831 people had been booked on such holds since Jan. 1. County Commissioner Nicole Wilson said that number was a shocking total, since only about 300 people had been booked in December.

Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said he was advised by his jail chief that a significant number of the recent bookings were people who were rebooked into the jail. Under the county’s agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency can only keep a person booked there for 72 hours before transporting them to a federal facility — though the agency apparently has been taking detainees elsewhere, only to bring them back to the jail.

Rumors had swirled on social media this week that ICE had booked 200 hotel rooms for its officers throughout the region this weekend, as well as that officials were touring an east Orlando warehouse Friday for a potential new detainee processing facility.

WFTV reported that a senior ICE advisor confirmed the agency toured the facility, though no contracts have been signed. WKMG later reported that they joined ICE representatives on their tour.

Frost, D-Orlando, said in a video posted to his Facebook page Thursday that “ICE is in the community and that they have made pretty large hotel reservations in surrounding hotels as well.”

The post included a flyer informing people how they can interact with federal authorities, including to ask to see a warrant before opening the door, that you don’t need to provide your immigration status or place of birth, and to let a trusted family member know how to find important documents.

In recent days, the Central Florida area stretching west from Lakeland to east Orange appeared to be a hotspot for immigration enforcement according to People Over Papers, which documents the presence of ICE and other authorities using witness reports. One alleged sighting of four uniformed officers was reported at Disney Springs Thursday evening.

Wilson said she’s received accounts of authorities stopping people across her district in western Orange County, including a landscaping crew on Plant Street in downtown Winter Garden.

Demings said his staff had been unable to confirm if such a surge was planned for this week, but urged county residents to respond in a peaceful manner.

“Whatever response we have in this community, I would always implore our community to respond in a peaceful way,” he said.

Florida has already aggressively participated with federal authorities in immigration enforcement, requiring counties to sign agreements to cooperate with ICE and deputizing the Florida Highway Patrol and other law enforcement agencies to provide enforcement as well.

Under the so-called Operation Tidal Wave, which Gov. Ron DeSantis touted as “the largest joint immigration enforcement operation in ICE’s history,” state authorities have arrested more than 10,000 undocumented immigrants across the state.

While there is an ICE Field Office in Orlando, a processing facility could further ramp up efforts. The Washington Post reported last month that a document it obtained laid out a plan to detain immigrants in warehouses across the country, with a total capacity of 80,000. That includes a network of facilities that could hold about 1,500 a piece.

The document didn’t name Orlando as a location, though it did mention a possible facility in Jupiter, the northern coastal Palm Beach County town.

The Orlando property reportedly toured by ICE is east of Sunbridge Parkway, zoned for industrial uses and is surrounded by land that Tavistock plans to build its massive Sunbridge community with thousands of homes. Today nearly all of those thousands of acres are wooded with pines, palmettos and brush.

The warehouse park, though, is one of the few parcels not controlled by Tavistock, a spokesperson said. A real estate agent listed as marketing the 440,000 square foot warehouse for lease didn’t return a call for comment.

City officials say nobody has inquired about the property, which may require a zoning change if it truly was pursued as an immigration facility. Such usage may even require a conditional-use permit, which requires the approval of the City Council, though it’s unclear if the federal government can work around city rules.

Soto, D-Kissimmee, said his office hasn’t been informed of such a facility in Central Florida, He added he was monitoring increased ICE activity in the region.

“President Trump promised to only deport violent criminals. He has broken this promise countless times in Central Florida,” he said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn’t respond to emailed questions.

But Alex Lanfranconi, DeSantis’ communications director, stoked the flames Thursday by responding to an X account reporting about the warehouse’s alleged 1,500-person capacity. “This is ridiculous,” Lanfranconi wrote. “It needs to hold wayyyy more people.”

Lazaballet told the Sentinel that seeking an immigrant processing center in Orlando is plausible, since the city is also home to one of three immigration courts in Florida, with the other two located in Miami.

“Logistically speaking, it would make sense,” said Sousa-Lazaballet, also the executive director of Hope CommUnity Center.

Amid the talk of an ICE surge, local activists have looked for signs of businesses collaborating with ICE or its sister agency U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, with some groups this week targeting a pet resort in Lake Nona.

Pet Paradise Resort & Spa, which is headquartered in Jacksonville and has multiple locations around the country, took to Instagram to defend its partnership with CBP, saying the dogs they house are used at nearby airports like Orlando International. They denied housing animals brought in by ICE.

Further alarms were raised in light of rumors of ICE agents booking rooms at local hotels at a time when its presence appears to have increased.

“It does track that it feels overwhelming,” Sousa-Lazaballet said. “If they got 200 rooms, that’s in addition to the agents they already have here.”

The Sentinel reached out to area hotels this week but did not find any confirmation of increased ICE bookings. ICE did hold a recruitment event at a Tampa-area Hilton on Thursday and Friday, which drew protests.

At a press conference on Thursday at The Gathering Place Church in Orlando, the Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition and senior pastor at the church, said “we do not want to see any replication of what’s happening in Minnesota.”

Alongside other religious leaders and immigrant advocates, he called on residents to protest ICE actions peacefully and for ICE agents to give undocumented immigrants due process and respect.

“We are telling the administration that any discriminatory action on immigration that puts in danger our families, that separates families, that affects the religious liberty of our churches, the Evangelical community will raise its voice in solidarity,” Salguero said. “It’s very important for everyone to know that our commitment is rooted in non-violence.”",https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tos-l-ice-nalec1150.jpg?w=1024&h=592,N,,2026-01-16 17:58:55.153959

The topline figure, coming in at $50 billion, represents a 16 percent cut compared to FY25, but that’s before subtracting select emergency funding and rescissions. And unlike last year’s continuing resolution extending funding at prior levels, lawmakers put their own stamp on the new spending bill. A host of reporting requirements and mandated briefings will ensure that key actors on Capitol Hill remain engaged with a range of development and humanitarian policy issues in the months ahead.

That said, there are plenty of lingering questions about the extent to which the vision for future international assistance—as sketched out in the bill—comes to fruition, given both the Department of State’s lean staffing and the administration’s views on impoundment and its penchant for withholding funds. Nevertheless, appropriators are voicing a desire to see continued US leadership in the provision of foreign aid and in various multilateral fora. The deal is yet to pass the Senate, but here’s a rundown of how several major accounts fared and what might come next. (You can find the link to the bill text HERE and the joint explanatory statement HERE.)

Global health gets by

Despite years of bipartisan backing and the administration’s stated commitment, the president’s budget proposed a staggering 60 percent cut to funding for global health programs. In contrast, appropriators signaled support for strong US leadership in global health, providing $9.4 billion for the primary global health account, previously split between the Department of State and USAID. That’s $5.6 billion above the administration’s request. That figure is allocated largely to familiar funding priorities, including HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, and even areas left out of the America First Global Health Strategy, such as nutrition, neglected tropical diseases, and family planning and reproductive health.

The compromise bill reaffirms Congress’s desire to keep the US engaged in major health multilaterals—save the World Health Organization—directing US contributions to the Global Fund, Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance), the World Bank-hosted Pandemic Fund, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

Despite breaking with the administration on funding levels, the measure and accompanying report lean into several components of the America First Global Health Strategy. The bill directs a new strategy to expand market access for US biomedical firms and requires a PEPFAR transition strategy that shifts toward country-led programming without sacrificing results. Appropriators also included a mandate to support research and development for breakthrough technologies targeting HIV/AIDs, malaria, and other infectious diseases, which could be read (in part) as an endorsement of the kind of partnership demonstrated by the State Department’s purchase agreement supporting the rollout of the game-changing HIV prevention drug lenacapavir through the Global Fund.

State Department officials have outlined lofty goals for the US global health portfolio as they negotiate and sign a slew of bilateral memoranda of understanding charting global health cooperation with partner countries in the years ahead. Still, lawmakers have questions about precisely how an America First global health agenda might proceed, instituting new reporting requirements on multilateral health engagement, the bilateral global health agreements, and the Global Health Bureau’s plans to launch an innovation fund.

Humanitarian spending on the horizon?

For years, the United States has been the world’s leading provider of humanitarian aid—with structures and systems that, while deeply fragmented, have been capable of responding to urgent needs across a host of contexts. But the Trump administration’s stop-work order, award terminations, and dismantling of USAID threw an enormous wrench in the gears. Humanitarian relief efforts could surely benefit from constructive reforms, and with so many protracted crises around the world, the US would be wise to revisit its response toolkit. But what we’ve witnessed over the past year is simply much less US humanitarian aid. The State Department has touted its responses in the wake of Hurricane Melissa and Typhoon Tino, and, more recently, struck a deal with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs—suggesting a level of continued commitment to humanitarian support so long as it can shape the parameters. Still, it doesn’t negate the fact that humanitarian spending fell well behind pace in FY25. The most generous interpretation may be that intent ran headlong into limited capacity.

Appropriators acquiesce to the administration’s desire for a central humanitarian account—combining the State Department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance with the International Disaster Assistance pot once managed by USAID—but would provide more than double the requested funds. The administration had hoped to channel more funding through the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance account, which the president can draw down at his discretion. With passage of the FY26 Agriculture spending bill last year, lawmakers also rejected the administration’s plans to defund a separate international food aid account that can be used to respond to humanitarian needs.

As the joint explanatory statement suggests, in requesting detailed administration plans for spending humanitarian funds, this will be a key area to watch.

The death of Development Assistance?

Provisions in the bill text and explanatory statement suggest a durable interest in continued investment in aid-supported work previously managed by USAID, with spending directives for advancing food security and agricultural development ($720 million), women’s economic empowerment ($150 million), and global education programs ($691.5 million).

In its FY26 budget, the White House sought to zero out traditional bilateral economic assistance accounts and replace them with a wildly flexible America First Opportunity Fund. Notably, the administration also rescinded billions of dollars in previously appropriated economic aid. Lawmakers seem eager for a more measured approach, rolling the two core accounts (Development Assistance and the Economic Support Fund) into a new National Security Investment Programs (NSIP) bucket meant to link traditional economic development priorities with strategic objectives. Appropriators would provide significantly more resources than the White House requested, and, of those resources, the bill specifies that at least 15 percent should be allocated to Africa, focusing on sub-Saharan Africa, and with just $575 million of the new account carved out for the administration’s America First Opportunity Fund. Democracy programs survive as a separate line item, but with a steep, roughly 40 percent haircut from FY24 and FY25 enacted levels before rescissions.

Safeguarding US shareholding at the IFIs

US engagement with and support for international financial institutions have remained a bright spot in the broader story of recent US development spending. The Trump administration has continued to make commitments and contributions to a number of international financial institutions (IFIs), and the back-to-basics agenda advocated by Treasury officials enjoys some bipartisan buy-in and has received support from other major shareholders (along with some think tank experts). The new spending bill would deliver the first payment toward the administration’s revised pledge to the replenishment of the World Bank’s International Development Association, IDA21, and the first payment for a level pledge at the last Asian Development Fund replenishment; it likewise includes the necessary authorizations for both contributions. With credit to the House Financial Services Committee, the measure also carries a sought-after, money-saving fix that exempts IDA from certain US Securities and Exchange Commission registration requirements. The concessional lending arms of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank remain vital sources of affordable finance for a number of the world’s poorest countries, where continued US leadership and financial support matter.

In addition, under the bill, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) would receive the first payment of a long-awaited capital increase, with $87.5 million teed up after authorization cleared in the continuing resolution. The bill also greenlights US participation in the IDB Invest capital increase—and while stopping short of an explicit appropriation, it provides $75 million in flexible Treasury funding that could enable the administration to make a first payment. Appropriators deflected on IMF quota reform and provided no resources for the African Development Fund, adding to US arrears at the institution. Still, the measure would keep the taps open for both the Global Environment Facility and the International Fund for Agricultural Development even without formal asks from the administration.

Big hopes and a stable budget for DFC

Both the White House and lawmakers have endorsed a bigger, bolder US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). But will resources match ambition? Appropriators would level fund the agency, with language in the explanatory statement encouraging DFC to operationalize the changes in its recent reauthorization bill. After a sluggish FY25 in which, according to recent data, DFC made just over $3 billion in new commitments, DFC enters the new year with plenty of headroom to expand and the ability to invest almost anywhere in the world (with some guardrails). The president’s budget request sought to capitalize a proposed revolving fund that would enable DFC to make better use of its direct equity authority by providing a workaround to longstanding budget scoring constraints. While appropriators didn’t deliver the $3 billion bump requested by the administration, the joint explanatory statement notes that DFC can make transfers to the new DFC Equity Investment Account, subject to congressional notification procedures.

With reauthorization complete and new funding on the horizon, the big question ahead is whether the agency can deliver on its mandate to pursue strategic deals while still generating meaningful development impact. Appropriators also hope DFC’s transparency practices improve further—reminding the agency of its statutory authority to report its transactions to the central foreign aid dashboard, foreignassistance.gov. The agency has been working with the team at the State Department that manages the site, but has struggled with how to present loans, guarantees, and insurance commitments alongside more traditional grant-based aid.

MCC rides again

The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) had a tumultuous last year. It narrowly avoided the fate that befell USAID thanks to a bipartisan cadre of champions, but the agency weathered a slew of program terminations and significant workforce reductions. The new bill would provide $830 million for MCC, roughly 11 percent lower than in recent years, but nowhere near the 75 percent cut envisioned in the president’s budget request.

However, the measure would resume the unfortunate recent trend of subjecting the agency to rescissions of unspent funds. As we’ve highlighted previously, MCC’s multi-year country agreements require the agency to bank substantial sums that it spends down over time. In the wake of recent program terminations, the minibus would claw back more than $661 million—though, again, less than the administration initially sought.

And overall, things may be looking up for the little agency. In the joint explanatory statement, appropriators direct MCC’s CEO (notably, still waiting on a nominee) to notify relevant committees before terminating assistance, specifying a raft of information that must be provided in advance. Meanwhile, key administration officials appear increasingly keen to deploy MCC’s model. With greater budget certainty, a refreshed scorecard, and newly selected partners, the prospects for MCC’s data-driven, good-governance-oriented approach appear promising.

But how do we know any of this spending will achieve its objectives?

If you’ve made it this far, you’re a real one—as the kids say—so we’ll acknowledge that we’ve been struggling more than usual when it comes to talking about two of our favorite topics: evidence and evaluation. On the one hand, amid scarce resources, it seems more important than ever to ensure that US assistance delivers value for money—that is, that programs achieve their intended impact in as cost-effective a manner as possible. On the other hand, we’re acutely aware (as noted above) that in the wake of USAID’s shuttering and other federal workforce reductions, bandwidth is limited. Prior to its dismantling, USAID had taken steps to improve its use and generation of evidence, including establishing an office with precisely that remit. The State Department has historically lagged behind in this area, but in 2023 began endeavoring to make evidence more accessible and actionable—with the goal of informing better decision-making. Despite increased invocation of the importance of outcomes and results, over the last year, we’ve seen no signs (at least shared publicly) that commissioning evaluations of aid-supported programming (to understand what programming actually achieved) or facilitating greater use of rigorous evidence (to design interventions to work well from the start) is a priority for the State Department. It’s encouraging that Capitol Hill still identifies the significance of rigorous evaluation in advancing aid effectiveness (see Section 7011)—and maybe the required strategy will provide an opportunity for the State Department to set new goals that will help it move from more basic but still critical data management (and transparency), to integrating evidence into decision-making and even generating quality evidence through rigorous evaluation.",https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2025-08/corruption-and-poverty-blog-gupta.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:58:46.676954

MINNEAPOLIS

On Thursday, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and send active-duty troops into Minneapolis, MN, where widespread demonstrations continue against the aggressive tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Gregory Svirnovskiy, Kyle Cheney, and Myah Ward report for POLITICO.

The Editorial Board of the Minnesota Star Tribune said the situation in Minneapolis feels like “a military occupation.” The city is “under siege,” the paper said, with “battalions of armed federal agents … moving through neighborhoods, transit hubs, malls and parking lots and staging near churches, mosques and schools. Strangers with guns have metastasized in spaces where daily life should be routine and safe.” The paper urged public protest and civil disobedience to remain peaceful, but wrote “The occupation of Minnesota by ICE cannot stand.”

Minneapolis police and fire departments released new records Thursday night about the killing of Renee Good including the location of gunshot wounds. The New York Times reports.

Some Minnesota school districts are offering students the option to do remote learning as fear spreads through the state’s immigrant communities. Sarah Mervosh reports for the New York Times.

Several Native Americans are being swept up by ICE in Minneapolis. “Tribal leaders and members who live in the greater Minneapolis area say Indigenous family members, friends and neighbors have been stopped, questioned, harassed and, in some cases, detained solely on the basis of their skin color or their names,” Mariana Alfaro reports for the Washington Post.

The ACLU of Minnesota is filing a class action lawsuit against the U.S. government for constitutional rights violations by federal agents. The violations include racially profiling residents, conducting illegal search and seizures, and making arrests without warrants. Stephen Swanson reports for CBS News.

ICE

The Office of the Medical Examiner in El Paso County believes that the death of a man at a Texas detention camp was homicide, according to a recording shared with the Washington Post. When ICE announced the death of Geraldo Lunas Campos on Jan. 3, it gave no cause of death. But “according to an eyewitness account and an internal ICE document reviewed by The Post,” Lunas Campos died following a struggle with detention staff. The new recording suggests he died from “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.”

ICE relied on AI to process thousands of new applications but an error caused the agency to wrongly categorize many of the new applicants as having law enforcement experience when they’d actually had none. “A DHS spokesperson called it a ‘technological snag’ that was quickly rectified,” Julia Ainsley reports for NBC News.

The deputy director of ICE announced on Thursday that she’s stepping down to run for office in Ohio. Madison Sheahan, 28, said she would enter the Republican primary race to oppose Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur. Reid J. Epstein and Madeleine Ngo report for the New York Times.

ICE’s principal legal adviser will replace Sheahan as the No. 2 at ICE. Charles Wall, who began his career with ICE as an assistant chief counsel in Louisiana in 2012, will become the new deputy director, Reuters reports.

Maine officials told residents on Wednesday that they were expecting federal immigration authorities to arrive in the state in the coming days. ICE agents are expected in the cities of Lewiston and Portland, according to the mayors there. Ashleigh Fields report for The Hill.

IRAN

After encouraging Iranians to take to the streets and declaring “help is on its way” on Wednesday, Trump appears to have backed off the idea of striking Iran. On Thursday, he said “very important sources on the other side” had told him the killing inside the country had stopped, surprising some of his own officials. His statement prompted speculation that the president could be attempting misdirection, similar to the lead up to U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June. Kevin Liptak, Zachary Cohen, Alayna Treene, Kristen Holmes report for CNN.

On Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked Trump to postpone any plans for an American military attack. Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt also asked the administration to hold off on any U.S. military operation, saying it could cause wider regional conflict. Edward Wong, Tyler Pager, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

On Thursday, Iran reopened its airspace after Trump’s comments about the killing having stopped. However, European airlines are still choosing not to fly over the country. Reuters reports.

Iran’s judiciary said it “had not issued a death sentence for Erfan Soltani, 26, a protester whose execution had been widely reported as imminent and had drawn intense international attention,” Abdi Latif Dahir and Sanam Mahoozi report for the New York Times.

The director of Israel’s Mossad spy agency is in the United States to discuss the situation in Iran. David Barnea is expected to “meet in Miami with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, who is managing the direct channel of communication between the U.S. and Iran,” Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

VENEZUELA

María Corina Machado, Venezuela’s opposition leader, met with Trump at the White House on Thursday and gave him her Nobel Peace Prize, which she won last year. After a large-scale U.S. military operation removed Venezuela’s longtime leader Nicolás Maduro from power earlier this month, Trump declined to replace him with Machado. Instead, he elevated other members of the Maduro regime into leadership positions. “It is unclear what Ms. Machado gained out of her meeting with Mr. Trump,” Max Bearak and Henrik Pryser Libell report for the New York Times.

While Machado met with Trump, CIA Director John Ratcliffe was in Caracas meeting with Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president of Venezuela. A U.S. official told the New York Times Ratcliffe’s meeting with Rodríguez was at Trump’s direction and it was meant “to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship.”

On Thursday, U.S. forces in the Caribbean seized a sixth sanctioned oil tanker that the Trump administration said has ties to Venezuela. The U.S. military said the ship was seized “without incident.” Konstantin Toropin and Michael Biesecker report for the AP.

The new leadership in Venezuela promised last week to release an “important number” of political prisoners, but their families say they are still waiting. The Venezuelan government claims several hundred have been released, but “Foro Penal, a leading rights organization that tracks and advocates for Venezuelan prisoners, says 79 had been released as of Wednesday night. An estimated 800 to 900 political prisoners were believed to have been incarcerated in Venezuela at the time of Maduro’s capture.” Mariana Zuñiga and Carmen Sesin report for NBC News.

The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil was to Vitol, “a company whose senior oil trader donated to Trump’s re-election campaign and attended a White House meeting with the president last week.” Malcolm Moore and Jamie Smyth report for the Financial Times.

GREENLAND

European troops arrived in Greenland on Thursday as Trump continued to threaten U.S. annexation of the Danish territory. “Small numbers of military personnel from France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway and Sweden were arriving in the Arctic island early Thursday,” Yuliya Talmazan reports for NBC News.

Two new polls show that most Americans oppose Trump’s threats to take over Greenland. “Eighty-six percent of voters nationwide questioned in a Quinnipiac University poll said they would oppose military action to take over Greenland.” And “three-quarters of Americans questioned in a CNN poll conducted at the same time said they opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland.” Paul Steinhauser reports for FOX News.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers were set to introduce a resolution on Thursday that would repudiate Trump’s threats to seize Greenland. The effort was led by Sens. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Reps. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Don Bacon (R-NE). Joe Gould reports for POLITICO.

CHINA

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is on a landmark state visit to Beijing, where on Friday it was announced that “Canada will lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles and China will do the same for Canadian canola products.” Carney announced on X that “Canada and China are forging a new strategic partnership.” Canada’s shift in trade policy comes after Trump has repeatedly threatened Canadian sovereignty. “The tariff changes Mr. Carney announced were modest, but they signal an important break with the United States as Canada seeks to urgently diversify its trading partners and reduce its reliance on the United States,” Matina Stevis-Gridneff reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY

The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Thursday that Taiwan will invest $250 billion in U.S. chipmaking under a new trade deal. In exchange, the United States will lower its tariff rate on Taiwan, bringing it down to 15 percent. It will also commit to zero “reciprocal” tariffs on certain goods, including generic pharmaceuticals. Kif Leswing reports for CNBC.

The United States is stepping up its pressure on Mexico to allow U.S. forces, either Special Operation troops or C.I.A. officers, to conduct joint operations to dismantle fentanyl labs inside the country. The country’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, opposes the idea of sending U.S. troops across the border. ​​Maria Abi-Habib, Julian E. Barnes, Eric Schmitt, and Tyler Pager report for the New York Times.

U.S. PRESS DEVELOPMENTS

The Pentagon announced on Thursday that it is overhauling the historically editorially independent newspaper Stars and Stripes. “The statement appears to challenge the editorial independence of Stars and Stripes, which while a part of the Pentagon’s Defense Media Activity has long retained independence from editorial oversight from the Pentagon under a congressional mandate that it be governed by First Amendment principles.” Corey Dickstein reports for Stars and Stripes.

After the FBI raided a Washington Post reporter’s home on Wednesday, journalists from multiple outlets are taking new precautions to protect their reporting. “Many journalists said they saw the FBI raid as a jarring new step aimed at limiting news organizations’ ability to gather information that the government does not want to be made public.” Sarah Ellison, Patrick Marley and Colby Itkowitz report for the Washington Post.

Staffers at CBS News expressed their concern and skepticism when the newsroom cited two anonymous “U.S. officials” on Wednesday to report that the ICE officer who fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis “suffered internal bleeding to the torso” after the incident. Jeremy Barr reports for the Guardian.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Elon Musk’s company X said it had disabled, “in some locations, a controversial Grok tool that allows users to digitally undress photos of real people,” but the tool remains functional on the stand-alone Grok app. Karla Adam, Faiz Siddiqui, and Tatum Hunter report for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal judge said on Thursday that Trump Cabinet secretaries had conspired to violate the Constitution. “In remarks laced with outrage and disbelief, U.S. District Judge William Young said Donald Trump and top officials have a ‘fearful approach’ to freedom of speech that would seek to ‘exclude from participation everyone who doesn’t agree with them.’” Young was appointed to the federal bench by President Ronald Reagan. Joanna Slater reports for the Washington Post.

At a different court hearing, the Trump administration admitted it had made a mistake when it deported Any Lucia López Belloza, 19, a freshman at Babson College, when she was flying home for Thanksgiving. Still, the government has not moved to drop the case, Adam Sella reports for the New York Times.

A federal appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that released Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration jail. “In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that federal immigration laws require deportation challenges to be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court — not a lower-level district court.” The Associated Press reports.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/GettyImages-73086221-1-e1512768873185.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:59:28.397238

Snowballs arcing toward ranks of men armored in tactical gear. Protesters gleefully dumping water to make streets even more hazardous.

If there is a third character in the story of immigration agents versus protesters in Minnesota, it is the January weather.

This weekend, temperatures in Minneapolis are expected to plunge even lower, to around zero degrees, an Arctic blast that could hinder the Trump administration’s continuing immigration crackdown and the angry demonstrations over the death of Renee Good, 37.

Local and state officials in Minnesota are anxiously watching the forecast. In daily meetings this week, they have shared information on planned protests and gatherings, news conferences, arrests and unrest. Without exception, the weather is on the list, and though officials are reluctant to say it publicly, they are quietly hoping for a few days of brutal cold.

That could calm residents in a city whose nerves are collectively frayed, city and state leaders reason, and make it harder for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to make arrests and disrupt life in Minneapolis any further.

But bundled-up residents who have been protesting for days said that a seriously cold stretch would play only to their advantage.

“I want it to get cold,” said Chris Foreman, a military veteran who has joined protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, just outside Minneapolis, for six days in a row. “People know that a lot of these ICE guys are from the South. They’re coming into a different environment and they’re not used to it.”

On Thursday, Mr. Foreman saw a man in his 60s toss a bucket of water onto the road in front of the Whipple building, where ICE vehicles zip in and out all day.

“What’s the prank you do to your friends in the winter in Minnesota? You throw a bucket of water on their stoop,” Mr. Foreman said. “We’re playing off of the joke.”

Minneapolis is unusually icy — literally — at the moment. Walking on sidewalks is treacherous, as an immigration agent in a viral video learned this week. Patches of black ice on residential streets are sending cars skidding.

Some of the ice is created by protesters: At a demonstration this week, protesters slowly drove a car outside the Whipple building with its hatch wide open, revealing several open jugs rigged to stream water into the street. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said the act could “potentially kill” federal agents by causing them to crash their vehicles.

On Friday afternoon, snow began to fall sideways, pelting pedestrians and bicyclists with big, icy, wet flakes.

Protesters who are originally from Minnesota say that they are ready with the proper winter gear. Standing outside at demonstrations, they wear woolen socks, double layers of long sleeves and tights, and sometimes ski goggles for a little extra warmth or insulated bibs from Carhartt that might look more fitting in an ice fishing shanty.

To avoid taking a nasty fall on an icy sidewalk, many Minnesotans have been wearing crampons or microspikes that strap onto the soles of their boots. At Nicollet Hardware in Minneapolis, protesters have been snapping them up from a display in the front of the store.

There is also the experience factor, a lifetime of acclimation.

“Our bodies are just ready for it,” said Jason Chavez, a City Council member who was born and raised in Minneapolis. “People here in Minnesota are strong and resilient and they know how to take on the weather. They are able to be outside for a long time.”

But Mr. Chavez said he was not rooting for a blizzard or a cold snap. If a snow emergency is declared, city rules require residents to move their cars to allow snowplows to get through, an inconvenience that would force people outside — and perhaps into the clutches of federal agents.

“At the beginning of this, I was like, ‘I hope it snows a lot,’” he said of the ICE crackdown. But now, he added, “I’m not sure if the weather hurts us or helps us.”

Outside the Whipple building on Friday, Jalyn Strain, wearing sturdy boots and a plaid scarf wrapped around her face, walked around with a jug of Dunkin’ coffee, offering it to protesters who needed to warm up. Most people politely declined.

“It’s not that cold yet,” she said, as the snow began to fall and the temperature hovered around 25 degrees. “People are used to being outside, going out and skiing. We’d be outside anyway.”

Jeremy Kalin, a former state representative and lawyer from Minneapolis who used to work outside in the cold, said it takes more than just experience to know how to endure Minnesota in January.

“You have to live through these winters to build the kind of resilience it takes to know how to stomach the cold — and how many layers of clothing go where,” he said, adding that if temperatures plunge further, the early mornings could be especially tough for ICE agents unaccustomed to the cold.

“I doubt they know what’s coming at them,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/nat-minnesota-cold-slip-qpbg/nat-minnesota-cold-slip-qpbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:59:00.528320

Subzero Arctic air headed to the Twin Cities this weekend could quell some of the tension — at least temporarily.","President Trump's threat to deploy federal troops to Minneapolis comes as the city is already in turmoil, with daily demonstrations, school disruptions, and fear running through immigrant communities and beyond amid the government's immigration crackdown.

Why it matters: The unprecedented ICE surge has the hallmarks of an occupation in some neighborhoods, as masked and heavily armed agents drive around in large SUVs, tussle with protesters and observers, and break into people's cars and houses to make arrests.

Driving the news: ""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,"" Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social.

Trump's immigration crackdown is tied in part to allegations of widespread fraud in Minnesota involving Somali residents. According to U.S. Census figures, of the more than 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota, about 4,200 are not U.S. citizens, per PBS.

A few hours after Trump's post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) made a ""direct appeal"" to Trump to ""turn the temperature down.""

""Stop this campaign of retribution,"" Walz said in a statement. ""This is not who we are.""

And to Minnesotans, he said: ""I know this is scary. We can — we must — speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully. We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That's what he wants.""

The latest: Tensions ratcheted up Wednesday after a confrontation in North Minneapolis, where U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said a federal agent shot a man following an attack with a snow shovel and broom.

DHS' account has not been independently verified.

That followed last week's killing of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother shot in her vehicle by an ICE officer, bringing global attention to the agency's actions in the city.

Zoom in: Minneapolis' Lake Street corridor — the same area that burned during the 2020 unrest over the police murder of George Floyd, and just a few blocks from where Good was killed — has been an epicenter of ICE activity.

The area's Midtown Global Market is usually a buzzy hub for immigrant-owned businesses and customers, but several vendors have closed shop with their customers afraid to leave home.

Longtime vendor Manny's Tortas is suffering a 40% decline in business, owner Manny González tells Axios. He said it's worse than 2020, and he won't last another month like this.

School districts with big Latino populations are reporting a sharp drop in attendance amid similar fears.

Minneapolis and St. Paul schools are offering remote learning for families who don't feel safe sending their kids outside.

Spanish immersion day care centers have cut their hours and asked parents to keep their kids home if possible.

What we're watching: A massive network of observers is trailing immigration agents around the Twin Cities, standing watch near immigrant businesses and alerting potential ICE targets with whistles and car horns.

These observers have recorded agents repeatedly kneeing a detainee in the face and dragging a woman from her vehicle as she said she was trying to get to a doctor's appointment, among other clips that have gone viral nationally and beyond.

By the numbers: Homeland Security says it has arrested 2,500 people in Minnesota since Nov. 29, including 13 gang members.

A Fox 9 analysis showed that 103 of those arrested are violent criminals. DHS has not said how many have been deported, charged or released.

Between the lines: While raids are happening across the Twin Cities area, life remains mostly normal in many neighborhoods and suburbs.

What's next: An abnormally warm January so far has made both immigration enforcement and protesting more tenable.

“It feels a bit like a pressure cooker over here,” Eau Claire City Council President Emily Berge said Friday in an interview with WPR’s “Wisconsin Today.”

The Trump administration has surged some 2,000 federal agents in the Twin Cities, with plans to add 1,000 more. Many of them are agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and protests have broken out over their aggressive enforcement tactics. Those protests have intensified since an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Macklin Good in her car last week. On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security said an ICE agent had shot a man in the leg in an enforcement action.

In Wisconsin border communities including Hudson, many people make daily commutes to the Twin Cities for work, shopping or recreation. A Hudson resident who asked to remain anonymous over safety concerns said she has been involved in organizing to support protesters in the area. She said people all across the metro area have been making sure protesters and organizers have rides, are fed and are safe.

But the psychological effects of the unrest have been widespread. She said some of the students at the elementary school where she teaches are afraid to come to class.

“It is just the saddest thing to see tiny children who are just starting school have this kind of fear and uncertainty,” she said.

That echoes the experience of others in immigrant communities.

“Everybody is terrified,” immigration attorney Marc Christopher told “Wisconsin Today.” “They see what’s been broadcast on TV. They see the indiscriminate arrest of people. … The level of fear and anxiety in our immigrant community is off the charts.”

And Berge, who is also a Democratic candidate for Congress, said people in the Hmong community worry they will be targeted for being members of a minority group, regardless of legal status.

“Even though they’re American citizens,” she said, “they have to bring their documents with them, their passports or ID with them when they leave the house — even to walk their dog or bring their kids to school.”

In an interview with PBS Wisconsin’s “Here and Now,” GOP U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson placed the blame for the unrest squarely on Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other politicians he said were “inciting people to resist and obstruct justice.”

Local officials respond to rumors, concerns about ICE enforcement

With attention focused on Minneapolis, unfounded rumors of ICE agents staging or planning large-scale operations in Wisconsin spread widely on social media. Officials in Baldwin, Wausau and Stevens Point all told WPR that social media chatter was false.

Still, officials in many communities have felt pressure to review policies and plans should federal immigration enforcements scale up.

The Hudson School District this week sent a message to parents reiterating its visitors policy and how district officials work with law enforcement.

Superintendent Nick Ouellette said there is not a separate policy for ICE, nor any branch of law enforcement.

“We’re not taking a political side of the argument,” Ouellette said. “We’re just saying this is how we handle things.”

If a district employee is approached on school property by a federal agent requesting information about a student or the student’s family, district policy and federal law prohibit the employee from sharing any student information without a valid judicial warrant or subpoena.

This includes confirming whether a student is enrolled at the school or within the district.

The Hudson School District serves about 5,000 students. Ouellette said it does not keep records of students who are not U.S. citizens.

The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.","WASHINGTON — The first year of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House was defined by clashes with the judiciary branch, as the president and his administration pushed forward with an aggressive immigration agenda.

In the past year, the Trump administration has aimed to drastically change immigration policy in the United States, including by stripping millions of immigrants of their legal status and attempting to redefine the constitutional right of birthright citizenship.

The moves have often run directly against the judiciary branch.

Federal judges briefly stalled the Trump administration’s plans to deploy the National Guard in Portland, Oregon, for immigration enforcement. They also blocked the invocation of an archaic wartime law to expel immigrants from the country — a move that raised concerns, all the way up to the Supreme Court, about skirting the due process rights of immigrants.

In response, the president for the last year frequently battled with federal judges, such as in June, when the Justice Department sued all judges in federal court in Maryland over a two-day pause in deportations to ensure due process rights for immigrants.

Trump also fixated on certain judges that put his policies on hold, such as the District of Columbia’s Chief Judge James Emanuel Boasberg.

Boasberg blocked the Trump administration from deporting certain immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and ordered the return of deportation flights that, despite his restraining order, still landed at a brutal prison in El Salvador.

Trump’s singling out of Boasberg in late March, and calling for his impeachment, prompted a rare rebuke from conservative Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.

But the Supreme Court has often handed wins to the Trump administration on numerous emergency appeals. The high court allowed for deportations of immigrants to countries they have no ties to, referred to as third-country removals, and allowed the use of race in immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

The president has found himself at odds with a range of groups in response to his harsh immigration policy.

A group of Quakers sued the Department of Homeland Security after officials removed a so-called sensitive locations policy that limited immigration enforcement in places of worship.

The Trump administration also faced backlash in its attempt to quickly deport Guatemalan children in the middle of the night, where a Trump nominated judge said the Department of Justice’s arguments for the move “crumbled like a house of cards.”

Out of the dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, here are the five most significant court cases related to the president’s immigration policies:

Alien Enemies Act

Last March, two deportation planes carrying immigrants removed under an 18th-century wartime law were ordered to return to the U.S. by Boasberg, chief judge for the District Court for the District of Columbia.

But the planes still landed in El Salvador, and 137 Venezuelan men were sent to a brutal prison known as CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The wartime law would apply to any Venezuelan national 14 and older who was suspected of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang.

Boasberg then spent months probing whether Trump officials defied his order to turn the planes around. Last month, he concluded that the deportations were illegal and carried out in defiance of his order.

The 137 Venezuelan men were eventually released from CECOT last summer through a prisoner exchange. Boasberg determined that even though the men are no longer imprisoned, they still need to be afforded their due process rights and he ordered the Trump administration to propose a way to afford those due process rights.

In the latest major development, last month he directed the administration to create a plan on how to do that, such as providing some form of video interview before an immigration judge.

The Trump administration has argued because of the U.S. military operations to extract Venezuela's president from the county, the situation is fluid, and they cannot provide a timeline for complying with Boasberg's order from last month.

The Justice Department’s most recent filing, from Jan. 12, objects to the court's order to facilitate remote due process hearings, and “given the current political instability in Venezuela, there is a serious risk of intentional interference with remote proceedings.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio also submitted a Jan. 12 declaration to the court, saying that “introducing the matter of the disposition of the 137 class members into these discussions at this time would risk material damage to U.S. foreign policy interests in Venezuela.”

He added that the U.S. does not know where the 137 Venezuelan men are.

“Given the passage of time, the U.S. government does not know—nor does it have any way of knowing—the whereabouts of class members, including whether anyone has departed Venezuela or whether the regime subsequently took anyone back into custody,” Rubio said.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia

The wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant and longtime Maryland man, cast a national spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

Abrego Garcia’s case has highlighted the Trump administration's appetite for mass deportations. The case started last March in the District Court of the District of Maryland, after Trump officials mistakenly removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite removal protections placed by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was likely Abrego Garcia would face violence if returned to his home country.

But in March, Abrego Garcia was placed on a plane, along with Venezuelans removed under the Alien Enemies Act, to the brutal El Salvador mega-prison known as CECOT.

Federal Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, but the Trump administration took the issue all the way to the Supreme Court, arguing that it could not force another government to comply with the U.S.

The Supreme Court sided with Abrego Garcia, but stopped short of ordering his return.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. several months later to face a criminal indictment in Tennessee over allegations of human smuggling. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges, and another federal judge has found cause that the Justice Department brought the indictment in a vindictive move against Abrego Garcia.

Since his return, Abrego Garcia has detailed psychological and physical torture he experienced at CECOT. The Trump administration has also tried to remove him to a country to which he has no ties because of the 2019 removal protections.

Trump officials re-detained Abrego Garcia and have tried to remove him to the African nations of Eswatini, Ghana, Uganda and Liberia, despite Costa Rica’s willingness to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and his willingness to go.

For that reason, Xinis ordered Abrego Garcia’s release from an ICE facility in Pennsylvania and barred the Trump administration from re-detaining him.

She is currently overseeing Abrego Garcia’s challenge to his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal.

A Jan. 14 hearing was the most recent development in Abrego Garcia’s case.

There, Xinis briefly conferred with his lawyers and Department of Justice attorneys regarding the timing of a final order of removal for Abrego Garcia was issued — the question was whether it was in 2019 or January 2025.

The timing of the order of removal could determine whether the Trump administration can re-detain Abrego Garcia for removal. Xinis in December ordered Abrego Garcia’s release, because she determined the Trump administration was unlawfully detaining him and said ICE failed repeatedly to show a final order of removal existed.

Xinis said she plans to make a final decision in Abrego Garcia’s case by Feb. 12.

Birthright Citizenship

One of Trump’s first executive orders he signed on Inauguration Day was ending the constitutional right to birthright citizenship.

Under birthright citizenship, all children born in the United States are considered citizens, regardless of their parents’ legal status. There is a small carve-out for the children born of diplomats.

If birthright citizenship were to be eliminated, more than 250,000 children born each year would not be granted U.S. citizenship and it would effectively create a class of 2.7 million stateless people by 2045, according to a recent study by the think tank the Migration Policy Institute.

In response to Trump’s executive order, multiple lawsuits were filed and lower courts across the country have granted preliminary injunctions against the order.

One of the challenges to birthright citizenship, brought by Democratic attorneys general, made its way to the Supreme Court, but the Trump administration asked the justices to weigh in on the issue of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts, rather than the merits of birthright citizenship.

The justices decided on an order that limited nationwide injunctions, such as class action suits.

The merits of birthright citizenship are now before the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear oral arguments in February.

That birthright citizenship case is Barbara v. Trump, which stems from a case in New Hampshire. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction to bar the executive order from taking effect against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025. Those children would have been denied citizenship under the president's executive order.

Lawmakers’ Access to ICE Facilities

As the Trump administration continues with aggressive immigration enforcement and detention, one of the few tools Democrats have, as the minority party, is oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.

More than 60,000 immigrants are detained across various ICE facilities in the country, and Democrats argue they need access to conduct oversight at the facilities. Under a 2019 appropriations law, any lawmaker can carry out an unannounced visit at a federal facility that holds immigrants.

But after several Democrats were denied access to ICE facilities in July, due to a policy instituted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that required seven days notice, a dozen House Democrats sued.

Last month, a federal judge granted the lawmakers' request to stay the new policy by Noem. But after Minnesota lawmakers said they were denied an oversight visit to an ICE facility following a deadly shooting by an immigration officer in Minneapolis, Democrats were back in court Jan. 14.

Noem required a seven-day notice, nearly identical to the policy that initially prompted the suit from Democrats last year.

The federal judge handling the case, Jia Cobb, is probing whether the Trump administration has violated her court order.

Democrats who sued include: Joe Neguse of Colorado, Adriano Espaillat of New York, Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Robert Garcia of California, J. Luis Correa of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Veronica Escobar of Texas, Dan Goldman of New York, Jimmy Gomez of California, Raul Ruiz of California, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and Norma Torres of California.

Expanded Use of Expedited Removal

A pillar of the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign is the expanded use of expedited removal. The Trump policy allows the removal of immigrants through the interior of the country without an appearance before an immigration judge.

In March, immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration over the policy, arguing it stripped due process rights of immigrants.

In August, the District Court for the District of Columbia issued a stay in the policy, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from using it. The Department of Justice appealed, and in September a panel of appellate judges denied the Trump administration’s request to lift the lower courts’ stay.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/abregogarciaaug25.JPG?h=9f66a723&itok=m-qZbdD7,N,,2026-01-16 16:59:23.372204

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer Brian Palacios shot Keith Porter Jr. late on Dec. 31 at a Northridge apartment complex, according to a sworn declaration submitted by attorney Michelle Diaz in a custody dispute between Palacios’ girlfriend and her ex-husband, which was made public Thursday. The document alleges that Palacios is the shooter “based on information and belief,” citing records and testimony identifying him as an ICE agent who lives in the complex.

A review of court transcripts, proof of service documents and motions related to the custody battle shows Palacios is an ICE agent and confirms that he lives in a unit at the Village Pointe Apartments. The unit number reflects an apartment that is just a short distance from the location where neighbors say Porter was killed.

An attorney for Palacios claimed the child abuse allegations were unfounded and denied that he made any racist remarks. “He acted in self defense and he was being shot at that night,” said the attorney, Stacie Halpern.

No one answered the door at the apartment listed for Palacios on Friday.

Friends and advocates say Porter — a 43-year-old Compton native and father of two — was firing a gun into the air to celebrate the new year on the night of his death.

Tricia McLaughlin, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary of public affairs, initially said a suspected “active shooter” was killed following an exchange of gunfire with an off-duty ICE agent. In her statement, McLaughlin said the agent “bravely responded to an active shooter situation at his apartment complex.”

McLaughlin did not immediately address questions about the agent’s identity and the allegations against him in response to an inquiry from The Times.

Los Angeles police said no one else was injured in the incident. An LAPD spokesman declined to comment.

Jamal Tooson, an attorney for Porter’s family, said in a statement: “Should this individual be confirmed as the person responsible for Keith’s death, based on his deeply disturbing past allegations it is unimaginable that any human being with a conscience on this earth could regard him as a hero.”

A spokesperson for the L.A. County district attorney’s office declined to confirm or deny that Palacios was the off-duty agent responsible for the shooting and said the incident is under investigation by the Justice System Integrity Division, which investigates killings by law enforcement officers.

A meeting of the Los Angeles Police Commission was packed last week with angry activists and residents, many of whom called for authorities to release the ICE agent’s name. Although the names of LAPD officers involved in fatal use-of-force incidents are normally made public within weeks, there is no such rule for federal agencies.

Court records filed last year in the custody dispute repeatedly describe Palacios as an “ICE officer” and “federal law enforcement officer.” An attorney for Palacios’ girlfriend said they lived together, according to a court transcript. The woman’s home address listed in court records is the same as the address for the Village Pointe complex.

The document filed this week sought to temporarily bar Palacios’ girlfriend from seeing her daughter from her first marriage, based on the potential danger posed by the ICE agent’s alleged involvement in the shooting.

“Palacios is presently prohibited by Court Order from being in the presence of the parties’ minor children because of his abusive conduct,” read the filing from Diaz, who represents the ex-husband of Palacios’ girlfriend. “There is a very valid concern that the stress of having shot and killed another man on 12/31/2025, and the ongoing aftermath, will materially and substantially impair Mother’s mental health, and impact her ability to provide a safe and stable parenting schedule for their youngest child.”

In an email to The Times, Diaz said she did not have direct knowledge that Palacios killed Porter but had reached that conclusion based on the evidence laid out in her court filing, including his living arrangements and his employment as an ICE agent. An attorney for Palacios’ girlfriend also confirmed that they lived together and that he is an ICE agent during a February 2025 court hearing, according to court records.

Emails attached to the filing show Diaz asked her client’s ex-wife if Palacios was the shooter, and the woman referred Diaz to a criminal defense attorney.

The fatal New Year’s Eve incident follows several others in recent weeks in which ICE agents have used deadly force against U.S. citizens.

Last week, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. President Trump and other federal officials have accused Good of obstructing immigration efforts and said she tried to hit Ross with her car, but cellphone video from the scene shows Good was trying to drive away and that Ross shot at her through the driver’s side window. The killing has drawn widespread condemnation and protests; Trump administration officials have staunchly defended the agent and accused Good of weaponizing her vehicle in “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Unlike the Minnesota incident, which was captured on multiple videos, no recordings have surfaced from the confrontation that led to Porter’s killing.

It remains unclear exactly what happened in Northridge around 10:40 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Palacios was off duty, so there is no body camera video. None of the building’s security cameras captured the shooting either, according to a message from the property management company.

Two law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, told The Times that Porter was found in possession of a rifle. One of those officials said investigators also found evidence of two bullet impacts behind where the agent would have been standing at the time of the shooting, which would support federal authorities claims that he was fired upon by Porter. The official also said the agent identified himself as law enforcement before opening fire.

Porter’s friends and family have argued he was firing a gun in the air to celebrate the new year. Los Angeles police officials have warned people against the practice for years, and doing so is a felony. Still, Porter’s supporters contend that the agent overreacted and should have waited for the LAPD to respond.

Last year, a Los Angeles County judge barred Palacios from being around his girlfriend’s children from a previous marriage in the wake of allegations that he had whipped his biological sons with a belt, according to a transcript of a 2025 hearing.

Through an attorney, the children also accused Palacios of using homophobic slurs and making racist remarks about Black and Latino people, according to a court transcript. Palacios also referred to the children’s biological father as an “illegal alien,” according to the allegations contained in court records.

Omar Escorcia, the ex-husband of Palacios’ girlfriend, told The Times that Palacios routinely made disparaging remarks about Latinos before and after custody hearings, referring to them as “wetbacks.” Palacios’ attorney denied her client made any such comments.

Escorcia also described an alleged incident in which Palacios showed up to a youth soccer game carrying a gun, which was visible to other parents and left several people upset and concerned for their kids’ safety.

“What law enforcement officer who is mindful of gun safety, shows up to a children’s sporting event with a gun that is not holstered, but stuck in their waistband, and they’re holding a toddler?” asked Escorcia’s attorney, Diaz, according to a transcript of a 2025 court hearing. “There are all kinds of red flags here.”

Palacios also threatened Escorcia’s son with violence, according to claims made by an attorney for the minors in multiple court filings.

“If you were my son, I would punch you in the chest the same way,” he told Escorcia’s son after striking one of his own children, the child’s attorney alleged, according to a transcript of a 2025 custody hearing.

The L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services opened an investigation, according to court records, but it was not clear what the results were. A DCFS spokeswoman said she was barred from answering questions about the incident by state law.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b7b7b2b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4964x2606+0+351/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa5%2Fe7%2F0ba8c48c4eaba58c9aa9aec75804%2F1536595-me-ice-agent-shooting-northridge-jja-0032.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 19:59:04.990507

As President and CEO Uzra Zeya said: “Over the past year, the authoritarian playbook the United States spent decades fighting overseas has come home to our shores, but it’s on steroids. From weaponizing government power to target perceived enemies and enrich cronies; to vilifying immigrants, LGBTQI+ people, women and girls, and communities of color; to purging nonpartisan public servants and smearing civil society; this administration is mirroring tactics long used by governments in Egypt, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, China, and India, among others.”

What sets the United States apart in this grim pantheon is not only the speed of democratic regression, but its scope. This underscores the urgency and importance of HRF’s integrated, multi-pronged response:

1) Protection Abandoned in Favor of Mass Detention and Deportation

Under the Trump administration, the U.S. asylum and refugee systems have been gravely undermined. People with pending asylum cases have been denied fair hearings, detained far from family and counsel, and in some cases disappeared to third countries. Since late November 2025, all asylum adjudications by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have been unjustifiably suspended, leaving thousands trapped in indefinite limbo. After U.S. refugee admissions reached their highest level in 30 years in 2024, the Trump administration sharply cut and restricted resettlement solely to white Afrikaners from South Africa last year—injecting racial discrimination into a historically bipartisan humanitarian program. HRF is defending resettled refugees with lawful status, including Hmong and Somali families, now being rounded up and threatened with deportation.

The administration has massively expanded detention through H.R.1, pouring over $170 billion into DHS. ICE’s detention budget has grown 265 percent—larger than the entire federal prison system—with capacity to detain up to 116,000 people daily. ICE now holds about 73,000 people, the largest detained immigrant population in its history. HRF co-led opposition to the most extreme proposals in this bill and continues to fight further funding increases.

HRF is documenting the deadly consequences. In 2025, at least 32 people died in ICE custody, with five more deaths in the first two weeks of 2026. We have exposed disappearances from custody and abusive conditions, including severe harm to children at the reopened Dilley family detention facility.

Through HRF’s ICE Flight Monitor, we documented a record 2,138 deportation flights to 79 countries, many carried out without due process. Our joint project with Refugees International—Banished by Bargain: Third Country Deportation Watch—exposed secretive deals concluded by the Trump administration with third-countries that have sent people to at least 14 countries where they face detention, torture, or refoulement. This includes transfers to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison and to maximum-security facilities in Eswatini and South Sudan, sometimes in defiance of court orders. HRF is challenging these practices in federal court, winning protection for individual clients, and working with global allies to condemn and stop these rights-violating schemes. In individual cases, HRF has blocked unlawful removals, including securing asylum for a Jewish Iranian man fleeing persecution, after the U.S. government imprisoned him for nine months tried to send him to multiple third countries.

We are also tracking widespread due process violations, including racial profiling, denial of hearings, and the wrongful detention of hundreds of U.S. citizens, among whom are Native Americans. Immigration judges have been mass terminated, further undermining the capacity and integrity of their role. At the same time, the administration has stripped over a million people of lawful status by ending TPS and humanitarian parole programs, which HRF is challenging in court, including securing an early restraining order blocking mass revocations and family separations.

2) Assaults on Democracy and the Constitution

HRF is advancing democracy protection in the United States through an integrated strategy that combines advocacy, litigation, and civic activism to counter ongoing authoritarian drift. At the core of this work is curbing militarization of U.S. cities and ICE overreach, while defending the right to dissent. We have done so by mobilizing national and local advocacy, elevating the voices of veterans to reinforce civilian control and military nonpartisanship, and pursuing strategic litigation to uphold constitutional protections, including free speech and the right to protest. At the same time, HRF is pushing for legislative reforms that protect freedom of peaceful assembly and free expression, and prevent abuse of military power. We are also developing tools to track and expose attacks on civic space, and building broad, bipartisan coalitions—across civil rights, faith, student, and veteran communities.

3) Repudiating International Law and Alliances

The Trump administration’s unfounded criticisms and attacks on democratic U.S. allies – including threats to illegally annex Greenland by force and interference in legitimate efforts in other countries to hold leaders to account – have encouraged extremists and produced turmoil in transatlantic relations and other alliances that underpin U.S. national security. Drastic funding cuts to civil society in Ukraine and elsewhere have undermined democracy and human rights in favor of kleptocrats worldwide. By flouting international law and turning against treaties and accountability institutions like the International Criminal Court, the administration is tearing down the pillars that uphold stability, peace, and prosperity.

HRF is confronting this authoritarian turn on multiple fronts—as co-counsel in litigation against third-country removals and political targeting, pressing for accountability before international bodies, and mobilizing a global defense of the Refugee Convention and human rights treaties and institutions, including an open letter signed by more than 300 organizations worldwide. We have successfully sued to keep international war crimes prosecutors on the job in spite of U.S. sanctions, and helped human rights defenders at the front lines of the war on Ukraine find alternative sources of funding following U.S. government cuts.

The Urgency of Now

The abuses documented here reflect an authoritarian project taking shape in real time. Immigrants and refugees are being used as test subjects for broader assaults on the Constitution, dissent is being criminalized, and international law is being dismantled piece by piece. HRF is standing at the front lines by defending people in court, mobilizing peaceful opposition that transcends partisan and regional divides, holding governments to account, and building broader coalitions needed to protect democracy at home and human rights around the world. The stakes could not be higher. HRF will continue to meet this moment with the urgency, independence, and resolve it demands.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-16 16:58:56.637864

Here, we summarize some of the most important recent developments in immigration policy on the federal, legal, state, and local levels.

Federal

Trump Threatens to Invoke Insurrection Act in Minnesota Amid Intensified Immigration Operations

President Trump threatened on January 15 to invoke the Insurrection Act in response to ongoing protests in Minneapolis. The Trump administration announced on January 12 that it was deploying approximately 1,000 additional Customs and Border Protection officers to Minnesota, expanding federal law enforcement presence beyond the 2,000 agents and officers already sent to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has described the operation as its largest immigration enforcement action to date. The deployment follows the January 8 fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Response Team officer. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated the additional officers will ensure safe operations for federal agents and warned that individuals who engage in “violent activities against law enforcement” or obstruct operations will face consequences.

Faith communities across the Twin Cities have mobilized in response to intensified enforcement. Congregations have posted “ICE Free Zone” signs at churches and community centers. Volunteers have been blowing whistles and honking horns as alerts when enforcement operations are underway in neighborhoods. Community members are driving immigrants to work to help them avoid public transportation where enforcement actions have occurred. Several hundred people participated in a recent vigil that wound through south Minneapolis near the site where Good was killed, pausing at locations where federal agents had recently detained people. Tensions between protesters and federal agents have been heightened in recent days, with demonstrations occurring on January 14 and 15 outside federal buildings and in neighborhoods where ICE operations have taken place, leading the federal officers to deploy tear gas and other crowd control devices.

Administration Suspends Immigrant Visa Processing from 75 Countries Under Expanded Public Charge Policy

The State Department announced on January 14 that it will pause immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries beginning January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations “utilize welfare resources from American taxpayers at unacceptable levels”. The suspension affects countries including Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Haiti, Somalia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Thailand, though the department did not disclose the specific percentage of immigrants from these nations who rely on public assistance. The pause applies only to immigrant visas for permanent residency and does not affect nonimmigrant visas for tourists, students, or business travelers, which represent the majority of visa applications.

The suspension follows the administration’s January 1 implementation of Presidential Proclamation 10998, which imposed visa restrictions on 39 countries, and represents a significant expansion of enforcement under the longstanding public charge inadmissibility provision. On November 19, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled “Public Charge Ground of Inadmissibility,” outlining major changes to how immigration officials assess whether certain immigrants are likely to become a “public charge”. The proposed rule seeks to rescind the 2022 public charge regulations, which DHS argued were “overly restrictive” and prevented officers from considering all relevant factors in determining whether an applicant might rely on public benefits. The visa pause will continue indefinitely until the State Department completes a reassessment of visa processing protocols.

DHS Announces Termination of TPS for Somalia as ICE Arrests Dozens of Resettled Refugees in Minnesota

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on January 13 that it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somalia, requiring approximately 2,400 Somali nationals with TPS to leave the United States by March 17, 2026, when the designation expires. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stated that “country conditions in Somalia have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status” and that allowing Somali nationals to remain is “contrary to our national interests”. The termination comes as DHS continues large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis, home to a significant Somali population, and as the administration has moved to end TPS for 11 countries total, affecting more than 1 million immigrants who will lose their protections by February.

Concurrently, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested dozens of resettled refugees in Minnesota, many of them Somali, and transferred them to detention facilities in Texas. The arrests followed an administration announcement that it would reexamine thousands of refugee cases through new background checks, focusing on refugees who entered legally but have not yet obtained green cards. Immigration attorneys estimate at least 100 people have been detained, including families with children and individuals who had already applied for permanent residency. The detained refugees passed extensive security screenings by the State Department, DHS, and other agencies before receiving invitations to resettle in the United States under the Refugee Admissions Program. Advocates note that while refugees are required to apply for green cards within a year of arrival, some delayed the process due to cost and bureaucratic hurdles, and historically have not faced arrest or deportation for the delay.

Administration Accelerates Installation of Migrant-Deterring Buoy Barriers in Texas

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began installing a 500-mile barrier of large floating buoys in the Rio Grande on January 7, expanding on a controversial Texas strategy that Governor Greg Abbott first deployed in 2023. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem announced during a January 8 visit to the Rio Grande Valley that 130 miles of the water barrier were already under contract and installation began that day. The floating barriers are part of President Trump’s “Smart Wall” strategy combining steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras, and detection technology, funded through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July 2025.

The buoys are anchored deep in the soil beneath the river to prevent people from swimming under them and include tamper devices to alert agents if someone breaches the barrier. Noem stated the barriers would deter illegal crossings and “save the lives of illegal aliens by deterring them from daring to attempt to cross through this treacherous water.” The expansion has drawn criticism from environmental activists concerned about access to nature along the Rio Grande, while Mexico previously complained that Texas’s original buoy deployment violated water treaties between the two countries. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has allowed Texas’s existing buoys to remain in place while litigation over the Biden administration’s lawsuit against the state moves forward in a lower court.

Senate Hearing Addresses Screening Processes for Afghan Parolees Following D.C. Shooting

On January 14, the Senate Subcommittee on Border Security and Immigration and the Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism held a joint hearing examining the Biden Administration’s Afghan parolee program. Inspectors General from the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), State (DoS), and Defense (DoD) testified and identified systemic weaknesses in evacuee vetting, tracking, and post-entry monitoring, noting that many audit recommendations remain open. The hearing also referenced 50 Afghan nationals already in the United States whose records indicated significant security concerns, such as latent fingerprints linked to improvised explosive devices (IEDs) or suspected terrorist associations, though the government has not publicly disclosed the current status of those individuals. In addition, DHS acknowledged difficulties tracking approximately 11,700 evacuees who departed military base safe havens without formal coordination.

Despite these concerns, several committee members emphasized that criminal activity among the roughly 77,000 Afghan parolees has been very low overall and reiterated that Afghan US allies should not be punished for the actions of a single individual. The recent shooting of two National Guardsmen was discussed but remains under active investigation, limiting public comment; it was noted that the alleged shooter entered through the parole program and was later granted asylum, and displayed possible indicators of declining mental health. Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) also raised allegations that more than $16 million in federal resettlement funds were directed to organizations alleged to have ties to terrorist groups and were not used for their intended purposes; those allegations remain subject to further review but were not substantively challenged during the hearing.

Legal

Minnesota and Illinois File Federal Lawsuits as Prosecutors Resign Over Response to Minneapolis Shooting

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, along with the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, filed a federal lawsuit on January 12 against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), asserting that the mass deployment of federal immigration officers violated the First and Tenth Amendments and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit claims the surge of agents has undermined public safety, strained municipal resources, and exceeded constitutional limits on federal power. Illinois and the city of Chicago filed a separate lawsuit the same day alleging dangerous tactics and unlawful use of force by ICE and Border Patrol agents. A federal judge denied Minnesota’s request for an immediate temporary restraining order during the first hearing in the case.

Separately, at least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned on January 13 amid pressure from Justice Department leadership to investigate Renee Good’s widow for alleged ties to activist groups. These resignations followed separate resignations by four top officials in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including the chief, principal deputy chief, deputy chief, and acting deputy chief, after division leadership announced it would not investigate the shooting. The resignations come amid reports that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is also examining Good’s possible ties to activist groups as part of its own inquiry into the shooting.

State and Local

ICE Detains New York City Council Employee at Routine Immigration Appointment

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Rafael Andres Rubio Bohorquez, a data analyst for the New York City Council, on January 12 while he attended a routine immigration appointment in Bethpage, Long Island. City Council Speaker Julie Menin stated that Rubio Bohorquez had legal authorization to remain and work in the United States until October, cleared standard background checks for city employment, and was doing everything required of him by appearing at his scheduled appointment. The New York Legal Assistance Group filed an emergency habeas petition challenging his detention, which prevented his removal from New York State pending court review.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) disputed the city’s characterization, with spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stating that Rubio Bohorquez entered the United States on a B visa in 2017 which required him to depart by July 22, 2017, had no legal right to remain in the country, was not authorized to work, and had a prior arrest for assault. Representative Dan Goldman (D-NY) countered that the employee had Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and subsequently obtained work authorization, calling DHS’s statement “a bald-faced lie”. City officials stated the employee provided documentation showing he was authorized under TPS and extended his work authorization even after President Trump terminated TPS for Venezuelans.

Much overlooked in the ongoing debate over immigration is the Trump administration’s termination of many different types of temporary protections and statuses. With hundreds of thousands of people losing protections and work authorization throughout 2025, addressing and clarifying these populations is important to understanding the risks faced by these once-protected individuals who no longer are able to legally work and may now face deportation.

In a time when mass deportation efforts threaten large numbers of noncitizens with arrest, detention, and removal, it is increasingly common for political actors to refer to those with temporary statuses as undocumented or “illegal.”[1] Given this circumstance, it is important to clarify that these hundreds of thousands of people have been legally admitted to the United States, and/or have been lawfully permitted to reside in the United States on a temporary basis across multiple administrations.

Recent actions by the Trump administration to end various temporary protections have impacted these group’s lawful presence and exposed these individuals to arrest, detention, and removal. Accordingly, this paper seeks to highlight some of these temporary statuses and discuss how immigrants are impacted when their previously lawful presence has been terminated.

What would qualify as “illegal” immigration?

Whether a noncitizen is referred to as “illegal,” “undocumented,” “unauthorized,” “lacking status,” or another term, this category of individuals without legal authorization continues to be a flashpoint in the immigration debate. While there is currently no single definition of “illegal” in this context, the term generally refers to either 1) individuals who entered the U.S. without authorization or 2) individuals who entered lawfully,[2] but no longer have lawful status.

Historically, most of the individuals in the second category have overstayed a visa. More recently, hundreds of thousands of individuals have found themselves in this second category after obtaining temporary presence that was later terminated by the current administration.

Humanitarian Parole

Humanitarian parole is a temporary and discretionary immigration designation, not to be confused with “parole” in the criminal law context, and is provided under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Humanitarian parole refers to the temporary and discretionary admission of a non-U.S. national into the United States for a limited period of stay. Under the INA, “the Secretary of Homeland Security can use their discretion to parole any noncitizen applying for admission into the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” Grants of humanitarian parole are assessed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on a case-by-case basis. Humanitarian parole is granted for a limited period of time, typically not longer than one year, but the period can be anywhere from 24 hours up to two years. Parole is often used for witnesses in court cases and for emergency evacuation situations because it is discretionary and provides the flexibility needed in an urgent situation.

The Biden administration used humanitarian parole expansively, often in novel and controversial ways. In response to conflicts overseas, the administration admitted tens of thousands of Afghans, as well as Ukrainians, the latter under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) parole program. The Biden administration also extensively used parole to help ease influxes and processing strains along the U.S. southern border, reducing the number of people coming to the southern border in an irregular manner through various programs like the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) parole program, the Keeping Families Together program, and temporarily admitting asylum seekers and others who utilized CBP One, a mobile app developed to enhance border processing and expedite entry.

In 2025, however, under the second Trump administration, many of these programs were either ended, allowed to lapse, or repurposed. For example, the CBP One app has been rebranded and is now used to help facilitate self-deportation. While humanitarian parole remains in place for discretionary use by the Trump administration, the tool has been used sparingly.

Although the Biden administration’s expansive use of humanitarian parole has at times been controversial, the result of its widespread use and subsequent termination is that hundreds of thousands of people who were temporarily paroled into the U.S. now find themselves without its protections. They are now out of status and at risk of arrest, detention, and deportation.

Temporary Protected Status

Temporary Protected Status (TPS) is a legal and temporary immigration status that was created in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 (INA). Under the law, the DHS Secretary is empowered to grant TPS to populations of foreign-born individuals who are unable to safely return to their home countries, due to situations such as military conflicts or national disasters. TPS is granted for six, twelve, or eighteen-month renewable periods, with DHS regularly reviewing country conditions to determine whether to extend or terminate a particular TPS grant based on current country conditions. If an extension is granted, it is done so at least 60 days before the expiration date. The extension decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of country conditions, and TPS is restricted to those who arrived before a “required arrival date.” This means that TPS holders must be physically present in the United States at the time of the TPS grant. Those who arrive in the U.S. after this date are not covered by the TPS grant.

It is important to note that TPS is available to individuals who meet its qualifications, regardless of their prior immigration status. That is, TPS protections apply to covered foreign nationals currently in the U.S. regardless of whether they were lawfully present, overstayed a visa, or entered unlawfully in the first place. However, TPS protection is only temporary – it is not a pathway to legal status or citizenship in the U.S. Longtime TPS holders are not able to adjust to lawful permanent resident status under the terms of TPS, regardless of how long they have resided in the U.S.

TPS can be extended indefinitely, and TPS protections for some populations have been in place for more than two decades. In 2025 and in the beginning of 2026, the Trump administration has regularly terminated or declined to renew TPS for countries including Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Honduras, Haiti, Nepal, Nicaragua, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Burma, and Somali. Some of these TPS terminations have been challenged in court and litigation remains pending as of early 2026. It is expected that most, if not all, of the remaining active TPS grants will be terminated or allowed to lapse by the Trump administration. Nationals from terminated countries represent hundreds of thousands of individuals, some of whom have been in the United States for decades, and who have now lost, or will shortly lose, their legal status – making them targets for arrest, detention, and deportation.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) is a temporary protection from removal based on the legal concept of deferred action. DACA was first established in 2012 by the Obama administration. It provides work authorization and protection from deportation to certain Dreamers, young people brought to the United States as children, who entered the U.S. before their 16th birthday and have lived in the U.S. since June 15, 2007. DACA must be renewed every two years. DACA does not provide a pathway to permanent lawful status or citizenship.

Since its creation, DACA has faced several legal challenges. Texas and other states litigated against DACA and blocked its expansion, and the first Trump administration unsuccessfully attempted to rescind the program, although it was successful in preventing new applicants from being considered for DACA protections. In 2022, in an attempt to fortify DACA, the Biden administration issued a new DACA rule which replaced the 2012 DACA policy. The 2012 DACA policy was subsequently found to be unlawful in litigation. The 2022 DACA rule was also challenged in court and is still being litigated. In 2025, the 5th Circuit issued a decision finding DACA’s protections from deportations to be a lawful application of prosecutorial discretion but providing DACA recipients with accompanying work authorization was inconsistent with federal law. DACA remains largely in place, with courts currently only looking to terminate work authorization for residents of Texas. The case is now back in federal district court, which is expected to issue a ruling on the future of the program.

The second Trump administration has yet to take action to terminate DACA, but the pending litigation has only added to the uncertainty DACA recipients face.

Refugee Protections

As reflected in the Refugee Act of 1980, a refugee is a person outside the country of his or her nationality, who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An individual who receives refugee status is granted permission to permanently resettle in the United States, including a pathway to LPR status and citizenship.

Refugees are lawfully admitted into the U.S. under a formal process involving extensive screening and vetting. The Department of State preliminarily approves a refugee application and then the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency within DHS, makes the final refugee status determination. Refugee status is a temporary status but, unlike many of the other statuses described above, it can lead to permanent status. A refugee is required to wait for one year but is then obligated to apply for LPR status. Refugee status is an indefinite status, so it is not automatically terminated if a refugee does not apply for LPR status. In rare cases of fraud or material misrepresentation during the application process, refugee status can be challenged in a formal proceeding that follows due process. These legal limitations in revoking refugee status have significant implications for the entire process USCIS has announced regarding the re-review of refugees who have already been resettled in the US.

In 2025, the Trump administration scaled back refugee protections. In November, USCIS issued an internal memo calling for the individual review of all the refugees who arrived between January 20, 2021, and February 20, 2025, and halted all processing of green card applications for refugees who entered during the same period. Such actions will have detrimental impacts on the refugee populations in the U.S. and could result in the removal of status for some refugees.

Asylum Seekers

Asylum seekers have garnered significant attention due to the multiple border influxes going back to 2013. Because hundreds of thousands of individuals seeking asylum have been encountered at the border, this status is most commonly part of discussions about border security and unlawful entry.

While most immigration-related offenses are civil offenses, federal law makes unlawful entry and reentry criminal offenses. Violations of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1325 and 1326 carry criminal penalties. Section 1325, enacted in 1929, makes it a misdemeanor for noncitizens to enter into the U.S. at unauthorized places or time, by evading examination, or entering by making false claims. Section 1326, enacted in 1952, makes unlawful reentry a felony, outlawing the practice of attempting to return and reenter the U.S. after being denied, removed, or deported. Violators of these laws risk fines and imprisonment, with § 1326 violations carrying higher penalties. For more than a decade, these two statutory violations have been among the most commonly-prosecuted federal crimes, carrying criminal penalties in addition to negative immigration consequences.

However, the criminal prohibition against unlawful entry and reentry bump up against the statutory right to seek asylum, created through treaty and enshrined in federal law by Congress. An asylee seeks to secure protection from persecution from inside the United States or at a U.S. border. An asylee is an individual who meets the same definition as a refugee – as detailed above.

Under the INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution for reason of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion have a right to seek protection from the U.S. government by applying for asylum within one year of their arrival-with limited exemptions. As the statute notes, they may seek protection “whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . . irrespective of such alien’s status.” Under the statute, “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and can do so either at ports of entry, between ports of entry, or after having arrived inside the U.S. Successful asylum seekers become asylees, who can pursue LPR status after one year of physical presence in the U.S. and eventual citizenship.

Under federal law, those eligible for asylum are permitted to remain in the United States to pursue their claims and can receive an employment authorization document (EAD) after 180 days. If denied asylum, work authorization terminates at the time the EAD expired or 60 days after the denial of the asylum application – whichever is later.

In tension with this framework, the Trump administration has placed significant restrictions on individuals seeking asylum at ports of entry and, more recently, halted processing of affirmative asylum claims. These actions, alongside other actions that limit access to humanitarian relief and reduce the validity period of work authorizations, will have a negative impact on current and future asylum seekers.

Relevant to this discussion of lawfulness and status, the intersection of sections 1325, 1326 and 1158 lay out the complex set of protections for those seeking asylum after an otherwise unlawful entry or reentry. In short, while longstanding federal criminal prohibitions exist for irregular entry or reentry into the United States, federal law also allows those fleeing persecution to seek asylum regardless of their status or method of entry. And federal law provides that asylum seekers can remain in the United States to pursue their claims and seek work authorization. As the Trump administration takes steps to limit access to asylum and the duration of work authorizations, the temporary protections afforded to asylum seekers become increasingly relevant to this conversation.

Conclusion

Although they all too often get mischaracterized in the debate over “illegal immigration,” temporary protections and statuses related to humanitarian parole, TPS, DACA, refugees, and asylum afford lawful presence and protections to those who possess them.

Given this context, it is important to consider the role of these temporary protections and statuses and recognize that hundreds of thousands of people have only recently seen, or may soon see, their lawful presence terminated due to current Trump administration policy changes. In many instances, strong policy considerations exist for affording these protections in the first place and removing them without careful consideration leads to significant harm, especially for those now faced with arrest or deportation. Going forward it is essential that policymakers share a common understanding of these concepts in order to finally advance the permanent legislative reforms needed to fix our broken immigration system.

Wax told the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday that the district court improperly relied on Penn’s characterization of “hotly disputed facts” in disciplinary reports about her controversial statements concerning race and defined retaliation too narrowly when it dismissed her claims.

Wax, who is white, sued the university in January 2025, alleging Penn violated her tenure rights in October 2024 when it suspended her from teaching for one year with half pay following an investigation into public statements she made about minority groups that many deemed racist.

Senior U.S. District Judge Timothy Savage in Philadelphia dismissed the case in August, calling her racial bias claims “implausible.”

A Penn spokesperson declined to comment on Wax’ appeal. Wax, who has denied allegations of racism, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. She has previously defended her right to hold unpopular opinions about race and referred to herself as a ""casualty in the culture wars.”

Wax's attorney, Jason Torchinsky of law firm Holtzman Vogel, said he and his client hope the Third Circuit ""see the law the same way we do.""

A social welfare law and policy scholar who has taught at UPenn’s law school since 2001, Wax has clashed for years with administrators. Students and faculty first called for her firing in 2017, after she co-authored a newspaper opinion piece arguing that Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior.

The law school in 2018 banned Wax from teaching required first-year courses after she said on a podcast that she had never seen a Black law student graduate in the top quarter of his or her class, and rarely in the top half.

In 2022, Wax wrote a blog post saying the United States is “better off with fewer Asians and less Asian immigration” as long as most Asians vote for Democrats. UPenn law dean Ted Ruger asked the university’s faculty senate to impose a “major sanction” against her for her statements.

Wax said in her brief to the appeals court that Penn employs a ""race-based double standard"" in disciplinary procedures and academic freedom protections, arguing that she was punished more harshly while the university overlooked similar conduct by racial minorities.

She separately sued the university a second time in Pennsylvania state court in November, alleging the university violated her academic freedom when it sanctioned her over controversial statements about race. That case is on hold pending her federal appeal.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has grown its network of private industry partners since the start of the second Trump administration to support its agents as they storm into cities and detain people they suspect of being undocumented immigrants.

Last year, the ICE agency obligated more money than ever to private contractors, and this year it’s on pace to easily top last year’s record. More than 600 companies have been working with Trump’s ICE, including businesses in nearly every state.

Using USAspending.gov data, Sludge created an interactive map that shows every company in the U.S. that has either entered into a new contract with ICE during the second Trump administration or has been awarded new obligations under an existing contract. Click on the map for details including amounts and contract service descriptions.

Since President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, ICE has approved contract obligations totaling $5.2 billion. While most of ICE’s contracting dollars go to large prison and technology companies, the agency's network of private-sector partners extends across the country and spans a wide range of industries. Nearly every state is home to ICE contractors, including companies with million dollar-plus contracts that operate out of unexpected locations like suburban neighborhoods or rural areas.

Almost two-thirds of ICE’s spending obligations so far under Trump’s second term have gone to just seven companies. The top recipient has been ​​Albuquerque-based CSI Aviation, ICE’s main contractor for deportation flights, which has received more than $1.2 billion in contract obligations. CSI Aviation, which hosted a rally for Trump days before the 2024 election, has seen its ICE revenue soar since the start of last year—around a 10x increase compared with May, before the passage of the Trump-GOP reconciliation bill.

GEO Group, the largest private prison operator in the country, has received $683.4 million worth of contract obligations since Trump reentered the White House, and another prison company CoreCivic has received $269 million. The companies’ stock prices rose last year under a $45 billion plan in the Trump-signed ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)"" to expand ICE’s detention facilities, and their CEOs cheered their soaring revenue from ICE in August earnings calls. Each contractor bestowed $500,000 to the Trump–Vance inaugural in December 2024 (the former via its PAC), with their executives giving millions of dollars more last cycle to Trump campaign groups.

The Richmond, Virginia-based company Acquisition Logistics has seen a staggering rise in obligated ICE revenue under Trump: nearly $600 million so far. Last year, the small company, which had little record of operating immigration detention centers, won a $1.2 billion Army contract to build what it touted as the largest immigration detention complex in the nation near El Paso, Texas. Owned by a retired Navy flight officer, the company had previously never received a contract award above $16 million.

Three more companies have been awarded nine-figure amounts in ICE contract obligations since the start of last year: Bethesda-based telecommunications company Tribalco ($206 million); Virginia-headquartered conglomerate Akima ($181.7 million), which runs the Guantánamo Bay detention center; and Virginia-based defense contractor MVM, Inc. ($135 million).

Palantir, the MAGA-aligned software and analytics contractor, has received payments from ICE toward $81 million in contract obligations since Trump’s inauguration. Internal ICE materials seen by 404 Media reveal that Palantir is building an app being used by ICE agents, named ELITE, that locates targets on a map-like interface, drawing in data from sources like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Palantir’s overall government contract obligations, including from the Army, Air Force, and other federal departments, jumped to $1 billion last year. Palantir CEO Alex Karp gave $1 million to both the pro-Trump MAGA Inc. super PAC and the inauguration, and the company reportedly donated to the president’s White House ballroom project. One of the company’s projects with the Army, the Project Maven AI tool, was expanded last year to a ceiling of $1.3 billion through 2029.

Some brand-name companies are keeping up contracts with ICE as the agency has tackled, tased, and shot American citizens and immigrants in what civil rights groups including the ACLU argue is a violation of due process. The New York City-based consulting firm Deloitte & Touche LLP has been given more than $48.8 million in obligated payments from ICE under Trump for services including logistical and administrative support. Dell’s government contracting arm has raked in ICE payments toward more than $25.2 million in contracts for licensing of Microsoft’s “business intelligence” platform Power BI. Media company Thomson Reuters has been awarded $7.5 million for subscription services to law enforcement databases. Xerox has been awarded more than $153,000 by ICE for equipment and on-site support.",https://readsludge.com/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-at-2.52.34---PM-1.png,N,,2026-01-16 19:58:31.389675

He said one possible answer would be to let Democrats have a separate vote on the Homeland Security bill.

The options for Democrats on Homeland Security are all rather bleak.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress is halfway home in approving government funding for the current budget year that began Oct. 1 after the Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly passed a three-bill package.

Now comes the hard part. Lawmakers still must negotiate a spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security amid soaring tensions on Capitol Hill after the shooting of a Minnesota woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.

Lawmakers are working to complete passage of all 12 annual spending bills before Jan. 30, the deadline set in a funding patch that ended a 43-day government shutdown in November. With the Senate’s action on Thursday, six of those bills have now passed through both chambers of Congress. The measure before the Senate passed by a broadly bipartisan vote of 82-15. It now goes to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.

That recent success would greatly reduce the impact of a shutdown, in the unlikely event that there is one at the end of January, since lawmakers have now provided full-year funding for such agencies as the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Interior and Justice.

Lawmakers from both parties are determined to prevent another lapse in funding for the remaining agencies. The House’s approval of a separate two-bill package this week nudges them closer to getting all 12 done in the next two weeks.

“Our goal, Mr. President is to get all of these bills signed into law. No continuing resolutions that lock in previous priorities and don’t reflect today’s realities,” said Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “No more disastrous government shutdowns that are totally unnecessary and so harmful.”

ICE shooting inflames debate on funding

The biggest hurdle ahead is the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The plan was to bring that bill before the House this week, but Rep. Tom Cole, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the decision was made to pull the bill and “buy some time” as lawmakers respond to the Minneapolis shooting.

Democrats are seeking what Rep. Rosa DeLauro called “guardrails” that would come with funding for ICE.

“We can’t deal with the lawlessness and terrorizing of communities,” said DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re going back and forth with offers, and that’s where we are.”

Trump’s deportation crackdown, focused on cities in Democratic-leaning states, has incensed many House Democrats who demand a strong legislative response. Last week, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in a shooting that federal officials said was an act of self-defense but that the mayor described as reckless and unnecessary.

Some 70 Democrats have signed onto an effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Others are seeking specific changes to how the agency operates, such as requiring ICE agents to wear body cameras.

“There are a variety of different things that can be done that we have put on the table and will continue to put on the table to get ICE under control so that they are actually conducting themselves like every other law enforcement agency in the country, as opposed to operating as if they’re above the law, somehow thinking they’ve got absolute immunity,” said Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, which includes nearly 100 Democratic members, formally announced opposition to any funding to immigration enforcement agencies within the Department of Homeland Security “unless there are meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices.”

Looking for a solution

Cole said any changes to the Homeland Security funding bill would need sign-on from the White House. He said one possible answer would be to let Democrats have a separate vote on the Homeland Security bill. If passed, it would then be combined with some other spending bills for transmittal to the Senate. Republicans used a similar procedural tactic to get a previous spending package over the finish line in the House.

The options for Democrats on Homeland Security are all rather bleak. If Congress passes a continuing resolution to fund the agency at current levels, that gives the Trump administration more discretion to spend the money as it wants.

Meanwhile, any vote to eliminate funding for ICE won’t stop massive sums from flowing to the agency because Trump’s tax cut and border security bill, passed last summer, injects roughly $170 billion into immigration enforcement over the next four years.

Also, any vote to eliminate funding could put some Democrats in tough reelection battles in a difficult position this fall as Republicans accuse them of insufficiently supporting law enforcement.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education.","One year after Donald Trump’s second inauguration, a pattern emerges. Across dozens of executive orders, agency memos, funding decisions and enforcement changes, the administration has weakened federal civil rights law and the foundations of the country’s racially inclusive democracy.

From the start, the U.S. was not built to include everyone equally. The Constitution protected and promoted slavery. Most states limited voting to white men. Congress restricted naturalized citizenship to “free white persons.” These choices were not accidents. They shaped who could belong and who could exercise political power, and they entrenched a racial political majority that lasted for generations.

That began to change in the 1960s. After decades of protest and pressure, Congress enacted laws that prohibited discrimination in employment, education, voting, immigration and housing.

Federal agencies were charged with enforcing those laws, collecting data to identify discrimination and conditioning public funds on compliance. These choices reshaped U.S. demographics and institutions, with the current Congress “the most racially and ethnically diverse in history,” according to the Pew Research Center. The laws did not eliminate racial inequality, but they made exclusion easier to see and harder to defend.

The first year of the second Trump administration marks a sharp reversal.

Cumulative retreat

Rather than repealing civil rights statutes outright, the administration has focused on disabling the mechanisms that make those laws work.

Drawing on over two decades of teaching and writing about civil rights and my experience directing a GW Law project on inclusive democracy, I believe this pattern reflects not isolated administrative actions but a cumulative retreat from the federal government’s role as an enforcer of civil rights law.

Over the past year, the president and his administration have taken a series of connected actions:

• On its first day in office, announced the end of all federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, including diversity officers, equity plans and related grants and contracts.

• Shut down or sharply cut funding for federal programs aimed at reducing inequality, including offices focused on minority health, minority-owned businesses, fair federal contracting, environmental justice and closing the digital divide in broadband.

• Warned schools that diversity programs could jeopardize their federal funding, opened investigations into colleges offering scholarships to students protected under DACA – the Obama-era policy providing deportation protection for undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – and signaled that colleges risk losing federal student aid if their accrediting agencies consider diversity.

• Revoked security clearances and access to federal buildings for employees at law firms with diversity policies. The FCC investigated media companies for promoting diversity and threatened to block mergers by companies with similar programs, leading several companies to drop their initiatives.

• Issued a government-wide memo labeling common best practices in hiring, admissions and other selection and evaluation processes – such as compiling diverse applicant pools, valuing cultural competence, considering first-generation or low-income status and seeking geographic and demographic representation – as potentially legally suspect. The memo warned that federal funding could be cut to schools, employers and state and local governments using such practices. Federal prosecutors reportedly investigated federal contractors that consider diversity, characterizing such initiatives as fraud.

• Weakened enforcement against discrimination by ordering agencies to stop using disparate impact analysis. That kind of analysis identifies disparities in outcomes, assesses whether they are justified by legitimate objectives, and intervenes when they are not. The Department of Justice, the EEOC, the National Credit Union Administration and other agencies complied and dropped disparate impact analysis. Because algorithmic systems typically operate without explicit intent, eliminating disparate impact analysis reduces federal agencies’ ability to detect and address discriminatory outcomes produced by increasingly automated government and private-sector decision-making.

• Rescinded an executive order that barred discrimination by federal contractors, required steps to ensure nondiscriminatory hiring and employment, and subjected contractors to federal compliance reviews and record-keeping. This weakened a key mechanism used since 1965 to detect and remedy workplace discrimination.

• Eliminated data used to track inequality, including rolling back guidance encouraging schools to collect data on racial disparities in discipline and special education. The administration also removed data used to identify racial disparities in environmental harms.

• Dismantled or sharply reduced civil rights offices across federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Department of Education. About three-quarters of lawyers in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division left.

• Pressured the Smithsonian to remove exhibits about racial injustice, restored Confederate monuments and military base names, and barred schools and teacher training programs from including material the administration labeled divisive, such as unconscious bias.

• Declared English the nation’s only official language, repealed a requirement that federal agencies provide meaningful access to government programs and services for people with limited English proficiency, and prompted the General Services Admininistration and the departments of Justice, Education and other agencies to scale back language-assistance requirements and services.

• Attempted to limit birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and adopted practices that treat ethnicity and non-English accents as legitimate reasons for immigration stops.

The pattern is hard to miss

Taken together, these shifts have practical consequences.

When agencies stop collecting data on racial disparities, discrimination becomes harder to detect. When disparate impact analysis is abandoned, unfair practices with no legitimate purpose go unchallenged. When diversity programs are chilled through investigations and funding threats, institutions respond by narrowing opportunity. When history and language are recast as threats to unity, truth and freedom of speech and thought are suppressed and undermined.

Administration officials argue that these steps are needed to prevent discrimination against white people, promote unity, ensure “colorblind equality” and comply with a Supreme Court decision that struck down affirmative action in college admissions. But that ruling did not ban awareness of racial inequality, or neutral policies aimed at reducing it. Many of the administration’s actions rely on broad claims of illegality without providing specific violations.

The selective nature of enforcement is also telling.

Books about racism and civil rights were removed from military libraries, while books praising Nazi ideas or claiming racial intelligence differences were left untouched. The administration suspended admissions of refugees – over 90% of whom have been from Africa, Asia and Latin America in recent years – but then reopened the refugee program for white South Africans.

One year in, the pattern is hard to miss.

The administration is not simply applying neutral rules. It is dismantling the systems that once helped the U.S. move toward a more open and equal democracy. It is replacing them with policies that selectively narrow access to economic, cultural and educational participation.

The result is not simply a change in policy, but a fundamental shift in the trajectory of American democracy.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/712890/original/file-20260116-56-n2sjl5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C55%2C2239%2C1119&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:33.394058

Dozens of members of Congress gathered in Minnesota to hear on-the-ground testimony and bear witness to how federal agents have menaced Minnesotans in recent weeks, especially Somalis and Latinos. But they also learned of how immigration agents’ actions have hardened Minnesotans’ resolve to fight for their constitutional rights.

Immigration raids are resulting in injuries, idling vehicles left in the streets, abandoned dogs wandering through neighborhoods and destruction of property, testifiers said. Agents are also scanning the streets for Minnesotans of color and asking for their papers.

“People are walking around on the street with their passports. That’s not American. That’s the furthest thing from it,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told the federal lawmakers. “Please take back to your respective constituencies and your colleagues the message of, if you love your own community, do not let this happen in ours.”

Friday’s hearing was not a formal hearing, but the sixth in a series conducted by U.S. House Democrats to highlight the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts. The committee also invited both Minnesota Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. No Republicans attended.

Newly elected St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Laos, told the committee that advisors recommended she carry her passport in case she gets stopped by federal agents. Her’s parents, who are U.S. citizens, are afraid to leave their homes for fear that their “neighbors would tell (federal agents) that that house was an Asian house.”

Trump has used fraud in Minnesota’s public programs to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community and justify sending 3,000 immigration agents to the state.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations of Minnesota, said many Somali Minnesotans are afraid to send their children to school, and elders are carrying immigration documents to their mosque.

“Do your job. Stand up for the Constitution of the American people. Our lives depend on it,” Hussein said.

Emilia Gonzalez Avalos, executive director of Unidos Minnesota, said the immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have caused many to distrust the federal government.

“People should not have to worry that an encounter with a masked, armed federal agent could cost them their lives. This is not about whether immigration law exists. This is about how power is exercised,” Gonzalez Avalos said.

A lawsuit filed Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union alleges immigration authorities are racially profiling Minnesota residents and detaining people with legal status, including citizens. Minnesota and the Twin Cities are also suing the Trump administration to stop the immigration surge.

U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu of California encouraged Minnesotans to keep documenting the unlawful actions of federal agents and noted that the statute of limitations for violations of federal law is five years.

“While this administration may not hold anyone accountable, I guarantee you a future administration will,” Lieu said. “All of us are here today to let the people in Minnesota know that you are not alone, that the Constitution protects you and you are on the right side of history.”

In D.C., Congress is rushing to pass annual appropriations by the end of January to avoid another government shutdown.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan hinted that House Democrats may use the actions of federal agents in Minnesota, including the killing of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, as leverage in the upcoming budget battle.

“We have passed policies to tell them not to do ICE actions in front of schools, health centers, funerals … but we still have violations,” Tlaib said. “When Speaker (Mike) Johnson says ICE is doing what it was created to do, remember this when the funding comes up next week.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan--scaled-e1768590794467-2048x1331.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:42.340471

It also saw the birth of the modern national security state.
Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly.
For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency.
Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them.","The Trump administration frequently uses fear as a weapon, whether stoking it, pledging to shield some populations from it, or endeavoring to inflict it on others. For example, the administration has engaged in what “border czar” Tom Homan describes as a “shock and awe” campaign that has included aggressively raiding communities around the country, shipping some migrants to dangerous prisons, and publicizing these actions through highly stylized videos and memes. The administration portrays its targets as “the worst of the worst,” as “pedophiles, armed robbers, and drug traffickers” whom law-abiding citizens should fear. The government’s own data, however, suggests otherwise. According to Reuters, “some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation.” Citizens, too, have been swept up in raids. Entire communities thus have been placed in terror by an administration that claims to be protecting them.

The administration also has employed fear-based governing outside of the immigration context, including against the federal workforce. Trump’s director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, famously said before the 2024 election that a second Trump administration should inflict “trauma” on federal career employees. He explained that when “‘bureaucrats … wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work, because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down …. We want to put them in trauma.’” Vought’s wish has come true, with thousands of federal employees chased out of their jobs through a combination of ideological targeting and large-scale gutting of agencies.

Although Donald Trump, Russell Vought, and their colleagues excel at wielding fear as a tool of governance, they did not invent the practice. In his important new book, “The Triumph of Fear: Domestic Surveillance and Political Repression from McKinley to Eisenhower,” Patrick G. Eddington explores several earlier periods in American history during which federal officials and politicians regularly stoked fear against, and instilled fear in, disfavored targets. Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute who has worked as a CIA analyst, focuses his book on the late 19th century to the 1950s. This era encompassed two world wars, the height of the Cold War, and domestic social and cultural upheaval. It also saw the birth of the modern national security state. Eddington draws on extensive archival research to describe and explain the many ways in which fear pervaded the government and politics of the time and was built into the national security state’s DNA.

Although Eddington navigates the era in a mostly straightforward, chronological manner, several themes and subthemes recur throughout the book. As its title suggests, the book’s overarching theme is fear. Eddington underscores this point from the outset, observing in the introduction that “the driving force” behind the developments he studies—principally the government’s “surveilling, penetrating, and actively subverting domestic political activities”—was “fear.” One aspect of that fear is that felt by “executive branch officials, members of Congress, and those on the federal bench—fear that challenges to existing political, economic, or social paradigms would alter the country in ways that would disempower those who benefitted from the status quo.” As Eddington’s subsequent chapters make clear, fear played a still more ubiquitous role in the events of the time. Politicians and officials not only felt fear themselves; they sought to make others afraid—afraid of their own government and of one another.

Beneath this overarching theme lie the details, spanning decades, of the means that powerful actors in the executive branch, in Congress, and in compliant parts of the private sector used to instill and to respond to fear. Because Eddington covers so much ground, I highlight just three such means here, by way of illustration: the growth of the federal government’s surveillance and secrecy capacities; the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ethnicity and nationality; and the surveilling and punishing of groups based on ideology.

The six decades Eddington explores were pivotal for the growth of the U.S. national security state, including the government’s capacities for surveillance and secrecy. With respect to the federal government’s surveillance activities, Eddington illuminates, among other things, the way that its growth was a product of executive initiative as well as congressional, judicial, and corporate enabling. He explains, for example, that the Treasury Department’s Secret Service Division was the dominant agent of domestic surveillance by the early 20th century, and that it went largely unchecked by Congress for years, even after the press revealed that the division had spied on members of Congress at President Theodore Roosevelt’s direction. Roosevelt had ordered the surveillance in an effort to uncover the source of an earlier media story. A subsequent spying scandal did lead Congress to adopt legislation in 1908, restricting the Secret Service Division’s activities to “defeating counterfeiting and presidential protection.” The scandal was a sensational one: The Navy had directed the division to spy on a naval officer at the urging of the mother of a woman with whom the officer allegedly had had an affair. Even after this scandal and subsequent legislation, however, the Theodore Roosevelt administration remained undeterred. It found a way around the legislative bar by creating a new organization: the Bureau of Investigation within the Department of Justice. It did so by using the Justice Department’s general revenue fund to employ 30 part-time agents, including many veterans of the Secret Service Division. As employees of the new bureau, these agents conducted domestic surveillance that the Secret Service Division was now barred from conducting.

Eddington traces iterations of this pattern—a mixture of executive initiative, occasional congressional pushback, and more frequent congressional cooperation or willful ignorance—throughout the decades that he chronicles. Take, for example, his coverage of the period from the outbreak of World War I in Europe through the aftermath of both the war and the Russian Revolution. In the months following the sinking of the Lusitania, the Wilson administration grew desperate to surveil suspected German agents and their sympathizers in the United States, leading Wilson to authorize a renewed domestic surveillance role for the Secret Service Division. This action “effectively violate[d] the 1908 law” limiting the division’s activity, and Eddington “found no evidence that Congress was informed” of it. Shortly after the United States entered the war, however, Congress authorized some forms of surveillance by the division—for example, to conduct investigations under the Trading with the Enemy Act and the Food and Fuel Control Act. By the end of World War I, “the [division] and [the bureau had] full-fledged domestic spying counterparts in the [Army and Navy].”

These capacities were augmented through cooperation by corporate and civil society actors. For example, the Bureau of Investigation arranged for the major telecommunications providers to transmit copies, without warrants, of “incoming and outgoing telegrams of individuals or organizations of interest to investigators.” The bureau also partnered with a private organization comprised of volunteer investigators, “the American Protective League,” whose members were known to go rogue, “masquerading as [Secret Service] agents” and “in one case ordering a Des Moines, Iowa, resident to raise the American flag over his home.” Eddington also describes how these surveillance precedents and capabilities continued to be utilized after the war’s end. In the postwar years, “the Bolshevik threat [became] the prime, but not exclusive, focus.” As I elaborate below, other targets would include Japanese Americans and critics of their internment.

Secrecy was also an essential tool for the growing national security state, and for the executive branch more broadly. Although secrecy is frequently used to bypass congressional and judicial oversight, Congress and the judiciary enabled executive secrecy in significant ways. For example, the National Security Act of 1959 permitted the National Security Agency’s director “to bar ‘the disclosure of the organization or any function of’” the agency. The Espionage Act of 1917 bars a much wider range of speech, including information disclosures. Eddington stresses the Espionage Act’s importance in this regard, focusing especially on its use to punish anti-war speech and other forms of dissent throughout World War I and the Cold War. The Supreme Court also enabled broad prosecutorial discretion to punish anti-establishment but not imminently dangerous speech in a well-known line of cases beginning in 1919. The Supreme Court’s decisions in those cases, including Schenck v. United States, Debs v. United States, and Abrams v. United States, endorsed a narrow view of speakers’ First Amendment protections, particularly during wartime.

Eddington also emphasizes the significance of the state secrets privilege and the Supreme Court’s 1953 decision recognizing it in United States v. Reynolds. The privilege may be invoked by the federal government in litigation where “‘there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’” A significant problem with the ruling, as Eddington points out, is its suggestion that in some cases judges should not require disclosure even to themselves, for in camera inspection. The danger of abuse that this creates is evidenced in the aftermath of Reynolds itself. The case originated as a tort suit brought by a group of widows whose husbands, all civilian engineers, had perished in a crash of an Air Force B-29 bomber. The Air Force successfully resisted disclosing the accident report on the basis that it contained state secrets, and the Supreme Court refused to order even in camera disclosure. Decades later, the accident report, which by then had been declassified, was obtained by the grown child of one of the passengers. She learned that the Air Force had lied so many years ago. The report contained no state secrets but instead revealed negligence on the part of the Air Force.

The scope of the surveillance and secrecy capacities that Eddington explores is breathtaking, but their greatest significance lies in their wielding by government actors as tools to target disfavored groups and ideas. Among the most notorious instances of ethnic or nationality-based targeting was that perpetrated against Japanese Americans during World War II. Eddington’s research sheds new light on the extent of the government’s surveillance of Japanese Americans before and during World War II, and on the gulf between the information it gathered and the lies it told to stoke fear against, and justify the mass internment of, this group. For example, John Franklin Carter, whom President Franklin Roosevelt had secretly commissioned to perform intelligence work for FDR directly, concluded that “98 percent of the Japanese in Hawaii were ‘loyal to the U.S., and that those who are not’” had already been identified by the Navy and the FBI. In a cover letter forwarding one of his reports to FDR, Carter wrote, chillingly and prophetically, that his investigator “‘feels that the Japanese are more in danger from the whites than the other way around.’”

Eddington also highlights the political considerations that led FDR not only to support mass internment for Japanese Americans, but to prolong it. For example, he cites a memo that FDR wrote to two officials, explaining his view that “it would be a mistake to do anything drastic or sudden” in ending internment. FDR “wanted to determine ‘how many Japanese families would be acceptable to public opinion’ for relocation back to the West Coast” and suggested distributing Japanese Americans around the United States to “avoid[] public outcry” on the West coast. As an intelligence report that Eddington quotes acknowledged, the violent public backlash that did follow Japanese Americans’ return home stemmed both from “racial hatred” and “from whites who [did] not want to resume business competition with returning Japanese.”

Surveillance was also used to target ideological dissenters, including those who criticized the federal government’s actions against Japanese Americans. As Eddington recounts, “Such was the fate of a young Army private and aspiring singer-songwriter named Pete Seeger.” Seeger, who had a Japanese American fiancée (who eventually became his wife of nearly 70 years), wrote to the California American Legion to protest its passage of a resolution calling to deport all Japanese and Japanese Americans from the United States and to bar citizenship for all Japanese descendants. The Legion forwarded Seeger’s letter to the FBI, which eventually built an intelligence file on Seeger that ran more than 1,700 pages.

Seeger’s case is just the tip of the iceberg of ideological surveillance and punishment in American history. Eddington chronicles much of this history, ranging from the Secret Service Division’s targeting of anarchists and the nascent Bureau of Investigation’s surveillance of socialists, through the Palmer Raids, Espionage Act prosecutions of socialist and other speakers, “anti-red” scares stoked by members of Congress and the executive branch, and the efforts across many presidential administrations to surveil and target participants in the civil rights movement.

Among the many striking elements in Eddington’s account of ideological targeting is the way that politicians stoked and wielded fears of socialism and communism to aggrandize themselves and to intimidate and control rival politicians. Eddington recounts, for example, that the House Select Committee on Un-American Activities had lost public and institutional support by 1944 but was revived and turned into a permanent committee after Rep. John Rankin, partnering with the American Legion, launched a public campaign to support it. The resuscitated committee went on to “do massive professional, personal, and political damage to thousands of individual Americans and domestic civil society organizations.” The prospect of committee “witch hunt[s]” also led some congressional Democrats, including Rep. Jennings Randolph, successfully to pressure President Truman to employ harsh internal loyalty measures throughout the executive branch. Eddington also gives their due to those administration members, representatives, and other high-profile figures who resisted the “anti-red” race to the bottom. Eleanor Roosevelt, for one, was a voice of conscience, writing to Truman: “I feel we have capitulated to our fear of Communism, and instead of fighting to improve Democracy, we are doing what the Soviets would do in trying to repress anything which we are afraid might not command public support.”

Eddington’s book is a rich, important contribution to our understanding of a pivotal time in American history, and of the growth of America’s national security state in particular. Of course, there are other significant works on the national security state and its abuses, and Eddington draws on many of them. As he notes in his introduction, however, “The Triumph of Fear” is extraordinary in its scale and in its use of primary as well as secondary literature to illuminate its subject. And Eddington is particularly effective in his choice of stories to highlight and to connect to the book’s larger theme of fear-based governing and politics.

My one criticism of the book is that Eddington occasionally adds a conclusory statement about legality to an otherwise compelling, evidence-based description of government activity. For example, in discussing proposed legislation to criminalize certain disclosures about cryptology, Eddington states: “This was not an encroachment on the First Amendment—it was a proposal to destroy it in the name of national security.” Having written a great deal myself on the law of national security disclosures and the First Amendment, I am extremely sympathetic to Eddington’s point. It is, however, a complicated legal topic to which justice cannot be done in a single sentence. That said, my quibble is a small one because statements like the quoted one make up a tiny part of an otherwise excellent book. I mention this quibble only because the book on the whole is so strong and because its strength stems largely from its intensely research-driven approach.

Because Eddington does, admirably, let his exhaustive research do most of the talking, he does not step outside of the studied time period to explicitly draw comparisons to the current administration. But readers will do as they please, and I suspect I will not be alone in seeing parallels between some of the terrible developments that Eddington chronicles and events now taking place on a regular basis in the United States. Readers likely will see not only parallels but roots, as today’s abuses are enabled in part by the growth in the national security state that Eddington recounts. Eddington’s book would still be an important contribution even if it were not so lamentably relevant to current events. But in this moment, especially, I am grateful for Eddington’s work. The historical context that it provides enables us better to understand what it is that we are living through.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/surveillance-camera-(1).png?sfvrsn=1f2a75b9_5,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:45.944466

The “ICE Out of Virginia” protest, organized by Party for Socialism and Liberation-Virginia, Indivisible RVA and 50501 Virginia, lasted over an hour and halted traffic on Broad Street.

“We are here today to make a loud stand against ICE and this regime that has not represented us, has used our tax dollars to rip our neighbors away from us, has murdered our neighbors in front of us,” said Reed Baldwin of the PSLVA as he addressed the crowd gathered in the pouring rain at Walker Plaza.

The local protest was one of roughly 500 organized nationwide as part of the “ICE Out for Good” weekend, with demonstrations in nearly 1,200 cities and towns after the shooting, according to national organizers.

Trump administration officials have said the shooting was an act of self-defense after Good allegedly tried to hit the agent with her vehicle. Multiple videos contradict that account.

Residents, organizers and speakers from several Richmond groups joined national criticism of the fatal shooting and the Trump administration’s explanation of the incident. They also raised concerns about ICE’s treatment of immigrants.

“They tell us that the immigrants are the problem, that they’re criminals, that Black and brown people are the problem, that trans people, that transkids are the problem,” said Richmond Defensa organizer Violeta Vega. “They tell those lies to our face every day to justify this violence, to justify this terror.”

Demonstrators also criticized decades of increased federal spending on immigration enforcement and border patrol, saying needs such as housing, health care and education have been overlooked.

Speakers encouraged protesters to prepare for a general strike and to organize in defense of themselves and their communities. They also urged people to call on local and state officials to end operations connected to ICE and to reconsider Richmond’s use of Flock Safety cameras, which some activists criticized as surveillance tools.

“The majority of the progress that has been made, it’s been made by, every single day, ordinary working-class citizens,” Te’Shaun Cleckley said. “So, honest to god, I think it’s up to us.”

In a statement, Mayor Danny Avula reiterated that the city and Richmond Police Department do not coordinate with ICE on deportations. He did not say whether the city’s contract with Flock Safety cameras would be ended, instead stressing that the department uses the technology with transparency and for public safety.

Organizers said they plan a peace vigil outside the Virginia War Memorial on Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday and a walkout on Tuesday in response to Good’s fatal shooting and federal immigration policies they oppose.",https://epmgaa.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/15/No_ICE_march_1.2026_JTH_RFP-16.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:58:35.310371

It feels like a military occupation.” Kaohly Her, the mayor of St Paul, was pointed.","A large group of Democratic Congress members, senators and state politicians on Friday condemned the “intense trauma and terror” caused by Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota.

One lawmaker warned the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to preserve records for an investigation into the administration’s deadly use of force.

The dozens of leaders staged an “accountability” hearing at the state capitol in St Paul into Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) actions as demonstrations continued to spread in the city and elsewhere, along with sporadic clashes with federal officers nine days after Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

The US president has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to justify sending in troops to quell the protests, which have remained largely peaceful despite the occasional skirmishes and continued arrests.

The gathered lawmakers and officials on Friday labeled their special panel hearing “Kidnapped and Disappeared: Trump’s deadly assault on Minnesota”.

Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who has been singled out for vitriolic and racist public attacks by Trump, decried aggressive treatment of residents, including US citizens, and their vehicles by federal agents and officers.

“Dozens of US citizens have been taken into custody and released hours later. We have yet to see charges materialize, because in nearly all instances, no federal charges are possible,” Omar said, adding that others were taken from their own vehicles.

“Abandoned cars with broken windows have become a normal sight of daily life in the Twin Cities,” she said, referring to the adjacent cities of Minneapolis and St Paul.

As ICE raids and traffic stops have increased, families are being torn apart.

Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, was present and has spoken out against the FBI shutting state and local investigators out of the examination of Good’s killing. And Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, attended, having told ICE to leave and citing the federal government’s aggressive approach as making the city less safe.

From further afield, the Washington state congresswoman Pramila Jayapal attended and chaired Friday’s panel. Jayapal sits on several House committees dealing with immigration and the constitution and she is the senior whip of the Democratic caucus and chair emerita of the progressive caucus.

“The Trump administration has targeted and terrorized people of all immigration statuses, including US citizens, violating constitutional rights and court orders, destroying our existing immigration system and eroding all of our rights,” she said.

Quoting a Minnesota Star Tribune editorial suggesting that the state was “under siege”, she added: “Battalions of armed federal agents are moving through neighborhoods, transit hubs, malls and parking lots and staging near churches, mosques and schools. Strangers with guns have metastasized in spaces where daily life should be routine and safe. It feels like a military occupation.”

Kaohly Her, the mayor of St Paul, was pointed. “We are ground zero for Trump’s war on America, a war on our democracy, on our freedoms, on our rights as Americans,” she said.

Scrutiny of ICE operations has increased in the wake of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Good as she attempted to drive away from ICE agents last Wednesday while they ordered her out of the car and tried to open the door. She was not armed and addressed officers calmly, but the White House quickly called her a domestic terrorist.

Protests have escalated over her killing, and the exclusion of state investigators from an FBI inquiry. Polling released by the American Civil Liberties Union on Friday showed that 71% of voters supported an independent investigation into the shooting, and 84% said people had the constitutional right to observe and document ICE activity in public.

ICE agents, meanwhile, have continued to engage in violent confrontations with residents, protesters and those being sought as allegedly undocumented or otherwise in violation of immigration law. Many of the more violent encounters have been caught on video and posted to social media.

The Minnesota congresswoman Betty McCollum condemned “Trump’s abuse of power”.

“High school students have been thrown to the ground and pepper-sprayed on their own school grounds, and it’s happening right here, right now,” she said.

“The actions of these agents, which are totally unprofessional and illegal, create great harm and fear. Secretary Noem, you better be preserving your documents unaltered, because you are going to be held to testify and you will be subpoenaed.”

Jayapal called for ICE to cease its surges.

She said: “This pattern of reckless, even lethal use of force cannot continue, and we will do everything in our power to hold the administration accountable and stop this lawlessness.

“What is happening in Minnesota is a pattern that is dangerous to every single person in America, because if they can erode the rights of some, they can do it to you. No one is safe.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7037090a3b78f8d083558f5614c9731c65f6676/471_0_4713_3771/master/4713.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6c8f3ba3b001cb08e89b7ea92b5e8d8f",N,,2026-01-16 13:58:27.586390

According to KPD, the Hays County Sheriff’s Office (HSCO) got a call from ICE requesting “ambulance assistance for an individual being detained by federal authorities” at about 7:45 a.m. KXAN reached out to HSCO, and it said it did not assist with this incident.

KXAN has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for more clarity on the detainee’s condition and will update this story if a response is given.

KPD said it was notified of the request and responded to the 19000 block of I-35 Frontage Road in Kyle to support emergency medical services (EMS).

The department said EMS took the detainee and ICE personnel.

Hays County Judge Ruben Becerra said the county wasn’t notified of ICE operations prior to this incident.

“Historically, when federal agents come into our jurisdiction, we have a courtesy call communication with local officials so that we understand what’s going on in our communities,” Becerra said. “When we reach out consistently for information [Homeland Security] do not give us anything back except for a generic response.”

Myles Martin, an organizer with Mano Amiga Action, an advocacy group that supports immigrants and marginalized families in Hays and Caldwell counties, said recent events are heightening fears.

Martin pointed to cases like the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of 37-year-old Minnesota woman Renee Nicole Macklin Good by an ICE deportation officer in Minneapolis as examples fueling those safety concerns.

Amid a massive expansion in immigration detention in 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) dramatically reduced the number of facility inspection reports by the agency’s Office of Detention Oversight (ODO), one of its key tools for tracking detention conditions. There was a 36.25% decline in ICE detention facility inspection reports published in 2025 compared to the previous year, according to an analysis of data pulled from the agency’s facility inspections website. These inspections assess whether facilities meet a range of detention standards, including those that shape fundamental health and safety conditions for the people being imprisoned there, including whether detention facilities are providing adequate health care, monitoring and effectively preventing suicide, providing quality food, and maintaining habitable shelter.

A Father’s Quest for Justice Finds Resolution After 13 Years

Craig Stingley had no legal training, no big-name lawyer or civil rights advocate by his side. Yet for 13 years, he refused to accept that the judicial system would hold no one responsible for the killing of his 16-year-old son, Corey. The quest for justice dominated his life. He gathered police reports, witness statements and other evidence in the Dec. 14, 2012, fatal incident inside a Milwaukee-area convenience store. The youth had tried to shoplift $12 worth of flavored malt beverages at the shop before abandoning the items and turning to leave. That’s when three men wrestled him to the ground to hold him for the police. The medical examiner determined that he died of a brain injury from asphyxiation after a “violent struggle with multiple individuals.” The manner of death: homicide.

“It is not about esoteric issues of international law. It is about real people, real stories and a real group of human beings. The Rohingya of Myanmar. They have been targeted for destruction,” Dawda Jallow told ICJ judges. The Gambia brought the case accusing Myanmar of breaching the 1948 Genocide Convention during a crackdown in 2017. Legal experts are watching closely as it could give clues for how the court will handle similar accusations against Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, in a case brought to the ICJ by South Africa.

First responders removed Good from the scene on the suburban street in Minneapolis.
ICE officers left the scene at 11:20 a.m., and the FBI arrived at 11:31 a.m.","Official reports have shed light on the moments immediately after Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis last week, and how first responders and bystanders reacted to the shooting, which has led to nationwide protests.

According to police files, fire response reports and transcripts of 911 calls released to NBC News in response to a public records request, Good was still alive when a Minneapolis Fire Emergency Medical Services team reached her.

The reports paint a vivid picture of the chaotic moments following the Jan. 7 shooting, which has become a definitive moment in President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“Every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm must be properly reported and reviewed by the agency in accordance with agency policy, procedure, and guidelines,” Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to NBC News. “All shootings are initially reviewed by the appropriate federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency principally charged with first response to the incident.”

McLaughlin added that “following a review of the incident by the appropriate investigative agency, ICE will conduct an independent review of the critical incident.”

The fire response report states that during the incident, Good had “apparent gunshots” to her chest, forearm and face, and was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity.”

Footage from the incident, including cellphone video taken by Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot Good, shows her at the wheel of her Honda SUV interacting with ICE officers before the shooting.

In the footage, cars can be heard honking, sirens wail and protesters are blowing whistles. Ross is seen walking around the front of the car to face Good. “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you,” Good is heard telling Ross. Another officer near the SUV tells Good to get out of the car.

In the footage, Ross turns to face the front of the SUV as Good’s wife, Becca Good, appears to say, “Drive.” Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive.

In Ross’ cellphone footage, he can then be heard shouting what sounds like “whoa” and firing. Multiple shots can be heard in the video. The view of his phone camera jerks around, points up to the sky and captures a glimpse of his masked face before it levels out and shows the SUV accelerating down the street.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said the officer was acting in self-defense and accused Good of being a “domestic terrorist,” without citing evidence. The FBI is investigating the shooting.

Good, 37, was an American citizen and a mother of three.

Noem said that Ross was treated in a hospital for injuries he sustained in the incident and was released soon after. The emergency services logs say he was first taken to a federal building. A DHS official told NBC News earlier this week said that Ross suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the fatal shooting incident.

The officer walked away from the scene unassisted.

First responders removed Good from the scene on the suburban street in Minneapolis. More than 3,000 federal agents are carrying out ongoing operations in the city, federal government figures say, to root out local corruption and arrest people suspected of serious crimes or immigration breaches.

Eyewitness video shows paramedics treating Good on the sidewalk and carrying her away on a stretcher as people on both sides of the road look on.

Medics applied a tourniquet and gave her CPR before she was taken to a local hospital by ambulance, the fire report said. Hospital staff stopped resuscitation efforts at 10:30 a.m, just under an hour after the shooting.

The first 911 calls were received at 9:38 a.m. CT and the agent who fired the fatal shots left the scene at 10:04 a.m., the police report shows.

The 911 call logs include one caller who told dispatchers: “They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car…. She’s f------ dead.”

Another caller said, “I had to walk away because I have young kids, and ICE is everywhere over there.”

An unidentified 911 caller said, “ICE fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked.”

In one 911 call, which apparently came from a Homeland Security officer who identified himself only as “Philip” and said, “Requesting EMS assistance and local law enforcement.”

“We had officers stuck in a vehicle, and we had agitators on the scene,” Philip continued. The dispatcher asked him for a description of the shooter, but he said: “No, I don’t have any of that stuff, we’re just trying to get assistance (INAUDIBLE).”

Large parts of the 911 call logs have been redacted and blacked out, with the hidden portions labeled “Law Enforcement.”

The police report also noted that “agitators” were cutting crime tape, slashing tires, throwing snow and ice “at federal agents but not at MPD” officers at various points. Border Patrol deployed pepper spray about 20 minutes after the shooting, the police report said.

Bovino ‘not credible’ during recorded testimony

What we know:

The FOX 9 Investigators reviewed hours of depositions, body camera footage and court filings which involve Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino’s conduct and leadership during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago last fall.

As part of a civil lawsuit filed against DHS, Bovino was questioned under oath during which Judge Sara Ellis described him as ""not credible.""

""Bovino appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing ‘cute’ responses… or outright lying,"" Judge Ellis said in her written ruling in November.

DHS did not respond to requests for an interview or questions about Bovino.

Who is Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bavino?

The backstory:

Bovino gained notoriety last year when the Trump administration launched its immigration enforcement operations in major cities last year, including Los Angeles and Chicago.

He has since been seen on the ground in Minnesota as the federal government deploys thousands of immigration agents in the state.

Last week, Bovino stood alongside Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as she defended the ICE agent who shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Bovino: ‘All uses of force have been more than exemplary’

Videos from Chicago show Bovino deploying tear gas at a crowd of protesters in Chicago despite being told by one of his own agents that it wasn’t necessary.

""If you need to deploy gas, deploy [expletive] gas,"" Bovino said in the video.

During recorded depositions a month later, Bovino admitted that he ""did not give a warning"" prior to deploying tear gas canisters toward the public.

Yet, Bovino insisted during his testimony that ""all uses of force have been more than exemplary.""

Judge Ellis also found Bovino was ""outright lying"" at times during his depositions, including when he was questioned about a video that shows Bovino clearly using physical force against a protester.

Bovino repeatedly denied tackling the man to the ground despite the video showing otherwise.

Why you should care:

On another occasion, the judge found Bovino ""lied multiple times"" about why he deployed tear gas on a crowd in Chicago in October, indicating at first that he was hit in the head by a rock. That claim was echoed by DHS in a social media post.

However, during the three days of testimony, Bovino gave conflicting accounts of why he deployed tear gas.

At one point, Bovino acknowledged that a rock ""did not hit me in the head, but it did almost hit me."" On the final day of testimony, Bovino said he ""was mistaken"" and that he deployed tear gas canisters before a rock was thrown at him.

Yet to be seen: Will an appeals court ruling hold any more sway over the administration than the lower court’s?","In a case affecting hundreds of immigrants held at one of the largest detention centers in the country, a Washington state federal judge expressed frustration with Tacoma Immigration Court’s refusal to abide by a September ruling holding many detained people are entitled to bond hearings and ordered notice be given to them of their rights.

Since the September judgment, more than 100 detained immigrants — “left with no other recourse” — have filed habeas corpus petitions in federal court seeking bond hearings, said U.S. District Court Judge Tiffany Cartwright in her Wednesday ruling. Many more, particularly those without lawyers, may remain detained because they don’t know about the September order and how they can use it to petition U.S. District Court.

A habeas petition alleges someone is being unlawfully imprisoned or, in this case, detained for days, months or years in jail-like conditions at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. Within the 1,575-bed facility (soon to have 1,635 beds) sits an immigration court for those detained there.

This week’s ruling is the latest development in a class-action case that raises separation-of-power questions and tests the ability of courts to limit federal actions under President Donald Trump. In one corner sits a U.S. District Court, which belongs to the independent judicial branch of government. In another, sits an immigration court, part of the executive branch and subject to the authority of the U.S. Department of Justice.

Immigration judges can be fired at will, as demonstrated by dozens of firings last year, including one in Seattle.

The class-action suit involving the Tacoma Immigration Court arose over a practice, beginning in 2022, of denying bond hearings to many immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally, or in legalese “without inspection.” Bonds, like bail in criminal court, allow an individual to remain free while a case is pending.

Espousing a novel legal theory, some of the court’s judges — including now interim U.S. Attorney for Western Washington Neil Floyd — have said such immigrants are subject to mandatory detention under a section of immigration law dealing with “applicants for admission” to the U.S. Immigrants who crossed the border unlawfully at any time in the past still count as applicants for admission, even if they have lived in the U.S. for decades, the Tacoma immigration judges held.

The Trump administration turned that theory into national policy with a Department of Homeland Security memo last July, followed by a September ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals. The board also belongs to the executive branch.

Cartwright in September ruled that the novel legal theory contradicts long-standing practice and common understanding of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Hundreds of other federal courts have ruled similarly, including a California court whose November ruling applies nationally.

Yet, Tacoma’s immigration judges have continued to say they lack jurisdiction to issue bonds in these cases, though sometimes they have stipulated “alternative” bonds they would set if they could.

Floyd, who may not keep his job in the U.S. attorney’s office long due to a seeming move by federal judges to oust him, told The Seattle Times last fall that Cartwright’s September ruling is a nonbinding “advisory opinion.” He pointed out that the so-called “declaratory” ruling does not directly order the government to do something — prohibited in certain class-action immigration cases — but states what the law is as the judge sees it

Cartwright called the notion of her previous ruling as merely advisory flat-out wrong. Quoting case law, she wrote this week: “A declaratory judgment is a real judgment, not just a bit of friendly advice.”

Advertising

And a Congressional law allows a court to take steps to facilitate compliance, according to Matt Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, a nonprofit legal advocacy group representing plaintiffs in the class-action suit. As Tacoma’s immigration judges failed to change their stance, the nonprofit made several requests to Cartwright, most of which she granted this week.

She ordered that, within five days of arriving at the Northwest ICE Processing Center, immigrants charged as inadmissible to the U.S. be provided with a notice informing them they may have a right to a bond hearing because of the class-action ruling.

The notice explains that those who could be helped by the ruling include immigrants who were not apprehended upon arrival in the U.S., are not subject to mandatory detention because of certain criminal charges or convictions and are not in expedited removal proceedings that bypass judges.

The notice also says that because the Department of Homeland Security and the Tacoma Immigration Court are not following a federal judge’s ruling, those affected will likely have to file a habeas petition. For help, it refers people to the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

Cartwright additionally ordered the federal government to provide the nonprofit group with a weekly list of people who received the notice, along with their ICE arrest reports.

Adams said the new order would allow his organization to help more people but called it a stopgap measure that is not likely to change the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings. “I think they’ve already dug in their heels, and at this point, they are going to continue to defy the law,” he said.

He added he’s heard reports of immigration courts around the country denying bond hearings despite the national ruling out of California.

The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which lies within the Department of Justice to oversee immigration courts around the country, said it does not comment on litigation-related matters.

The Trump administration has appealed Cartwright’s initial ruling on bond hearings to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 4.

In his lengthy September order, Young ruled the government’s arrest and removal of international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views violated their free speech rights.
He said Noem and Rubio misused their office’s “sweeping powers” to “strike fear” into noncitizens to curb their protected political speech.
“The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the President of the United States have a fearful view of freedom,” Young said.
“A view that defines the freedom here in the United States by who’s excluded.","A Boston federal judge said he was struck by a “breathtaking” conspiracy involving Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to violate international students’ free speech rights as the court outlined a remedy.

Concluding in his view “one of the most important cases” ever heard in the court, Judge William G. Young railed against the cabinet secretaries’ participation in the government’s efforts to target non-citizen students and scholars for their protected pro-Palestine or anti-Israel speech.

“The big problem in this is: It’s that the cabinet secretaries and ostensibly the president of the United States are not honoring the First Amendment,” Young said, extending his review of his findings to the White House.

Young declined to hit the government with a broad injunction, but he said he would issue an order that would give noncitizen members of the academic groups that sued the government a “conclusive presumption” that any change to their immigration status was in retaliation for being involved in the litigation.

The government could overcome that presumption by providing evidence that it had appropriate reason to adjust the immigration status of the person who was a member of the American Association of University Professors or the Middle East Studies Association when it sued in March, the judge said.

In his lengthy September order, Young ruled the government’s arrest and removal of international students who expressed pro-Palestinian views violated their free speech rights. He said Noem and Rubio misused their office’s “sweeping powers” to “strike fear” into noncitizens to curb their protected political speech.

Young indicated he had no interest in an injunction that would have him indefinitely police the government’s conduct and is barred by the US Supreme Court’s limits on universal injunctions from applying the ruling beyond the parties here.

He told Department of Justice lawyer Paul Stone that the proposed order largely aligned with the government’s request for “care and restraint” in ordering any remedy. But the court’s inventive solution didn’t prove sufficient.

Stone said federal immigration law stands as a bar to such an order, which would trample on the system of administrative immigration courts that Congress put in place to adjudicate removals. The Department of Justice lawyer said the government’s position is no remedy should be entered.

Young sharply retorted: “The Secretary of Homeland Security in concert with the Secretary of State, approved by the President of the United States to violate the Constitutional rights of these people and you’re telling me there is no remedy? I respectfully disagree.”

He said the burden the order would put on the government was designed specifically because the “cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.”

Young, in his 47th year on the bench, opined on what caused the government to end up running an “unconstitutional conspiracy to pick off” noncitizen academics to chill their political speech.

“The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the President of the United States have a fearful view of freedom,” Young said. “A view that defines the freedom here in the United States by who’s excluded. It seems obvious from this record, these high officials for one thing are seeking to exclude everyone. It’s erroneous.”

The judge said he expects to issue the remedies ruling on Jan. 22.

Gavin Newsom said he does not support abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a week after a federal agent fatally shot a woman in Minnesota, sparking mass protests and reigniting a national debate about how to rein in the agency.

“I disagree,” Newsom told conservative pundit Ben Shapiro on a Thursday episode of the “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast. Shapiro asked if Newsom agreed with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who earlier this week tied the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies to a massive budget increase for ICE: “I want everybody to understand, the cuts to your health care are what’s paying for this…You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.”

Last week, ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good as she drove away from an anti-ICE demonstration in Minneapolis. Federal officials defended the shooting, claiming without evidence that Good was a “domestic terrorist” and had tried to “ram” Ross with her car.

Multiple eyewitnesses, videos, and local and state officials disputed that, and residents have protested as federal agents have continued to pour into the liberal city, conducting traffic stops, detaining people and shooting an additional person after Ross shot and killed Good.

The shooting has sparked questions about whether lawmakers should make it easier to sue ICE agents after they kill someone. Six federal prosecutors resigned after the U.S. Department of Justice directed them to investigate Good’s widow. President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would let him use military troops to quell protests.

In July, Congress passed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” which allocated ICE an extra $75 billion in funding to escalate deportation efforts while cutting federal funds for states that went towards public benefits like health care and food assistance.

Democrats plotting a political comeback in the November midterms have tried to capitalize on the public’s growing negative perception of ICE while avoiding the pitfalls of the unsuccessful “Defund the Police” movement that ignited in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.

Newsom, who has teased a potential run for president in 2028, told Shapiro he supports “comprehensive immigration reform,” but did not offer more specifics, a vague stance he has maintained throughout his political career.

As mayor of San Francisco, Newsom required police to report undocumented children charged with violent crimes to ICE. He later said in 2018 it was a regrettable compromise to protect San Francisco’s sanctuary city status following a high-profile shooting in which Edwin Ramos, an undocumented Salvadoran gang member, shot and killed a family of three after mistaking them for rival gang members.

Newsom says he supports California’s sanctuary status

Newsom told Shapiro he supports maintaining California’s sanctuary status, which means the state does not cooperate with investigations into undocumented residents.

The movement dates back to the 1980s, when cities like Berkeley welcomed Central American asylees fleeing civil wars in countries like El Salvador, where the U.S. supported a military dictatorship.

Newsom cited research showing sanctuary cities are not more violent than non-sanctuary cities: “I think it’s important to establish, because it’s not well established, sanctuary jurisdictions have lower crime rates than non-sanctuary jurisdictions. So this notion that it somehow increases crime is also, I think, contradicted on the basis of the facts.

”He also boasted to Shapiro that California cooperates with ICE to prosecute “dangerous criminals,” and that he has vetoed “multiple” legislative efforts to further limit state cooperation with the agency.

“When it comes to the issues of violent criminals, when it comes to felons, people that are being released from the largest state system in the United States of America, California cooperates,” Newsom said.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/hpzud5/picture308136835/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/PARAMOUNT-3-LA%20(1).jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:58:57.390610

According to a Minneapolis fire department incident report obtained by the Guardian, along with police records and 911 transcripts, paramedics arrived at the scene at about 9.42am on 7 January and found Good “unresponsive” in the driver’s seat of her car, “with blood on her face and torso”.

The report states that paramedics removed Good from the car and reported that she was “unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity”.

According to the report, paramedics identified two “apparent gunshot wounds” to the right side of her chest, another apparent gunshot wound “to the patient’s left forearm”, and a “possible gunshot wound with protruding tissue on the left side of the patient’s head”. The report also notes that she had “dilated pupils” and blood “discharging” from her left ear.

According to the report, responders moved Good down the block “for a more workable scene, better access for ambulances, and separation from an escalating scene involving law enforcement and bystanders”.

Paramedics began performing chest compressions and applied a tourniquet to Good’s left arm before transporting her to a nearby hospital. The report states that CPR was continued during transport.

Upon arrival at the hospital, the report states that paramedics continued chest compressions while hospital staff “assumed airway and ventilation responsibilities”. According to the report, “resuscitative efforts were discontinued at approximately 10.30am”.

The Guardian also obtained transcripts of multiple 911 calls related to the shooting. Records show that the first call to 911 came in at about 9.38am on 7 January, roughly one minute after the shots were fired.

In one call, a caller told the dispatcher that there were “a bunch of ICE agents on 33rd and Portland, they just shot a lady point-blank range in her car”.

When asked if the woman had been shot, the caller responded: “She’s fuckin’ dead. They fuckin’ shot her.”

Later in the call, the same caller said: “There’s 15 ICE agents and they shot her, like, ’cause she wouldn’t open her car door.”

Another caller reported witnessing “fired shots into a car” and told the dispatcher that “ICE fired shots into her windshield.”

Asked whether anyone had been hit, the caller, who told the dispatcher that they were now across the street, responded: “Yes, bleeding.”

Describing the incident, the caller said: “I saw an ICE officer fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked.

“I saw blood all over the driver, then the partner who was trying to provide assistance,” the caller said.

The dispatcher responded that help was on the way.

A separate 911 call appears to have come from someone who said they were calling on behalf of federal officers at the scene, requesting assistance from EMS and local police.

“We had officers stuck in a vehicle and we had agitators on scene,” the caller said, adding that there had been “shots fired by our locals”.

The caller said that they did not have a description of the shooter, and they were “just trying to get assistance”.

When asked by the operator where they were getting the information from, the caller said it was “from our local joint operation command center”, adding that “the officers on scene are relaying to us to get in contact with you guys”.

The dispatcher told the caller that “we have help on the way”.

The documents viewed by the Guardian also include communications among law enforcement and emergency personnel.

At 9.47am local time, a message read: “NEED CROWD CONTROL AND AREA BLOCKED OFF.”

Three minutes later another message stated, “CROWD NEEDS TO BE MOVED BACK,” followed seconds later by: “CROWD GETTING HOSTILE.”

At 10.04am, roughly 15 minutes after the shooting, messages stated that the “AGENT THAT FIRED IS NO LONGER ON THE SCENE” and “HAS BEEN TRANSPORTED TO FEDERAL BLDG”.

At 10.07am, a message read: “CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE.”

At 10.20am, a message described the crowd as “GETTING MORE AGITATED” and, several minutes later, the communications stated that there was a “CROWD OF 20” attempting to “SURROUND OFCRS”.

At 11:01am, the communications stated: “ICE BEING SURROUNDED.”

And then at 11.20, it stated that “ALL ICE AGENTS HAVE LEFT SCENE” and about 18 minutes later it added: “CROWD CALMED DOWN NOW THAT ICE IS GONE.”

Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have claimed that the agent who shot and killed Good, identified as Jonathan Ross, acted in self-defense, and they have accused Good of trying to “run him over”.

That account of the incident has been widely disputed by local and state leaders in Minnesota as well as by eyewitnesses. Video footage of the shooting appears to show Good’s vehicle turning away from the officer as he opened fire.

Good’s killing has sparked protests in Minneapolis and in other cities across the US. And on Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota in response to the protests against federal immigration enforcement operation, as Minnesota’s governor, Tim Walz, a Democrat, urged demonstrators in Minneapolis to be peaceful amid escalating tensions there.

Last week, our country bore witness to the depths of ICE’s cruelty. We saw a masked agent shoot into a vehicle that was driving away, murdering Renee Nicole Good — a mother and American citizen.

This week, here in New Jersey, a high school student in Morristown was doing his family’s laundry when he was taken by masked and armed agents. In the same ICE sweep, a Morristown father was snatched on his way to pick up food for himself and his 6 year old daughter Annabella. His daughter was found walking the streets by herself and crying looking for her father hours later. The following day, ICE agents pulled Warren residents from their cars.

New Jersey has to do more to protect our communities from a rogue immigration enforcement agency that violates people’s constitutional rights. And if we’re looking for a roadmap, we don’t have to look far.

During the first Trump administration, an immigrant rights movement blossomed in New Jersey, finding a strong partner in Governor Phil Murphy. We won 10 pro-immigrant laws in Murphy’s first four years, and we became a state where immigrants could move freely, go to college, get occupational licenses, and have access to a lawyer. Basically, anything a state could do to protect immigrants, we did it, and it made New Jersey a safe and welcoming place for all.

Now, the stakes are even higher, with an emboldened Trump administration and his paramilitary force that shows no regard for the law or basic human rights.

New Jersey is one of the most diverse states in the nation, and immigrants are an essential part of our social and economic fabric. Immigrants make up almost a third of the state’s workforce and bring in billions in tax revenue. More than four out of every ten children in the state have at least one immigrant parent. And as the murder of Renee Nicole Good showed us, immigrant or not, no one is safe when ICE comes into town.

At this moment, families all across New Jersey are feeling the pain of ICE’s attacks. Our state has the most ICE detention beds on the entire East coast, and the Department of Homeland Security is looking to expand into the military base in Fort Dix and a warehouse in Roxbury.

Over 6,000 New Jersey residents have been detained and separated from their families since Trump took office a year ago, held in filthy conditions with no access to adequate food, medical care, legal help, or hope. In 2025 alone, 32 people have died in ICE custody, including Jean Wilson Brutus, who died at Delaney Hall in Newark.

This violence, damage, and destruction will only get worse. The DHS budget will grow to $170 billion this year, which is bigger than most countries’ militaries. ICE is increasingly using AI and surveillance technology to track people through their phones and their license plates. ICE is going door-to-door in neighborhoods, pushing their way into private homes and committing blatant civil rights violations. They are arresting US citizens and immigrants alike without warrants.

ICE cannot be trusted on our streets or in our communities, and New Jersey has to step up.

In his final days as governor, Governor Murphy has the opportunity to do just that. There is a package of immigrant protection bills on the governor’s desk that would keep our communities safe and cement his legacy as a champion for fairness and opportunity for all.

The Safe Communities Act (A6308/S5036) provides guidance to sensitive locations like schools, hospitals, and libraries — creating state level model policies to protect safe access to essential services for all New Jerseyans.

The Privacy Protection Act (A6309/S5037) limits when government agencies can collect immigration status information, and restricts the Motor Vehicle Commission from sharing data with ICE — protecting the privacy of millions of New Jerseyans from federal overreach.

Finally, A6310/S5038, which limits local law enforcement from aiding and abetting ICE’s abuses, would codify and strengthen the protections Governor Murphy himself oversaw seven years ago.

As he did during the first Trump administration, Governor Murphy must once again meet the moment and sign these bills into law. Given the escalating violence at the hands of ICE — and the threats yet to come — there is no other choice.

‘No judicial warrant’

What we know:

U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Bryan found that the arrest of Liberian immigrant Garrison Gibson violated his Fourth Amendment rights.

The judge ordered Gibson's immediate release from ICE custody, as the arrest was conducted without a judicial warrant.

Gibson was arrested last weekend in his north Minneapolis home when armed federal agents used a battering ram to bust open the family’s front door. The agents had only administrative paperwork, not the required judicial warrant to breach private property.

""To arrest him, Respondents forcibly entered Garrison G.’s home without his consent and without a judicial warrant,"" wrote Judge Bryan in his nine-page order. ""This arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. For this independent reason, Garrison G.’s detention is unlawful, and the Court orders his immediate release.""

Arrest caught on camera

The backstory:

Cameras captured the chaotic scene as armed federal agents broke into Gibson's home.

His loved ones streamed the incident live on social media, demanding to see a judicial warrant that would have allowed the entry. But the immigration enforcement officers on scene only presented administrative paperwork.

Gibson's attorneys immediately filed a habeas petition in federal court, leading to the judge's ruling.

Under immigration supervision for 15+ years

Dig deeper:

According to court filings, Gibson is a 38-year-old Liberian citizen, who has a final immigration removal order dating back to 2009.

But he was living under immigration supervision in the United States for more than 15 years with a past drug conviction that has been cleared from his record.

His attorney says Gibson had just checked in with ICE officials approximately two weeks prior to his arrest and had another meeting on the calendar at the end of the month. In his order, Judge Bryan added that Gibson’s compliance with immigration officials included ""submitting to ankle monitoring.""

In a statement to the FOX 9 Investigators earlier in the week, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin referred to Gibson as a ""criminal illegal alien from Liberia"" with a lengthy rap sheet that included robbery, drug possession with the intent to sell, possession of a deadly weapon, malicious destruction and theft. She promised, ""This criminal will remain in ICE custody pending removal,""

However, in his Thursday ruling, Judge Bryan found that ""Garrison G. has no criminal record.""

Gibson released from ICE custoy

What's next:

Judge Bryan gave ICE and the Department of Homeland Security until noon on Friday to release Gibson.

His family says, Gibson had been locked up in the Freeborn County jail in Albert Lea for the last several days. The judge also ruled that Gibson’s legal team is eligible to seek attorney’s fees and costs incurred in fighting for his release under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, one CBS News staffer said.
“I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.
“A bruise is internal bleeding.
“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said.","Some CBS News employees expressed concern after the network cited two anonymous “US officials” on Wednesday to report that the ICE officer who fatally shot Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis “suffered internal bleeding to the torso” after the incident.

CBS initially published the account about officer Jonathan Ross on X, formerly Twitter. About 30 minutes later, the network followed up with another post, containing a link to an article by two correspondents that similarly cited “two US officials briefed on his medical condition”.

The report, which was not extensively covered by other news organizations, drew an immediate response on social media from critics who questioned the network’s sourcing – and whether it aligned with the Trump administration’s preferred focus.

But there was also internal skepticism at the network about the report, according to emails viewed by the Guardian. It was met with “huge internal concern” by some, one CBS News staffer said. Others viewed the conversations as standard editorial discussions.

Before the original report was published, a medical producer at the network suggested in an email to colleagues that “it would be helpful to ask what type of treatment he received”, and whether the officer received surgery or any other type of procedure.

In another email, an executive expressed skepticism about the broad nature of the medical diagnosis, and what it actually entailed. “I’m no doctor, but internal bleeding is a very broad term and can range in severity,” wrote CBS News senior vice-president David Reiter.

“A bruise is internal bleeding. But it can also be something serious,” Reiter continued. “We do know that the ICE agent walked away from the incident – we have that on camera.” (The network’s story noted that “videos from the scene showed Ross walking away after the incident”.)

The network’s top editor, Bari Weiss, expressed a high level of interest in the story on an editorial call on Wednesday morning, according to staffers who listened.

“There was big internal dissension about the ‘internal bleeding’ report here last night,” the CBS News staffer, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said. “It was viewed as a thinly veiled, anonymous leak by [the Trump administration] to someone who’d carry it online.”

“Felt to many here like we were carrying water for the admin’s justifying of the shooting to keep our access to our sources,” said a second network staffer, who was also not authorized to comment.

In a statement, a CBS News spokesperson said the network “went through its rigorous editorial process and decided it was reportable based on the reporting, the reporters, and the sourcing”.

CBS, which labeled its story as an “exclusive”, was not totally alone on the story. The ABC News live blog published a two-paragraph update repeating the claim and citing “multiple US officials familiar with [Ross’s] medical condition” – but noting that the officials “didn’t provide more details about the medical condition”.

Other news organizations, including NBC News and the New York Times, also made brief mentions of the claim. Fox News, which published a full story, cited a confirmation from the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin – though it acknowledged that “the extent of the bleeding … was not immediately clear”.

The Guardian has not independently confirmed the report.

Since Weiss took over as editor-in-chief in early October, the network has faced accusations of favoritism toward the Trump administration. CBS has been controlled since last year by Paramount Skydance, the media conglomerate heavily bankrolled by the tech billionaire and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, a friend of the president.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f66fbaa8db4492db4d61bc41a9a5c6975bbbab/0_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a7dea27b9e854ac35a9713ababba6612",N,,2026-01-16 12:59:18.250298

Britain Rodriguez, 31, a resident of Orange County, said he was standing at the bottom of some steps with other demonstrators when federal officers above opened fire at them, hitting him in the face.

“I remember hitting the ground and feeling like my eye exploded in my head,” he said.

In a video his girlfriend shared with The Times, Rodriguez can be seen on the ground, holding his face as he screams in agony before demonstrators escorted him from the area.

“I can’t see, I got shot in the eye, I can’t see,” Rodriguez says before noticing blood on his hand. “I’m bleeding.”

Rodriguez and his girlfriend, Ale, who declined to give her last name, said the officers gave no warning before firing at them. She said she was hit in the chest with a less-lethal round but was not injured.

“That’s when I started yelling at them,” she said. “I’m like holding a sign that says, ‘Stop kidnapping my neighbors’ and a candle; I am no threat to any of [those] guys.”

She said after getting shot she heard her boyfriend screaming.

The video suggests Rodriguez was struck at the same time that 21-year-old Kaden Rummler was hit in the face. Rodriguez can be heard screaming in the background just as Rummler falls to the ground.

In a statement released by Rummler this week and read by a member of the social justice organization Dare to Struggle, which organized one of the protests that day, he said doctors found pieces of plastic and glass in his skull as well as metal in his stomach lining, and pulled a piece of plastic “the size of a nickel” from his injured eye.

Rummler said a piece of metal got lodged millimeters from his carotid artery, and doctors were unable to remove some of the shrapnel from his skull.

He said the DHS officers did not call paramedics right away and at one point pushed his face into a pool of his own blood.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary with the Department of Homeland Security, played down the injury and denied the allegations in statements to The Times this week.

“This is absurd,” she wrote. “DHS law enforcement took this rioter to the hospital for a cut and he was released that night.”

McLaughlin said “a mob of about 60 rioters threw rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement officers.” She said two officers were injured but did not say how or what their injuries were. She said two people were arrested and charged with assault on a federal officer and disorderly conduct.

“This was a highly coordinated campaign of violence where rioters wielded shields,” she said. “Make no mistake, rioting and assaulting law enforcement is not only dangerous but a crime.”

Videos of Friday’s incident shared on social media do not reflect McLaughlin’s version of events.

In Santa Ana, hundreds gathered that night to protest the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a Minnesota mother of three, and the Trump administration’s mass deportations. Some were there to speak out against police brutality in general. Protesters marched in the downtown area chanting, “ICE out of O.C.,” and held up signs that read, “No more raids, keep families together” and “Stop the deportations.”

An earlier protest started at 3 p.m. and was organized by Dare to Struggle, according to Connor Atwood, a member of the group. Atwood, who was present, said the scene turned chaotic as the protest began to wind down and the crowd dwindled.

One video shows demonstrators throwing orange traffic cones at the federal officers, who were standing guard outside the entrance to the Santa Ana federal building.

Rodriguez, his girlfriend and other demonstrators said the cones never came close to hitting the officers. They said there were no bottles or rocks thrown and they saw no one holding shields.

A spokesperson for the Santa Ana Police Department said the only physical confrontation by protesters they were aware of that night was the tossing of orange cones at the federal officers.

The video cuts to three DHS officers approaching the group before one tries to take a young person — identified by friends as Skye Jones — into custody, prompting at least three demonstrators to try to intervene. As one officer struggles to apprehend Jones, two others fire less-lethal rounds at the crowd, hitting one woman in the leg and Rummler in the face.

The video shows Rummler dropping to the ground, holding his face as the crowd retreats. An officer then drags him by the hood of his jacket. Rummler appears to be choking, grasping at the jacket around his neck as blood pours from his left eye.

The clash outside of the federal building is part of a number of controversial confrontations that sparked nationwide protests and raised concerns about the use of violence by federal immigration agents.

Santa Ana Mayor Pro Tem Benjamin Vazquez said he was troubled by what took place outside of the federal building on Jan. 9 and called the federal officers’ actions “deplorable.”

“Shooting any kind of projectile into somebody’s face could lead to death,” he said.

Vazquez said it appears the agents did not try to de-escalate the situation or attempt to go inside the building where it would have been safer.

“The building is a fortress, it’s got thick concrete walls,” he said. “It’s clearly built to take on a simple signs, water bottles, even rubber cones.”

“There was no need for them to come out of the building,” he added. “The violence doesn’t match the protests.”

Sitting on his living room couch this week, Rodriguez said doctors told him the projectile that hit him in his eye damaged his iris, cornea and lens. He developed a cataract too.

On a small table, sealed in a Ziploc bag, were pieces of the projectile he suspects he may have been hit with. The pieces appear to be part of a round plastic pellet that was filled with a pinkish powder.

Rodriguez doesn’t know how much of his vision, if any, he’ll be able to get back. He said doctors told him he’ll require surgery to remove the cataract before they can determine that. He said he’s been unable to work or drive.

Rodriguez works at an after-school program in Orange County and supervises third graders. He said he drives a school van to drop students at their homes or stops, but now he may not be able to do that.

The injury has altered his life as a working artist, making it difficult to read, write and paint. He said distinguishing some colors on the palette has been challenging.

“The first day when I tried to paint was frustrating,” he said. “ “I couldn’t distinguish between brown and purple for a little bit.”

Rodriguez said he’s gone through a mix of emotions since the shooting. He hopes he’ll get to thank the man who provided medical care to him before his girlfriend drove him to the hospital. He feels sad that Rummler lost vision in his left eye too. And he said he’s angry that people are being harmed and that their constitutional rights are being violated by federal authorities.

“All of America should be outraged right now, you know, we should all be very upset at minimum,” he said. “Because as far as I’m concerned, I was doing something legitimate and for a legitimate reason, you know, like a civilian was murdered by somebody who seemingly cannot get prosecuted and more than likely won’t get prosecuted, which is why I was out there.

“When I heal up, I’m gonna be back out there, protesting against this, because this makes me sick. This is not the country that I want to live in.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5f2c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1586x833+0+241/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F74%2Fbb7ee68645d18d488f104409868a%2F1537835-me-santa-ana-protester-shot-in-face-ajs-04.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:58:57.485024

On Thursday, Rev. Dr. Gabriel Salguero, the leader of the Gathering Place, an Evangelical Latino congregation in Orlando, said he’s also hearing from his members and other Chaplains that there’s a heavier presence of ICF in communities, along with arrests.

“Detentions have risen,” he said. “(Chaplains) have said, many of those people are immigrants.”

Salguero was joined by a room full of faith leaders from Central Florida, advocating for the safety of immigrants in their communities.

“We call for due process. The human and civil rights of immigrants should be respected. We believe in their human and civil rights. They should do all things with due process,” he said.

The impact of more ICE arrests can best be seen at the Orange County Corrections Department. According to a new report, the average daily population of inmates arrested by ICE without any other local charge, or arrested by another agency, increased by 930% from Dec. 2024 to the end of 2025.

Arrests have increased recently as well, with a 33% increase from November to December.

“They are not criminals. They have not committed a crime other than they got entangled in a very broken immigration system, and they are coming in and being booked into Orange County jail,” said District 1 Commissioner Nicole Wilson, who was present at the Thursday press conference.

Commissioner Wilson noted the uptick in arrests and also repeat bookings made.

“These repeat bookings occur when an inmate is held for 72 hours, transferred to ICE custody, and subsequently returned, because they get to restart that 72-hour hold. So we're essentially being used as a detention facility,” she said.

On Thursday, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Alejandro Frost posted on social media about reports of increased ICE activity in parts of Orange County, urging residents to remember their rights.

“We’ve also received reports of heavy ice activity at certain hotels in the area, as well,” Frost said. “They have made pretty large hotel reservations in surrounding hotels, as well.”

Central Florida Public Media has not independently verified those claims.

During the gathering on Thursday, Salguero stated that his church has provided information in both English and Spanish on how to respond if there is an immigration action in a sensitive location. He is also advocating for peaceful protests against current ICE policies.

“We do not want to see any replication of what's happened in Minnesota and Chicago and elsewhere,” he said. “For pastors, life is sacred. That means the life of immigrants. The life of law enforcement, but also the quality of life of our community.”

Pastor Sarah Robinson leads the Audubon Park Covenant Church and joined Rev. Salguero and other leaders on Thursday.

“Stepping up and saying loud and clear and definitively, ‘we evangelicals, we see what's going on, and it's not okay.’ That's a really big deal,” she said.

Salguero acknowledged that there is a narrative painted around Evangelicals, suggesting they approve of ICE operations.

DOES THE LAW ALLOW PEOPLE TO SUE ICE AGENTS?

U.S. law makes it very difficult to sue federal agents as individuals. But victims can sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work.

This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity which usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In a FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully.

The statute might apply, for example, if an ICE agent damaged vehicles during an enforcement action. The statute would also allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

Several FTCA cases in the last year have drawn attention to the relatively obscure statute, which allows suits by citizens and non-citizens.

Jessie Fuentes, an elected official in Chicago who was handcuffed by ICE agents last year, recently used the FTCA to seek $100,000 in damages over the incident. That claim is pending.

Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist detained by ICE, and a Venezuelan man sent by U.S. authorities to a Salvadoran megaprison also have brought FTCA claims.

WHAT HURDLES DO THESE CASES FACE?

While the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.

Plaintiffs cannot seek punitive damages and do not have the right to a jury trial. Awards are also capped by the laws of the state where the wrongdoing occurred.

So, compensation can often be much lower than in traditional civil liability cases.

Additionally, the government cannot be held liable for discretionary judgments made by federal employees.

That means the government can defeat a claim by showing federal workers had to make judgment calls rather than follow standard procedures.

The government can also win by convincing a judge that the employee's actions were reasonable. In Good's case, the government would likely argue that the ICE agent who killed her acted in self-defense.

CAN FEDERAL AGENTS BE SUED INDIVIDUALLY?

Federal agents can only be sued individually in very limited circumstances when they violate the U.S. Constitution, and even then, such suits rarely succeed.

In a landmark 1971 case, Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a Brooklyn man to sue federal agents who searched his home without a warrant.

The court said the man's right to sue the agents for money damages was implied in the U.S. Constitution, even though there was no specific law passed by Congress authorizing such a claim.

That ruling created a type of lawsuit known as a Bivens action, in which federal employees who violate the U.S. Constitution can be sued in their personal capacity and forced to pay monetary damages.

But U.S. courts only recognize Bivens actions in very limited contexts, and in 2022, prohibited such claims against federal border agents conducting immigration enforcement.

Those more recent rulings have made it nearly impossible to sue federal officers like ICE agents in their individual capacity.

WHAT ABOUT CRIMINAL LIABILITY?

The bar against criminal prosecution of federal law enforcement officers such as ICE agents is very high and indictments are rare.

State-level prosecutors can file criminal charges against federal agents under certain circumstances. They would have to show that a federal agent's actions were outside the scope of their official duties, objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful.

“…there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon.","PORTLAND, Maine — Reactions are mounting across Maine after the mayors of the state’s two largest cities said federal immigration enforcement by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) could soon increase.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline announced that ICE may soon expand its presence in their communities, but federal officials and local law enforcement have not confirmed those reports.

The uncertainty has divided opinions among residents and public officials, with some expressing deep concern and others saying they are less worried about what an increased ICE presence might mean for Maine.

Portland resident Lucian Curtis voiced concern about what he’s heard and seen from immigration enforcement actions in other states.

“I think it’s very concerning,” Curtis told NEWS CENTER Maine. ""That sort of presence that they’re trying to muster seems to be at no actual benefit to our community and our economy,” Curtis said.

Not everyone shares those concerns. Republican State Senator Matt Harrington (R‑York) said Maine’s situation is not likely to mirror high‑profile enforcement seen in other states.

“I think we have a lot fewer people,” Harrington said, suggesting that the number of undocumented individuals in Maine is much lower than in other parts of the country.

“If there are folks that have been identified [as] being here illegally, I do fully support federal immigration authorities enforcing the law,” added Harrington.

“…Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods,” Dion’s statement read.

In Lewiston, Sheline urged residents and local businesses to understand their rights and prepare for possible encounters with ICE.

“…there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them…” Sheline wrote.

The mayors’ announcements came the day after President Donald Trump referenced Maine’s Somali population in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, saying fraud is “going on in Maine, too.”

According to Michael, on Jan. 6, Parady La asked his cousin if she needed anything from the grocery store.
They’re questioning why NARCAN, which is used for opioid overdoses, was administered to Parady La when he was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.","Michael La, 34, has “a lot of memories” from the summers he spent as a child with his uncle, Parady La, who died Jan. 9 while in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.

“He was like a father figure to me,” Michael said of his uncle. “My parents split up at a really early age of my life. I was a baby, so I didn’t get to see my two parents together, and my dad really wasn’t in my life, right? So [Parady] was the one that connected me to that side of my family.”

Parady La would drive two hours to Michael’s home in Allentown and bring him back to Philadelphia during Michael’s summer vacation. There, Michael recalled that his uncle would give him and other kids money for ice cream when the Mister Softee truck came by.

“He always put himself aside and looked out for his family,” Michael said.

Michael and Parady La’s other family members, friends and loved ones are mourning his loss and celebrating his life at a memorial service in Upper Darby on Friday, even as they push for information about the circumstances that led to the 46-year-old’s death last week.

Michael started a GoFundMe for the family to help pay for funeral expenses and support Parady La’s 23-year-old daughter, Jazmine La. Donations will also go toward the family’s efforts to pursue legal action against ICE and Federal Detention Center Philadelphia.

What happened to Parady La?

According to Michael, on Jan. 6, Parady La asked his cousin if she needed anything from the grocery store. Hours later, family members found his car, empty, parked by the side of the road a half-mile away. Parady La called later that day and informed his family that ICE agents had pulled him over and asked for his ID, and then detained him.

Michael, who lives in Florida, said his cousin called him at 3:30 p.m. on Jan. 8 and told him Parady La was in the hospital, and was brain dead.

“One thing is huge, is that your family member, who’s been here their whole life … that he’s being sent to a country he’s never been to before,” he said. “So we’re dealing with that in 24 hours, and a little after 24 hours, we hear that he’s in the hospital, brain dead. So it’s just shocking and really confusing on top of that.”

According to a Jan. 10 statement by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Parady La was “receiving treatment for severe drug withdrawal” while in detention at FDC Philadelphia. On Jan. 7, the statement reads, Parady “was found unresponsive in his cell.” The statement said that FDC officers administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance.

Parady La was admitted to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital that evening in critical condition, and pronounced dead the morning of Jan. 9, ICE officials said.

For Michael and Parady La’s family, ICE’s account “didn’t add up.”

Michael, who flew into Philadelphia hours after his uncle passed away, said his family’s understanding is that Parady La informed officers that he was going through fentanyl withdrawal soon after he was detained. They’re questioning why NARCAN, which is used for opioid overdoses, was administered to Parady La when he was experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” he said. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”

Michael said his family now has a legal team and is going to pursue legal action against FDC Philadelphia and ICE.

“This fight isn’t about deportation,” Michael said. “It’s about the care that each and every person needs when they are in custody, whether it is in ICE custody, FDC, or, you know, a different federal agency … If you bring somebody in your home, I feel like it’s your duty to make sure that they’re cared for in your home.”

Shut Down Detention Campaign, a coalition of organizations and individuals fighting to end immigrant detention, said in a press statement that Parady La’s death was “completely preventable and is a direct result of egregious medical neglect.” According to the group, “several sources” said that Parady La “told staff he was going through fentanyl withdrawal and repeatedly requested care after vomiting several times throughout January 6th.”

In its statement about Parady La’s death, ICE said it “is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.”

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay … At no time during detention is a detained alien denied emergency care,” the statement reads.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/parady-la-ice-death.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:59:40.105892

I am in the passenger seat of a stranger’s car in Minneapolis, four days after Renee Nicole Good was killed here. I’m riding with someone who was doing the same kind of work we think Good was doing when an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot her. Right now, our work is much quieter. We’re driving in loose loops when a volunteer who is patrolling the streets as a pedestrian observer on the Signal call we’re listening to—a broad network of thousands of locals relaying up-to-the-moment intel on ICE activity—reports two vehicles near Karmel Mall, known locally as “Somali Mall.” Another volunteer fulfilling the role of dispatcher, also on the call, identifies them by make and model. Another observer cross-references the license plates against a running database. They’re confirmed as ICE vehicles, unmarked like they almost always are.

My guide for the day, who I’ll call C, sits up. “They’re going to come past us right here,” they say, accelerating toward the intersection.

Within seconds we spot them: two SUVs moving faster than the flow of traffic. Through their windows, I can see silhouettes of men with heavy Kevlar high on the neck, faces covered, sunglasses.

C begins calling out every turn, street, and direction the SUVs take—while laying on their car horn hard and continuously, like an alarm. The sound is constant and blunt. It could easily be mistaken for an expression of anger, but watching how others in the area—pedestrians, other drivers—react, it’s a signal: a warning to anyone within earshot that ICE is moving through the neighborhood. It turns what ICE hoped would be a discreet operation into a public event. One pedestrian we pass hears the horn, turns, and gives the ICE vehicles the finger.

The SUVs accelerate. We follow closely, C still honking, still relaying their movements. Then they turn onto a familiar street.

“This is my street,” C says. Their posture changes. They look at me. “Can you record this?”

At the next stop sign, the vehicles split. One SUV pauses, blocking our path, allowing the other to pull away, surging into the intersection, cutting ahead of an uninvolved civilian car, using it as a moving barrier. If C had chased through, we would have been hit broadside: “They have absolutely no respect for traffic laws.” That first SUV is gone.

“They sometimes travel in pairs,” C tells me. “You can’t follow both. They’ll break and try to shake anyone observing.”

The remaining ICE vehicle, a Wagoneer, continues through the block. C keeps honking, keeps calling turns. We circle again. “They’re letting me pass my house again,” they report into Signal.

Then: “They’re stopped in front of my house.”

The first thing I noticed when I got to Minneapolis last weekend was the new language. For example: The work C was doing has a name—“commuting”—a deliberately mundane term for pursuing, tailing, and deliberately irritating ICE agents moving through the city in unmarked cars.

As C scans windshields, front seats, and license plates, they tell me about a recent incident near their home. “Three blocks from my house, an unmarked vehicle with four agents in it roll up and just grab a guy off the sidewalk who was walking,” they said. “They violently shoved him into their car.” Their voice trembles as they describe the incident, one they managed to film, hoping that footage might be useful later. “They just snatched him.”

That verb—snatched—is another example of the new language. So is “abduction.” Both are meant to describe the force, speed, and chaos with which ICE is removing people from their city. People are taken before anyone nearby understands what’s happening.

It’s a mistake to think that this transformation started after Good’s killing. The ICE raids intensified in Minneapolis in early December, and the Signal network C volunteers in has been active since then. Minneapolis had already been in an ongoing battle between ICE and the local residents for months when Good was killed.

Her death also occurred just a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020, an area now dubbed George Floyd Square. The past five years taught this city what it looks like when official accounts collide with video evidence, with witness testimony, with what residents say they watched happen with their own eyes. People I met kept describing this as a reason the infrastructure exists at all: not as a guarantee of safety, but as a way to create a record.

Now, in this frozen tundra of a city, in a state best known for its enduring Midwestern niceness, residents of Minnesota are doubling down.

Since Dec. 1, growth in these networks had been steady. After Renee Good was killed, it exploded. Volunteer residents told me that up until the shooting, roughly 20 people would join every day. Now, it’s hundreds.

I came to Minneapolis to understand what it looks like when a city organizes not around a single protest or flashpoint, but around a daily pattern of federal enforcement that residents describe as their new normal. People kept telling me the same thing: The city has a new infrastructure now, mostly invisible unless you’re inside it. C offered to show me what that looks like in real time.

“When I started in early December,” C tells me, “it was not at all guaranteed to see an ICE agent during patrols.” They pause. “Now I see anywhere from one to upwards of 20 if I’m out for even an hour.”

That morning, C picked me up near the intersection where Good was shot and killed. Like George Floyd Square, the response here had been immediate and spatial. In the first days after her death, neighbors used debris to block the roads, closing the intersection in every direction. For a brief window, the intersection functioned the way so many Minneapolis corners have learned to function: part memorial, part staging ground—an assertion that something had happened here and could not simply be folded back into normal traffic patterns.

By the time I arrived on Saturday morning, the barricades were gone. Traffic had resumed. The memorial had been compressed into the parking lane of the one-way street, clustered near where Good’s SUV had crashed into a parked car. Flowers lined the curb. Candles flickered in the cold. Handwritten signs were fixed to fences and utility poles. The street felt reopened but not reset.

Nearby, a small group of friends arrived together, standing shoulder to shoulder as they took in the memorial. One of them, Kylie, told me she’s still in shock. “On our way here, we watched ICE take somebody from their home. Like 30 minutes ago. They broke her window and took her out of her house.”

That mourners could witness such actions so close to the scene of Good’s death is as useful an indication as any about how things are going in Minneapolis. By most accounts, tensions have only continued to ratchet higher. I flew home on Monday, and on Wednesday another altercation between ICE, a Venezuelan man, and two civilians attempting to prevent the agents from arresting the man resulted in ICE shooting the man they were attempting to arrest in the leg. The two civilians were reportedly “armed” with a snow shovel and a broom, and the incident is being held up as the reason Donald Trump is now floating using the Insurrection Act to enter the city. Meanwhile, Keith Ellison, the state’s attorney general, told residents to continue to report possible rights violations and other incidents involving federal law enforcement. People I spoke to described the escalation as cause to organize even harder.

That effort continues to be diffuse. The way anonymity is central to how this work functions makes it hard to know specifically who Good was collaborating with when she was killed. The volunteer network is also extremely local and largely homegrown, built by neighbors organizing block by block with the families who live next door. Their stories said a lot about how someone like Good may have gotten involved.

Nick is a local father in South Minneapolis. He’s also an admin in one of the neighborhood-level Signal networks that routes ICE sightings into local response. He told me that he got involved around Dec. 1, when ICE activity in his area started to feel constant. “That was the day that it really sort of got out of hand,” he told me. That day, he said, a neighbor was taken. Then ICE returned. Then they returned again. “When they came back for a third time, we were organized. We were out there watching, whistling. … It’s been like that ever since.”

He ended up on the helm of his particular neighborhood’s efforts largely by default. “I guess I’m very online,” he told me. “I know how to do some technical stuff. So I just kind of took over as one of the admins.” His chat has become an invaluable tool for locals who want to track and observe ICE. Volunteers cross-check license plates against a database of confirmed ICE vehicles, dispatchers track ICE activity, observers patrolling on foot or in vehicles give up-to-the-moment information of ICE whereabouts. He wanted one thing understood immediately: This is not a professional operation. “It is just ordinary people that are doing this,” he said. “This isn’t fun. It’s middle-aged parents who would rather be playing with their kids at home.”

Nick also wasn’t keen on comparing this moment to how he experienced the uprising that followed the killing of George Floyd. He said the two are different in that that was a single instance, and now they see videos of inhumane treatment and police brutality dozens of times a day in their neighborhoods.

Back in the car with C, as we drive in more slow loops, they give me a tour of the city they call home, and clearly love. But in almost in the same breath, they point out places that have become markers in this new geography of enforcement.

“That fish-and-chicken spot,” they say, gesturing, “that’s where [ICE] were initially staging.”

The Signal call runs constantly in the background. The cadence of volunteers is efficient and clipped. C describes what they look for: SUVs and pickups parked in alleys; heavily tinted windows; out-of-state plates; erratic driving; the outline of tactical vests and sunglasses. It has become reflexive, they say, to glance into nearly every vehicle.

Even while so much of the action seems like it is being done car-to-car, people kept telling me the system is bigger than patrols. Volunteers are doing everything they can to keep vulnerable residents from having to be anywhere ICE might be. This means doing things like getting anyone who is trying to avoid ICE’s scrutiny rides, child care, groceries. To understand this part of the work, people told me, I should talk to Anna, who is running one such effort called Neighbors Helping Neighbors.

Anna talked the way people do when they’ve been in crisis mode for too long: fast, specific, typing into her phone without interrupting. In her telling, the last two months didn’t introduce a new fear so much as spread it—turning what many immigrant neighbors have lived with for years into a shared civic atmosphere.

Her days now revolve around a simple system: a form for volunteers, another form for neighbors asking for help. “On average, I would say a week ago we were getting three to five a day,” she said. “Last night from 3 p.m. to this morning we’ve received 51.” The requests were spreading outward into the suburbs—“Farmington … Roseville, Inver Grove Heights, Eden Prairie”—and it’s still intensifying.

When I asked where Neighbors Helping Neighbors came from, she described it as improvised and immediate: “We just started brainstorming and I literally just created a Google form and we just shared it on social media and now it has just become a thing.” It stayed informal even as it grew. “People are like, ‘Who can I Venmo?’ ” she said. “And I’m like, ‘You can Venmo me.’ ” Someone would send her a receipt, and she’d reimburse them. “I don’t know who they are,” she said. “And I’m just Venmoing them.”

She talked about it as mutual aid built in real time, held together by trust and speed, and by a kind of local reflex that Minnesota has rehearsed in smaller ways for years—neighbors pushing each other out of snowdrifts, shoveling sidewalks, checking in. “You have to know your neighbors,” she said. “You need to know their names.”

Neighbors are showing up in droves. Organizers told me their Signal chats were maxing out. Trainings are full. Food pantries were being inundated. And even after the horror of Good’s killing, the new volunteers weren’t seasoned activists, they were regular people who finally reached a point where doing nothing felt worse than the risks of doing something.

Jordan Castillo attended his first training at a church in South Minneapolis on the same day Renee Good was killed. He arrived already unsettled. He remembers murmuring “Holy shit” when he got to the packed parking lot. Inside, he estimated there were “probably about 700 people.” He stopped when he walked in. “I was like, whoa. This is a moment. Like, this is history.”

But Good’s killing isn’t the only thing pulling people in—many volunteers are coming to this work after seeing ICE in their own neighborhoods. When I met Burt Muston in a park near his home, he pointed to the local market he described as “a neighborhood staple.” Two people were taken by ICE here. The market closed afterward. “They’ve been closed ever since.” That was the tipping point for him, he said.

Muston is a large white man, and with his beard and dark sunglasses, he could be mistaken for an ICE agent himself. He saw this as an advantage. “As, like, a big white dude … other than if they want to say I’m obstructing justice, they’re not going to really fuck with me,” he told me.

That doesn’t mean he doesn’t take the risks seriously—he referenced footage where an ICE agent told an observer, “Have you not learned your lesson when we kill that lesbian bitch?” He had already made contingency plans. “I’ve actually set up, if I do get detained or something like that, people to come grab my dog to take care of,” he said. Then he waved it off: “I’ll just cross that bridge if I come to it.”

I spoke to another volunteer, who I’ll call M, in a coffee shop at 7 a.m., just before she headed to another shift as a “commuter.” Responding to ICE-watch calls has become part of her routine—she’s been doing it before work, after getting training months ago. “I’m just getting out of bed in the morning and thinking, Maybe I should wake up earlier. Maybe I should leave the house at 6 a.m. so that I can help make sure that there are eyes on the road, eyes on the bus stop or by the schools.”

But the watching goes both ways. As I sit in the car with C after the second ICE vehicle sped off, the remaining Wagoneer idles midblock—right in front of C’s house. The message C took from it was simple: “We know where you live.” C keeps the horn down and raises a middle finger toward the windshield.

Moments later, the Wagoneer accelerates away on an icy stretch, blowing through a row of intersections with stop signs. C follows cautiously, choosing to stop instead, letting the distance span. The Wagoneer disappears. C scans mirrors, side streets, cross traffic. “I think we lost them,” they say.

“I lost it at the light,” they report to the group call. “If anyone’s further east on 31st past I-35 and can get eyes on it …” No one does.",https://compote.slate.com/images/de573e37-75e0-4a11-869d-351d850bcb56.jpeg?width=1560,N,,2026-01-16 11:01:14.903461

An April executive order threatened to revoke all federal funding to states and localities deemed to be “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
Starting with 9/11, it has been utilized during times of heightened immigration enforcement.
The federal government depends on local jails for detention space, and transfers people across the country to local jails that they pay a per diem.
In Kentucky, the increasing use of local jails for immigration detention puts pressure on an already-strained system rife with crowding and other poor, dangerous conditions.","A year in to the Trump presidency, the administration’s mass deportation effort has resulted in a historic high of 68,990 immigrants locked up in detention, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is becoming increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of arrests. Despite mounting public outrage and fear, however, a growing number of local police and jails in Kentucky are entering into agreements and contracts to cooperate with ICE. And Kentucky legislators are proposing ways to further ramp up deportation efforts across the state even as ICE arrests in the state surge and the number of detainees in local jails increases.

State and local governments play a central role in implementing this mass deportation agenda, which includes financial incentives for law enforcement agencies to formally partner with ICE and for jails to rent out beds for detention. In Kentucky, 22 local law enforcement groups have already signed 287(g) agreements and 11 county jails are contracting with ICE to hold detainees. That is an increase of 8 additional law enforcement groups and 2 more county jails just in the last few months. In addition, several bills have already been filed this legislative session that would require local agencies to participate.

States and localities play a key role in administration’s anti-immigrant agenda

During the campaign the Trump administration promised to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history and remove 15 to 20 million undocumented immigrants — a number greater than the 14 million estimated to live in the U.S. The administration is reportedly pressuring ICE to arrest 3,000 immigrants a day and deport a record one million each year.

On its very first day, the administration issued 10 executive orders and proclamations that set in motion a sweeping anti-immigrant policy agenda. The major executive order on immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, “Protecting the American People From Invasion,” included numerous policies designed to massively increase arrests and deportations, including requiring immigrants without citizenship register with the federal government or be subject to criminal prosecution.

The administration is utilizing state and local law enforcement to carry out its plan. The “Protecting the American People From Invasion” executive order directed DHS to expand 287(g) agreements with state and local law enforcement to mobilize them as partners in enforcing federal immigration law “to the maximum extent permitted by law.” In addition, ICE issued a separate set of standards in July for immigrant detention in facilities that already incarcerate people in state/local custody. These new standards reduced the number of required procedures and oversight compared to dedicated facilities, a strategy to expand immigrant detention in local jails by making it easier to enter into these agreements with ICE.

An April executive order threatened to revoke all federal funding to states and localities deemed to be “sanctuary” jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Louisville was on the Department of Justice’s published list of so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions because of a local ordinance preventing the jail from keeping someone in custody at the request of ICE (an “ICE detainer”) for as long as 48 hours after their scheduled release; the mayor later announced a reversal of its policy and Louisville was removed from this list.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBBA), the budget megabill that passed Congress in July, also appropriated $170.7 billion to carry out this anti-immigrant agenda, in addition to $75 billion for the enforcement, surveillance and militarization of borders.

22 Kentucky law enforcement agencies have already signed 287(g) agreements with ICE, three in the first week of the new year, with an additional contract pending

Section 287(g) was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1996, authorizing ICE to give state and local law enforcement officers the authority to enforce federal immigration law. Starting with 9/11, it has been utilized during times of heightened immigration enforcement.

During the first Trump administration, the number of 287(g) agreements nationally jumped from 35 to 150. There were 135 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) on Jan. 20, 2025, which surged to 1,036 October 1 and is now up to 1,318 across 40 states as of Jan. 13, 2026. New financial incentives in the OBBBA have been in effect since October 1 for state and local law enforcement agencies that participate, heightening long-held concerns about racial profiling, violence and other human and civil rights violations in the 287(g) program.

The majority of the agreements are the Task Force Model, which empowers state or local law enforcement to make immigration arrests during routine policing and was discontinued from 2012 until January 2025 due to documented civil rights abuses. As of Sept. 2, 2025, 8,501 Task Force officers had completed training and more than 2,000 additional officers were in training.

There are two other types of 287(g) agreements:

Jail Enforcement Model – Corrections officers are deputized by the federal government to interrogate people about their immigration status.

Warrant Service Officer Model – ICE trains, certifies and authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to serve and execute administrative immigration warrants on people who are in custody in their agency’s jail.

Both the Task Force Model and Jail Enforcement Model have historically required a four-week, in-person training program, while the more-limited Warrant Service Officer Model required just eight hours of training. However, in bringing back the Task Force Model the Trump administration is only requiring a 40-hour online training course, especially concerning given this model is the most aggressive and has a history of abuses.

In Kentucky, there are now 28 287(g) contracts across 22 different agencies, 18 of which are the problematic Task Force Model:

Twelve of the agreements happened after the OBBBA became law, all but two of which were for the Task Force Model. Since we first published this analysis in October of 2025, eight new 287(g) agreements have been entered into, all of which are the Task Force Model, and an additional Task Force Model contract is pending for the McCracken County Sheriff’s Office.

Prior to the OBBBA, local law enforcement agencies partnering with ICE received limited federal funds for expenses like training and IT infrastructure. However, DHS is now fully reimbursing participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each trained 287(g) officer; this includes covering overtime up to 25% of their annual salary. In addition, agencies can receive quarterly “performance bonuses”— not dissimilar to a bounty — based on the “successful location” of undocumented immigrants identified by ICE and “overall assistance to further ICE’s mission to defend the homeland.” Agencies that locate 90% to 100% of ICE-identified undocumented immigrants receive $1,000 per eligible task force officer, $750 per eligible task force officer for locating 80% to 89% of ICE-identified undocumented immigrants and $500 for locating 70% to 79%.

There were nearly 2,000 ICE arrests in Kentucky in the first nine months of the new administration, and the arrest rate is increasing

On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security issued a directive rescinding the Biden administration’s “protected areas policy” that prevented immigration enforcement in places like churches, schools and hospitals. ICE arrests surged nationally following the inauguration, with 32,809 between January 20 and March 10, the equivalent of about 656 arrests per day, compared to 255 each day under the previous administration. After ICE reportedly received orders on May 20 to further intensify their efforts and started targeting workplaces and immigration court, there was a peak of around 30,000 arrests in June 2025 compared to 8,000 in June 2024. That was the highest level since at least 2020 but still far below the goal of 3,000 per day, or roughly 90,000 a month. ICE arrests were lower in July and August but then increased to more than 33,000 in September.

ICE arrest data obtained, processed and made available by the Deportation Data Project, shows that in Kentucky, between Jan. 20, 2025 and Oct. 15, 2025, there were 1,950 ICE arrests. That’s a 32% increase compared to the 1,475 arrests in 2024 during the same period.

According to an analysis by the Prison Policy Initiative, the ICE arrest rate in Kentucky was 17.2 per 100,000 residents in the first four months of the Trump administration (Jan. 20 to May 20, 2025) and increased to 25.5 between May 21 and Oct. 15, 2025. During both time periods, 75% of the ICE arrests in Kentucky happened at a jail or other lockup facility and 25% occurred at workplaces, homes, courts or other non-carceral locations in the community.

As can be seen in the map below, jails are the most common location for ICE arrests in the state, especially those occurring outside of Louisville. The data also shows that for the people arrested by ICE in Kentucky between Jan. 20 and Oct. 15, 2025 the most common country of origin is Mexico (832), followed by Guatemala (568) and Honduras (197).

Efforts to drive up the number of arrests have led to the targeting of people with no criminal history (and those convicted of a criminal offense may have been for a minor charge). Immigrants with no criminal convictions are increasingly the largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE.

And ICE arrests alone don’t even capture the full scope of the situation, as illustrated by a May 29 immigration raid in Harlan that was carried out by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) despite being unrelated to drugs.

ICE detention in Kentucky is growing and the total number of people in federal custody in the state’s local jails is at a historic high.

The total number of people detained by ICE was 68,990 on Jan. 8, 2026, up from 39,703 on Jan. 12, 2024, a 74% increase. Yet these staggering numbers only reflect around two-thirds of people detained for immigration reasons as they don’t include those facing criminal prosecution in the custody of U.S. Marshals or the Bureau of Prisons.

Local jails are playing a significant role in the Trump administration’s mass arrest and deportation agenda because in 25 states they are the only facilities available for holding people arrested by ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service. The federal government depends on local jails for detention space, and transfers people across the country to local jails that they pay a per diem. In Kentucky, the increasing use of local jails for immigration detention puts pressure on an already-strained system rife with crowding and other poor, dangerous conditions.

Kentucky’s local jails have a long history of renting jail beds to the federal government because federal per-diem amounts are typically much higher than what the state pays jails to incarcerate people in Kentucky Department of Corrections (DOC) custody. Laurel County and Grayson County even vastly expanded their local jails for the specific purpose of holding more people in federal custody for this reason.

Until recently, these jails primarily held people in the federal criminal system for the U.S. Marshal’s service rather than ICE; however, there is a lot of interplay between the two agencies that is important to understand for getting a full picture of immigration detention in jails. For a person arrested by ICE who is charged with a federal immigration crime, custody is transferred to the U.S. Marshals until the criminal case is resolved, at which time ICE can arrest them again (directly from jail or prison after their case is dismissed or they serve a sentence) and then they re-enter immigration detention.

Kentucky jail data shows a marked increase in the number of people in federal custody in Kentucky jails since the beginning of 2024 — jumping from 1,963 on Jan. 23, 2025 to a historic high of 2,827 on Dec. 24, 2025 — a 44% increase.

Note that the federal custody population number includes immigrants detained by ICE and by the U.S. Marshals for a federal immigration crime (and for 49% of people booked into U.S. Marshals custody in May of 2025, immigration offenses were the reason), as well as people in U.S. Marshals custody who are not immigrants and have federal criminal charges completely unrelated to immigration.

Although it isn’t possible to parse out exactly how many people in federal custody in Kentucky jails are being detained for immigration enforcement reasons, it’s clear the upward trend that started in February is related to the intensification of immigration enforcement happening around the same time.

ICE data analyzed by Relevant Research shows dramatic growth in the number of Kentucky jails contracting with ICE for beds and in the estimated average daily population of these detainees. In 2024, just one local facility in the state, the Boone County Detention Center, had a consistent and significant population of people in ICE custody. On Jan. 21, 2025 the estimated “interval average daily population” (ADP) of ICE detainees in Kentucky jails was 120.5. By Aug. 18, 2025, there were an estimated 915.0 people in ICE custody across nine local jails. In November two additional jails — Christian and Daviess County Detention Centers — started contracting with ICE, and on Dec. 26, 2025, the estimated ADP was up to 1,176.3 across 11 local jails, seven of which consistently hold a significant number of people in ICE custody.

The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority.
Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members.
ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.","“How sad that indigenous people have to prove they are not illegal immigrants,” wrote Cindy Smith in response to a Facebook posting by the Lac Courte Oreilles (LCO) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.

On Jan. 10, the LCO Tribal Governing Board issued an immediate release that it was “closely monitoring recent events that took place in Minneapolis, and around the country involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Agents.”

Just a few days before, on Wednesday, Jan. 7, a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, was shot and killed in her vehicle by an ICE agent in South Minneapolis.

Over 1,000 ICE agents were in the Twin Cities area as a major campaign that has received national attention to detain and arrest those who had reportedly violated federal immigration laws. The agents not only tracked down those without legal status to reside in the U.S., but also questioned and detained others because of their appearance, such as skin color and accent, whether or not they were legal residents or citizens. Caught up in the crackdown were at least five Native Americans who were detained, including four Oglala Sioux from South Dakota and one from the Red Lake reservation in Minnesota.

Jose Roberto “Beto” Ramirez, a Red Lake descendant, told a reporter for ICT that he was trailed by an SUV and when he parked in a grocery store parking lot, he was dragged out of his vehicle without explanation and detained for several hours. Ramirez said he felt like he had been “kidnapped”. He was subsequently released without any charges.

News reports from the Twin Cities have stated that Native Americans, who are fully U.S. citizens, had been approached by ICE agents regarding their immigration/citizenship status.

In response to Native Americans being stopped by ICE, several Wisconsin tribes issued statements voicing concern over the stops and also offering advice to their members.

“We humbly offer our sincere condolences to all those affected by these incidents,” reads the Lac Courte Oreilles release, which assured members that the Tribal Governing Board “is actively working to ensure our tribe and members are as safe as possible and is reviewing policies to implement access restrictions in areas that are non-public, employee-only, and restricted to ensure our facilities are entitled to every legal protection possible.

“In these unprecedented and uncertain times, it is essential that we remain vigilant and protect one another. We encourage everyone to stand together in solidarity to support each other spiritually, mentally, emotionally, and physically. The safety and well-being of all tribal members continues to be our highest priority. We will do everything in our power to protect our members, reservation, government buildings, and enterprises.”

Jon Greendeer, president of the Ho-Chunk Nation posted Wednesday, Jan. 14, “My office and social media feeds have been buzzing with concerned tribal members following the recent shooting of an American Citizen by an armed ICE official. Now with the news of alleged door-to-door campaigns, the threat literally hits home.”

Also on Jan. 14, the Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians posted the following: “The Tribe wants to be clear: we do not support or cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Our priority is the safety, dignity, and protection of our tribal members. We are deeply concerned by reports coming out of Minnesota involving the detention of tribal members, as well as ICE actively being reported in areas near our community. As indigenous people to this land, our identity should never be questioned, challenged, or used as a reason for detention.”

On Jan. 12, the St. Croix Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians issued a statement on “opposing ICE and affirming tribal sovereignty,” which said, in part, that tribal leaders “strongly oppose the actions and presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) including the targeting of community members, the detention and separation of families, and the ongoing disregard of human rights.”

On Jan. 10, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community alerted members on Facebook that Native Americans “are being caught up in raids and detained.”

Like several of the tribal posts, the Stockbridge-Munsee tribe encourages its members to be prepared for being “stopped, detained and questioned regarding your citizenship.”

Even though tribal members are U.S. citizens, Wisconsin tribal members are being encouraged to carry their tribal, state and federal IDs and even birth certificates.

On Jan. 14, the LCO tribe said it would be issuing ID cards for enrolled members who live off the reservation in the Twin Cities at the Minneapolis American Indian Center Rotunda, and like other tribes, LCO noted that fees are being waived for the ID cards.

On Jan. 11, the Oneida Nation offered detailed guidance if members encountered ICE agents:

“Stay calm and ask for identification.”

“Always carry your Oneida ID.”

“If detained, say ‘I want to speak with an attorney.’”

“Report encounters to Oneida Police Department.”

“At home, keep the door closed and request a judicial warrant.”

Several tribes are notifying members that if the ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by a judge, the agents do not have permission to enter their home without consent.

ICE agents have been observed approaching homes and businesses with administrative warrants issued by ICE, which lack the legal weight of a judicial warrant.

Some of the tribes are advising members if ICE comes to their doors without a judicial warrant to not only not open their doors, but also report the presence of the ICE agents to tribal police.

The Ho-Chunk Nation said it will provide its members with door signs for law enforcement that “alert” officers of the “state, tribal and federal citizenship” status of the residents and communicate that “agents may not enter the property without a valid warrant.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/230714-Wisconsin-Examiner-Staff-43-2048x717.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:01:19.170704

Under the old district lines, Trump won Kaptur’s district by 7 percentage points, according to NBC News’ Decision Desk.","Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan on Thursday resigned her post and launched a campaign for Congress in Ohio, jumping into a crowded Republican primary for a seat that became more GOP-friendly after a recent redistricting push.

In a video announcing her campaign launch, Sheahan highlighted her time at ICE and slammed Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, the Ohio congresswoman whom she’s aiming to unseat.

“In less than one year at ICE, I’ve stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,” Sheahan said in the video. “In Congress, hypocrisy, excuses and failure can earn you a lifetime job, but on my family farm that would put us out of business.”

“Ohio neighborhoods are safer, thanks to President [Donald] Trump and ICE,” Sheahan added later in her video.

Her campaign launch brings the number of Republicans running in the district’s primary — which is slated to take place on May 5 — to more than half a dozen.

The GOP primary field includes state Rep. Josh Williams and Derek Merrin, a former state lawmaker who was the GOP nominee against Kaptur in 2024.

A Kaptur campaign spokesperson said in a statement, “While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents. She’s working to lower costs for working families, protect access to affordable health care, and bring transformative investments to Northwest Ohio.”

House Republicans are heading into the election year with a slim majority, compounded by dozens of retirements on both sides of the aisle. Trump has expressed concern in recent days that the GOP could lose control of the House.

“It’s some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” Trump told Reuters on Wednesday. Earlier this month, the president told House Republicans in a speech that Democrats would seek to impeach him if they flip control of the chamber.

Ohio’s 9th District is one that Republicans have targeted for several cycles and has consistently been a battleground district.

In 2024, Kaptur beat Merrin in the general election by less than a percentage point while Trump carried the district by a wider margin. The congresswoman is one of a handful of Democrats currently serving in a district that the president won in 2024.

During a wave of partisan redistricting across the country last year, Republicans in Ohio redrew the 9th District’s boundaries to make the seat more favorable for the GOP. Under the old district lines, Trump won Kaptur’s district by 7 percentage points, according to NBC News’ Decision Desk. But under the new district lines, Trump would have won the seat by 11 percentage points.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race in this year’s midterm elections a “Toss Up.”

In 2024, Trump endorsed Merrin ahead of the GOP primary in this district, helping propel him to victory in a small but competitive primary field. The president has not yet endorsed in this district ahead of this year’s primary election.

In her launch video and her resignation letter Thursday, Sheahan highlighted her work with the Trump administration and her ties to the president.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260115-madison-sheahan-mn-1045-602aa5.jpg",N,,2026-01-16 11:59:18.356411

After nearly three decades in Minnesota, Cecilia Sosa’s parents started a cleaning business together in the last few years and had “flourished”, making connections and friends, she said.
“I am not ready for them to leave,” Cecilia Sosa said.
Each time she hears or sees cars that may belong to immigration agents, she rushes outside to check who they’re after.
“I basically tell everyone here: ‘I couldn’t save my husband, but I could probably save you,’” she said.","Paulo Sosa Garcia and Ramona Cecilia Silva were heading to work in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota, on Monday morning when federal immigration agents pulled them over and arrested them. By the next morning, they were detained in El Paso, Texas.

Tomas Martinez Gregorio was driving his wife, Daisy Martinez, and their six-year-old son, Jayren, to a hospital in Brooklyn Park when federal agents pulled them over and took Gregorio. Jayren never made it to his tonsillectomy appointment.

About 3,000 federal agents are either operating in Minnesota or on their way to the region – seeking to arrest immigrants in what the Trump administration said was its largest enforcement operation thus far. More than 2,400 people in Minnesota have been arrested in recent weeks – and many have been swiftly moved to detention centers out of state, or removed from the country.

Some had valid visas and a right to be in the US, according to local leaders who have been responding to constituents affected by the raids and lawyers representing immigrants. The Guardian has confirmed that several refugees with legal status have been arrested in recent days after the Trump administration said it would “re-examine thousands of refugee cases”.

Many have been arrested in their neighborhoods – at home, on their way to work, at department stores and restaurants, outside schools and places of worship.

Their families are grappling with the aftermath.

“I just want for my parents to come back home,” said Cecilia Sosa, the eldest of Sosa Garcia and Silva’s three daughters.

Sosa Garcia and Silva came to the US from Mexico in 1999, and had been in a years-long process to obtain legal residency, according to their daughter. Five days before they were detained, they had been told that their case had been approved to move forward. Now their daughters are instead working to raise funds for lawyers’ fees to get them released from detention – posting a video on TikTok saying they are “living their worst nightmare”, which includes footage of their parents’ car on the side of the road with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicles around it.

After nearly three decades in Minnesota, Cecilia Sosa’s parents started a cleaning business together in the last few years and had “flourished”, making connections and friends, she said. Their youngest daughter is 19, and they helped her with college expenses, and were caregivers for Cecilia Sosa’s grandfather, who just had a brain tumor removed.

Now the daughters have had minimal contact with their parents since 12 January. Sosa Garcia was able to call his daughters’ aunt to inform the family that he and his wife were detained. Silva sent a text message to one of her daughters telling her that she was detained and asked the family to call a lawyer. The couple are now being held separately at Camp East Montana at Fort Bliss, a massive tent facility in El Paso where human rights groups have alleged that detainees face physical abuse and unsafe conditions.

“I am not ready for them to leave,” Cecilia Sosa said. Her nine-year old son, whom her parents were helping her raise, asks frequently about them, she said: “We need them here.”

Daisy Martinez, whose husband, Tomas Martinez Gregorio, was detained on New Year’s Eve, said she has also struggled to explain to her son what happened to his stepfather. “He says every single day: ‘Can we get Tommy back?’ He tells his teacher: ‘Can you please save Tommy?’” she said.

The other night, her son told her he’d dreamed that his stepfather was back – and he was sad to wake up. “It just breaks my heart to hear a six-year-old say that they don’t want to wake up,” Martinez said.

Martinez and Gregorio had been married recently, in November. He is undocumented, from Mexico. Although Martinez is a US citizen, the couple had decided not to apply to adjust Gregorio’s immigration status during the Trump administration because they worried that an application would draw attention to him, and ICE would try to target him for deportation.

As more and more federal immigration agents deployed to the Twin Cities in December, Martinez had worried about Gregorio. Still, they hadn’t expected three cars with ICE agents to corner their vehicle as they were driving to the hospital.

Martinez tried to talk them down – but the agents, who were armed, demanded that Gregorio get out of the car. Video footage that Martinez recorded, reviewed by the Guardian, captured her pleading with them to let Gregorio go, and an agent telling her that her husband had a DUI on his record.

Later, an immigration agent told her that her husband did not in fact have a criminal record – and Daisy said she hasn’t been given a reason for why exactly her family was targeted.

When Martinez tried to chase after her husband, who was being ushered into an agent’s car, several other agents tackled her against the car and pinned her arms behind her, she said.

“And then they left,” she said.

Martinez then noticed her son shaking and screaming in the back seat. She briefly blacked out. When she came to, she called her cousin.

“We were two minutes away from the hospital,” she said. “We never made it to the surgery.”

Panicked, Martinez and her cousin tried to find Gregorio by tracking the location-sharing feature on his phone and realized he had been taken – like many immigrants arrested in the region – to the ICE facility at Fort Snelling, a former military fortification in south Minnesota. After that, he was transferred to a county jail in Sherburne county, a 40-minute drive from the couple’s home.

In the weeks since, she has been scrambling to figure out how to get her husband released – and how to parent and survive without him. He worked in the insulation industry and had made a good salary, allowing Martinez to work part-time and focus on childcare, she said.

Ever since agents tackled her, she said, an old injury on her foot has been acting up, making it difficult for her to walk or stand for long periods. That, combined with insomnia and the trauma of Gregorio’s arrest, has made it difficult for her to do her job as a part-time supervisor for a fast-food chain.

“I’m the child of an immigrant, I’m the wife of an immigrant,” she said. “My son was born in Mexico … so I’m basically the mom of an immigrant,” she said. “And [ICE] made me feel like my citizenship doesn’t matter any more. My social status doesn’t mean anything, my passport doesn’t mean anything.”

Still, she said, she tries to watch out for her friends and neighbors without citizenship. In the past few weeks, she has been making regular runs to the gas station to fill up their cars, making grocery runs for whoever needs it. Each time she hears or sees cars that may belong to immigration agents, she rushes outside to check who they’re after.

Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who illegally entered the U.S. from Venezuela in August 2022, was the target of the ICE operation when he was shot in the leg, according to DHS. He was previously convicted of driving without a license and arrested on two counts of giving a false name to a peace officer.

Officials said he was released by Minnesota authorities before ICE could lodge a detainer against him.

Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma were identified as the two men who came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the ICE agent with a snow shovel and broom handle while he was trying to arrest Sosa-Celis, according to DHS.

Before the attack, the federal agent was in the process of arresting Sosa-Celis during a routine traffic stop when the illegal immigrant crashed his vehicle into another car and fled.

The private polling suggested a rupturing of the coalition of independent, moderate and minority voters who were key parts of Trump's victory in 2024. Such voters will play a big role in determining whether Republicans keep their slim House majority in November's midterms.

If Republicans lose the House, Trump will head into his final two years in office as a lame duck who, he acknowledges, could face a third impeachment.

Zoom in: To the degree they support a more constrained approach, some advisers are playing to the president's occasional misgivings about the optics of some ICE tactics.

""I wouldn't say he's concerned about the policy,"" a top Trump adviser told Axios. ""He wants deportations. He wants mass deportations. What he doesn't want is what people are seeing. He doesn't like the way it looks. It looks bad, so he's expressed some discomfort at that.""

""... [T]here's the right way to do this. And this doesn't look like the right way to a lot of people.""

Several Republicans in Congress have expressed concern to the White House about how the raids are playing out, according to a person familiar with the discussions.

ICE's aggressive tactics are dominating the news and obscuring the White House's work on cost-of-living issues that congressional Republicans, Trump and his team see as more important.

By the numbers: The internal GOP polling that alarmed some Trump insiders was completed at the end of December, days before an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis.

60% of independent voters and 58% of undecided voters said Trump was ""too focused"" on deporting illegal immigrants, the poll viewed by Trump's team found.

33% said Trump was primarily deporting law-abiding people, as opposed to criminals.

ICE is taking a reputational hit. Two public surveys released this week — one from CNN, another from YouGov — found that most Americans said the agency was making U.S. cities less safe.

Another poll done for the Associated Press after Good's death found that just 38% of Americans now approve of Trump's immigration policies.

The big picture: ICE's tactics are drawing pushback from some prominent Trump supporters. Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump on the eve of the 2024 election, complained on his show this week about ""militarized groups of people roaming the streets, just showing up with masks on, snatching people up.""

""Are we really going to be the Gestapo?"" he asked. ""'Where's your papers?' Is that what we've come to?""

Friction point: In its push to fulfill Trump's promise of mass deportations, ICE is not getting help from police in ""sanctuary cities"" such as Minneapolis and St. Paul, which ban local authorities from engaging in immigration enforcement.

State and local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz (D), have encouraged peaceful protests.

""You're only seeing chaotic ICE raids in blue sanctuary cities where local officials are fighting against federal law enforcement,"" Vice President Vance said Tuesday on X.

Reality check: Publicly, Trump and the White House continue to back an aggressive immigration approach.

In a Truth Social post Thursday, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, which, among other things, could lead to him sending in National Guard troops.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are architects of the current effort, and they have Trump's support.

Some Trump allies believe Noem, a former South Dakota governor, is preparing to run for president in 2028 as an immigration hardliner.

After the federal government took an axe to San Francisco Immigration Court in 2025, cutting its bench from 21 judges to four in a matter of months, it’s starting the new year by making that shrinkage permanent. Last week, the Department of Justice told court staff (opens in new tab) it will not renew its lease for offices and courtrooms at 100 Montgomery St. by the end of this year. The announcement was first reported by Mission Local.

The Montgomery Street facility housed 19 of the 21 judges at the start of 2025. Without it, San Francisco Immigration Court will run entirely out of its much smaller space at 630 Sansome St., where Immigration and Customs Enforcement also has offices. ICE officers routinely detain asylum seekers in the halls outside Sansome courtrooms, shuttle them a few feet down a hallway, and disappear them into a holding area. It’s a far quicker and more secretive process than the dozens of ICE detentions at the Montgomery building, which happened in public view on the street out front, leading to some of the past year’s most memorable confrontations between protesters and ICE.

In its internal announcement, the DOJ said all staff at Montgomery Street will be relocated to Concord Immigration Court this year. Several immigration law experts say that if cases are reassigned out of San Francisco, asylum seekers could be robbed of the unique bevy of services the city’s legal aid community provides.

“We‘ve been proud of ourselves as sort of like a model for the rest of the country for how to do large-scale, public-defender-style immigrant defense,” said Jordan Weiner, interim executive director at La Raza Centro Legal. “By shutting down SF immigration court, they’re doing a good job of making it harder for us.”

La Raza Centro Legal is part of the San Francisco Immigrant Legal Defense Collaborative, a group of 16 nonprofit organizations that provide legal support to people facing deportation. The collaborative ended 2025 with a flawless record in helping people detained by ICE at immigration court, winning 100% of habeas corpus cases filed in federal court to get those people released.

The city funds the coalition’s work and requires that nearly all of it take place in San Francisco. It’s unclear if San Francisco will pay for legal services at the Concord court, 25 miles away.

Concord’s court saw six of its 13 judges fired in 2025 and has a backlog of 6,000 cases.

“The judges in that court will now have to deal with a barrage of new cases on top of their already crushing caseloads,” said Shuting Chen, who was fired as anSF immigration judge in December.

What’s next

The culling of immigration judges has been one of the Trump administration’s most successful efforts to remake the federal judiciary to serve his policy objectives. In 2025, more than 125 immigration judges across the U.S. were terminated or accepted buyouts to retire early, shrinking the national judge corps by at least 15%. Courts in blue cities have fared far worse than average. In September, news leaked that the Trump administration planned to backfill the vacancies with 600 military judges. At least one of those military judges has already been fired (opens in new tab) for apparently granting asylum too frequently. In early December, the DOJ posted job openings for “deportation judges.”

The closure of Montgomery Street dashes hopes that any of the newly appointed or hired judges will restock the bench in San Francisco, which had one of the busiest immigration courts in the country.

“The court at Montgomery is an institution and, for many immigrants, the first real contact they have with the justice system in our country,” said Chen. “Its demise is an intangible loss … because the court is a symbol of the rule of law and judicial integrity and independence we’re supposed to have in this country.”

As of September, San Francisco Immigration Court had the nation’s 10th-largest backlog: 120,000 cases. For the thousands of asylum seekers whose judges have been fired, the most that they can do is refresh the DOJ website to see if their cases have been reassigned and when they might get a day in court. Many have received notice that their hearing dates have been pushed to 2029.

“There‘s a reason the Trump administration is trying to shut down the courts,” Weiner said. “Because that’s where you vindicate your rights.”

According to the DOJ’s memo, the Montgomery courts could be vacated as early as this summer, but it’s unclear when or where cases may be reassigned.

Weiner doesn’t think that will matter much in the end. “ I don’t think the administration has any plans for these cases ever to be heard,” Weiner said. “I think they’re going to keep finding ways to cut them off before they get to the final hearing.”",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_2pkhrvtcil08debgtat2vea610/-S1200x630-FPNG,N,,2026-01-16 12:00:07.215609

The changes, expected to come into force 1 March, have prompted widespread questions from readers about how the law could affect them.

The Compass spoke with HSM partner and immigration expert Alastair David to analyse some of the key nuances in the law.

We also consulted Daniel Altneu, a partner at Bedell Cristin, as well as Immigration Minister Michael Myles and Chief Officer Wesley Howell, to help break down what the law might mean for readers and their families.

The key changes and who is most impacted

One of the central changes in the bill is a significantly longer timeline before a person becomes eligible to apply for Caymanian status – 20 years for most people and 15 years for those married to a Caymanian.

Caymanian status brings with it the right to vote, the right to own businesses, and freedom from annual work-permit fees, which, in some professions, can run into tens of thousands of dollars a year. As a result, the changes carry a substantial financial and practical impact for people aspiring to status, as well as for their employers.

Other groups that are likely to feel the impact most quickly include new work-permit holders, who will not be able to change employers during the first two years of employment, and married couples, who face tighter rules around term limits and residency.

Who is covered by the old system?

Currently, the Caymanian Protection Act, while passed, is not scheduled to come into force until 1 March.

The bill includes transitional provisions. Anyone who already holds permanent residence will remain under the old system, meaning they will still become eligible to apply for Caymanian status after 15 years of residency.

“Under the earlier version of the bill, many more people would have been grandfathered in,” said David.

“Under the amended version, that protection largely applies only to people who already hold permanent residence.”

There is greater uncertainty for people who have applied for permanent residence but are still waiting for a decision on their application. If they do not get approval by the time the legislation comes into force, they will likely fall under the new provisions of the law, David believes.

“From what I can see, they will fall under the new system,” David said, noting that the law appears to treat the grant of permanent residency and the commencement date of the legislation, not the application date, as the cut-off point.

In an update published by HSM in a newsletter to clients, the firm wrote, “This amendment will adversely affect at least 600 people who are currently working pursuant to a Permission to Continue Working with pending PR applications if decisions are not given before the CPA comes into effect.”

For work-permit holders, the new job-change restrictions will apply once the act comes into force, so that provision largely impacts new arrivals to Cayman. Ultimately, the regulations will determine what exceptions apply.

Changes from the draft law

Changes to the transitional provisions in the draft act, which were approved by Parliament, have raised created uncertainty to who exactly would be ‘grandfathered’ in with respect to when they could apply for Caymanian status.

The initial draft of the law grandfathered in anyone who has a ‘certificate, permission or exemption’ – which lawyers say could have been interpreted quite broadly. The amended act passed by Parliament much more specifically references anyone who has been ‘granted the right to reside permanently’ in the Cayman Islands.

The finalised act creates a cut-off for the transitional provision to anyone who has legal permanent residence granted at the time the legislation is passed, in the view of two senior local attorneys who analysed the Act.

In simple terms, they say, if someone has a permanent-residence application in motion, that application will be treated under the old law, but a subsequent status application will fall under the new law.

Altneu, a partner at Bedell Cristin law firm, said this was an “unexpected shift” from the draft bill that would primarily impact those waiting for a decision under the permanent residence points system.

“The bill specified that these individuals would be fully grandfathered into the pre-existing pathways to the right to be Caymanian,” he said.

“Even if their applications were granted after commencement of the Caymanian Protection Act, they would have retained their eligibility to apply for the right to be Caymanian on grounds of naturalisation after at least 15 years’ legal and ordinary residence in the islands or at least five years after the receipt of their Certificate of Naturalisation or Registration. However, the act has removed that transitional protection.”

He added, “With pending Permanent Residency Points System applicants currently being scheduled for History and Culture Tests in May 2026, this change could have a meaningful impact on many individuals and families who had previously been reassured by the transitional provisions.”

Chief Officer Wesley Howell said anyone who applied before the act comes into force should still be under the old timelines – even for a future Cayman status application.

He said the transitional provisions were intended to prevent anyone from being disadvantaged.

“We’ve not sought to move the goalpost for anybody that has a legitimate expectation,” he said.

However, both lawyers say that is not what the law currently says, and if that is the intent they believe an amendment would be needed. The sought clarity could also perhaps be addressed by the forthcoming regulations.

A misconception about human rights laws

There is a common misconception that UK or international human-rights laws requires Cayman to offer citizenship after a fixed period of residence. According to David, that is not the case.

“There is no European or UK requirement that Cayman must grant citizenship after a certain period,” he said.

“Extending the timeline from 15 to 20 years is within the government’s margin of appreciation, and is likely to be lawful.”

He noted that the UK itself is currently debating extending its own timelines for long-term residency and citizenship.

Harkening back to the introduction of term limits, Howell said there is an EU provision that covers certain rights, acquired over continuous legal residency, but how that would be interpreted is unclear.

“How long is that piece of string? We don’t know,” he said. “We believe that it’s less than 10 years – that is the whole reason why term limits were introduced in the first place, because there was significant pressure in relation to the persons who had been the islands for decades without having any sort of long-term residency.”

How the changes affect married couples

For a relatively small but significant group of people, one technical change could have a major impact.

Under the existing system, married work-permit holders can benefit from whichever spouse has the longer remaining term limit. The new law reverses that position.

“This is the section that surprised me the most,” David said.

“The changes are punitive for married couples. Where spouses previously benefited from the longer remaining term limit, the new law ties both spouses to the shorter one.”

For example, a worker who might otherwise expect to remain eligible for work permits for nine years could find themselves limited to just three years if they marry a spouse who has already spent longer on the island. The spouse could still rollover or apply for permanent residence, but these are not always viable options for families.

Howell said the aim here is to prevent people racking up years of residency by default or “strategically extended their time limits by entering into marriages or civil partnerships”.

Another significant change removes provisions that previously allowed dependents of permanent residents to remain in Cayman after the death of their spouse.

“The consequence of that could be devastating,” David warned.

For instance, a stay-at-home parent and children could face legal uncertainty – or even removal – following the sudden death of the family’s main permit holder.

“The biggest potential legal challenges relate to marriage provisions and dependent rights,” he said.

The impact on spouses of Caymanians

Spouses of Caymanians will also face longer timelines.

The waiting period to apply for permanent residence increases from one year of marriage to seven years.

They will also be required to submit annual declarations to Workforce Opportunities and Residency Cayman (WORC) during that period.

The impact on people with children

There is one significant change for expatriate families. The minimum salary requirement to have a ‘dependent’ added to a work permit has increased significantly.

A minimum monthly income of $5,000 (up from $3,500) is required to include a single dependent on a work permit. Another $1,000 per month (up from $500) is required for each additional dependent.

So, a family of four, where only one parent works, would require a salary of $7,000 a month – $84,000 per year – to relocate to Cayman, compared with $4,500 a month or $54,000 annually under the previous legislation. A single mother-of-one would now need to earn at least $60,000 annually to bring her child to Cayman.

The thresholds apply for new permits, and there is potential impact for firms trying to attract talent from overseas, especially as a job or work-permit offer would clearly not include work or income for a spouse.

Where it gets complicated for people already in Cayman is on work-permit renewals. Immigration lawyers say they simply don’t know how these would be treated. But the potential scenario arises for people who have worked in Cayman for a number of years and are settled with families, that they may no longer meet the minimum salary requirements to have dependents stay with them when they apply for a new or renewed permit.

The Compass has sought clarity from government on this and are awaiting a response.

The job-hopping ban

The bill introduces a prohibition on work-permit holders changing employers during their first two years in Cayman.

The stated aim is to prevent job-hopping and clamp down on labour-brokerage schemes involving permits for jobs that do not exist.

There is a carve-out allowing workers to change jobs where they can satisfy WORC that there were “prescribed circumstances” leading to the termination of their employment, though those circumstances have not yet been set out in regulations.

“The restriction is not a complete ban,” David said.

“Its legality and fairness will depend on the exceptions written into regulations. If abused workers cannot change jobs, that would create serious problems.”

This will impact new permit holders only, so it doesn’t apply to someone who had a permit issued before the new legislation commences.

ID cards for work-permit holders

The law introduces a new fee for work-permit ID cards, though few details have been published about how the system will operate.

David raised concerns about enforcement.

“As drafted, officials could demand to see a work-permit ID card without reasonable suspicion of a crime being committed,” he said.

“From a civil liberties perspective, that is concerning.”

How the law helps Caymanians

The legislation is explicitly designed to prioritise Caymanians in the labour market. One of the main mechanisms for doing so is economic pressure.

“It will become more expensive to employ expatriates,” David said.

“That may encourage hiring Caymanians, but it will also affect industries where Caymanians are not available.”

Ultimately, he said, the success of the reforms will depend on how they are implemented.

“If, in five years’ time, Caymanians are progressing further and doing better, then that will be good for the country,” he said.

“But that outcome depends on how the law is applied.”

Myles believes it will not be meaningfully more expensive to hire from overseas. When Caymanians are not available, he says, work permits will be granted. As of now, the application fees have been subject to a small increase, but work-permit fees have not gone up.

He agrees that success is also about implementation in tandem with other reforms to improve training and education, and align scholarships with a workforce development plan.",https://caymancompass.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Immigration-reform-1920x1280-1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 09:59:10.703029

While the panel of judges did not rule on the merits of the case, it did state that a judge in New Jersey does not have jurisdiction over it.

Federal laws require Khalil to challenge his case in immigration court first, the judges said in a 2-1 ruling. Then, he can appeal.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two. But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct,” judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas said in their ruling. “Because Khalil raises legal questions that a PFR (petition for review) court can meaningfully review later on, the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act) bars him from attacking his detention and removal in a habeas petition.”

Judge Arianna Freeman dissented, writing that “Khalil’s case requires us to tease these strands apart,” and that it can be decided by the district court.

“Khalil says his claims are now-or-never ones because his injuries are ongoing and his rights are ‘being violated, now,’” Freeman wrote. “But his claims raise legal questions challenging the government’s very basis for trying to remove (and thus detaining) him.”

Khalil, in a statement, said the ruling is “deeply disappointing, but it does not break our resolve.”

“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability,” he wrote. “I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called the ruling a “vindication of the rule of law and the simple truth that DHS has argued from the beginning: an immigration judge, not a district judge, has the authority to decide if Mr. Khalil should have been released.”

She maintained that the Trump administration “acted well within its statutory and constitutional authority to detain Khalil” and said “DHS will work to enforce his lawful removal order.”

The American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey said the Trump administration cannot re-detain Khalil until the order officially takes effect, which will not happen while he can still appeal. This can mean having the case reviewed by all judges on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, or even the U.S. Supreme Court.

“The Trump administration violated the Constitution by targeting Mahmoud Khalil, detaining him thousands of miles from home, and retaliating against him for his speech,” Bobby Hodgson, deputy legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said. “Dissent is not grounds for detention or deportation, and we will continue to pursue all legal options to ensure Mahmoud’s rights are vindicated.”

Khalil’s cases

Immigration officials arrested Khalil, a legal resident in the U.S., last March at his apartment in Manhattan. Khalil participated in pro-Palestinian protests and campus encampments at Columbia in 2024.

The Trump administration accused the 30-year-old of being a “pro-Hamas sympathizer,” without providing evidence to support the claim.

In a two-page memo obtained by The Associated Press, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Khalil could be expelled because of his beliefs, and accused him of antisemitic conduct and participating in disruptive protests. Khalil has denied these allegations of antisemitism, saying that he was criticizing Israel and the United States over what is happening in Gaza, and that the federal government is trying to suppress this speech.

After being detained for more than 100 days, Khalil was released in June when U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz ruled that it was likely that Rubio’s attempted deportation on foreign policy grounds would be ruled unconstitutional. In a separate order, Farbiarz declared that Khalil was neither a danger nor a flight risk.

Department of Homeland Security officials also alleged Khalil failed to disclose information on his green card application.

In September, a U.S. immigration judge denied Khalil’s motion for a waiver preventing his removal from the U.S. and ordered that he be deported to either Algeria or his native Syria.

Prosecutors have yet to charge Khalil with a crime in either case.

Deportations challenged in court

Four other student activists, Rumeysa Ozturk, Mohsen Mahdawi, Badar Khan Suri and Yunseo Chung, were similarly accused by the Trump administration of being a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.

The New York Times reported that these students challenged their own deportations or detainments in separate, individual lawsuits. Those who were detained, the outlet wrote, were later ordered to be released.

Massachusetts Federal District Judge William G. Young ruled in September that the Trump administration chilled these students’ speech with arrests he said were aimed at striking fear to those critical of Israel.",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25294548168147_AP_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:00:11.683150

Gen. Pam Bondi said in September that “clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” and that the Justice Department was going to ensure that they exist nationwide.
This effort goes far beyond what Congress intended when it passed the underlying legislation,” Carter wrote.","A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit demanding California turn over its voter rolls, calling the request “unprecedented and illegal” and accusing the federal government of trying to “abridge the right of many Americans to cast their ballots.”

U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, a Clinton appointee based in Santa Ana, questioned the Justice Department’s motivations and called its lawsuit demanding voter data from California Secretary of State Shirley Weber not just an overreach into state-run elections, but a threat to American democracy.

“The centralization of this information by the federal government would have a chilling effect on voter registration which would inevitably lead to decreasing voter turnout as voters fear that their information is being used for some inappropriate or unlawful purpose,” Carter wrote. “This risk threatens the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy.”

Carter wrote that the “taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece by piece until there is nothing left,” and that the Justice Department’s lawsuit was “one of these cuts that imperils all Americans.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

In a video she posted to the social media platform X earlier Thursday, Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon — who heads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division — said she was proud of her office’s efforts to “clean up the voter rolls nationally,” including by suing states for their data.

“We are going to touch every single state and finish this project,” she said.

Weber, who is California’s top elections official, said in a written statement that she is “entrusted with ensuring that California’s state election laws are enforced — including state laws that protect the privacy of California’s data.”

“I will continue to uphold my promise to Californians to protect our democracy, and I will continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote,” Weber said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office called the decision another example of “Trump and his administration losing to California” — one day after another court upheld California’s congressional redistricting plan under Proposition 50, which the Trump administration also challenged in court after state voters passed it overwhelmingly in November.

The Justice Department sued Weber in September after she refused to hand over detailed voter information for some 23 million Californians, alleging that she was unlawfully preventing federal authorities from ensuring state compliance with federal voting regulations and safeguarding federal elections against fraud.

It separately sued Weber’s counterparts in various other states who also declined the department’s requests for their states’ voter rolls.

The lawsuit followed an executive order by President Trump in March that purported to require voters to provide proof of citizenship and ordered states to disregard mail ballots not received by election day. It also followed years of allegations by Trump, made without evidence, that voting in California has been hampered by widespread fraud and voting by noncitizens — part of his broader and equally unsupported claim that the 2020 presidental election was stolen from him.

In announcing the lawsuit, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi said in September that “clean voter rolls are the foundation of free and fair elections,” and that the Justice Department was going to ensure that they exist nationwide.

Weber denounced the lawsuit at the time as a “fishing expedition and pretext for partisan policy objectives,” and as “an unprecedented intrusion unsupported by law or any previous practice or policy of the U.S. Department of Justice.”

The Justice Department demanded a “current electronic copy of California’s computerized statewide voter registration list”; lists of “all duplicate registration records in Imperial, Los Angeles, Napa, Nevada, San Bernardino, Siskiyou, and Stanislaus counties”; a “list of all duplicate registrants who were removed from the statewide voter registration list”; and the dates of their removals.

It also demanded a list of all registrations that had been canceled due to voter deaths; an explanation for a recent decline in the recorded number of “inactive” voters in California; and a list of “all registrations, including date of birth, driver’s license number, and last four digits of Social Security Number, that were canceled due to non-citizenship of the registrant.”

Carter, in his ruling Thursday, took particular issue with the Justice Department’s reliance on federal civil rights laws to make its case.

“The Department of Justice seeks to use civil rights legislation which was enacted for an entirely different purpose to amass and retain an unprecedented amount of confidential voter data. This effort goes far beyond what Congress intended when it passed the underlying legislation,” Carter wrote.

Reuters reporting highlights the case of Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a Sierra Leonean national, who was deported to Ghana in November and detained before being sent back to her home country, illustrating the human and legal complexities of these removals.

Kuyateh’s Case

Kuyateh, 58, had fled Sierra Leone during the 1991–2002 civil war and lived in the United States for nearly 30 years. After being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in July, she applied for protection against deportation, citing fears of torture linked to her father’s political opposition. Although an immigration judge granted her request, she was deported to Ghana in November, where she was held at a hotel for six days before being forcibly sent to Sierra Leone. Video footage of her being dragged to a van went viral, sparking international attention.

Third-Country Deportation Program

Kuyateh was one of more than 30 U.S. deportees sent to Ghana last year under agreements with West African countries. Of those, at least 22 were subsequently repatriated to their home countries despite protections granted in the U.S., according to legal filings and interviews with lawyers representing the migrants. Equatorial Guinea also returned at least three U.S. deportees, many of whom were at risk of persecution, torture, or human rights violations in their countries of origin.

Human rights advocates argue that this practice violates international law prohibiting refoulement, which forbids sending individuals to countries where they face serious harm. Critics contend that third countries are being used to circumvent U.S. and international protections.

U.S. and West African Government Positions

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defended the removals, stating that all deportees were “illegal aliens” who had received due process. However, DHS did not address the subsequent repatriations, leaving questions about accountability. Ghana’s government said it only accepts migrants without criminal records and maintains that its actions are grounded in humanitarian principles, though some officials acknowledged that discussions with U.S. authorities included possible concessions related to visas and tariffs. Equatorial Guinea and the countries of origin largely did not respond to requests for comment.

Legal and Humanitarian Concerns

Lawyers and advocates say many deportees had valid protection claims. Some were targeted due to political beliefs, sexual orientation, or gender-based persecution. Video evidence and eyewitness accounts suggest that many were given no opportunity to contest their forced repatriation. U.S. courts have upheld the administration’s authority to deport individuals to third countries while legal challenges proceed, creating concerns over compliance with international human rights norms.

Impact on Migrants

The personal toll on deportees is significant. Kuyateh described being separated from her family in the United States and struggling to rebuild her life after being forcibly returned to Sierra Leone. Another migrant, Diadie Camara from Mauritania, described fear for his safety and the need to go into hiding after being repatriated via Equatorial Guinea and Morocco. Advocates emphasize the psychological and social hardships caused by the deportations, particularly for vulnerable populations with histories of conflict, slavery, or persecution.

Analysis

The use of third-country deportations highlights the tension between domestic immigration enforcement and international human rights obligations. From a realist perspective, the U.S. seeks to expedite removal of unauthorized migrants while minimizing direct responsibility for potential harm. However, this strategy risks undermining legal norms and creating diplomatic friction with host countries. For Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, participation may strengthen ties with the U.S. but exposes them to criticism for facilitating refoulement. The cases illustrate a broader ethical and legal dilemma: managing immigration pressures without violating international law or endangering vulnerable populations.

Home Depot faces criticism for ICE raids in store parking lots

Flock Safety's data used in immigration enforcement investigations

NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A group of Home Depot (HD.N), opens new tab investors is asking the company to review its partnership with surveillance firm Flock Safety and state how its data is used and shared with law enforcement, following reports by an independent media outlet that the vendor's data has been used in Immigration and Customs Enforcement investigations.

Home Depot locations have become hotbeds for ICE arrests, after U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller said the agency should target the home improvement chain, where migrant day laborers are known to gather.

Investors in several companies are increasingly seeking answers to how U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies and enforcement are affecting company operations and reputation.

Zevin Asset Management, a sustainability-minded investor that owns more than $7 million in Home Depot stock, is leading a shareholder proposal with 17 co-filers asking Home Depot to evaluate and report the risks associated with sharing data with third-party surveillance vendors.

Zevin's proposal comes after a Walmart (WMT.O), opens new tab and Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab shareholder asked the retailers for details on how the immigration crackdown is affecting their finances and supply chains, and as protests erupt after the fatal shooting of a 37-year-old woman by a U.S. Immigration agent in Minneapolis.

The investor group wants an ""assessment of privacy and civil rights risks, including discrimination or wrongful detention from misuse of customer data,"" according to the proposal seen by Reuters.

""Such practices may expose the Company to financial and legal risks, including potential data breaches and enforcement of evolving state privacy laws,"" shareholders said in the proposal. ""The Company already faces reputational risks stemming from frequent immigration enforcement raids occurring near its stores and heightened public concerns regarding data privacy.""

The company's annual shareholder meeting is expected in May.

Home Depot has faced criticism for ICE raids in its store parking lots, where immigrant day laborers often congregate looking for opportunities to work on construction projects. Some critics have said the company should speak out against the raids, which have prompted protests at some of its stores.

A Home Depot spokesperson said: ""We cannot legally interfere with federal enforcement agencies, including preventing them from coming into our stores and parking lots.""

Like other retailers, Home Depot collects demographic information including age, race, ethnicity and gender from companies that provide services on its behalf for fraud prevention, security and asset protection, according to its website.

The company discloses the information to ""law enforcement, public and government authorities"" that it considers ""reasonably necessary to comply with law, support investigations, and protect the rights and property.""

Home Depot also uses Flock Safety automated license-plate camera readers in its parking lots and in stores. The company does not grant access to its license-plate readers to federal law enforcement, the company spokesperson said. A report by digital publication 404 Media said ICE agents have used Flock Safety's data for immigration enforcement investigations after being sent the data by local law enforcement. Flock Safety does not have contracts with the Department of Homeland Security or its subagencies, including ICE, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The sharing of Flock Safety data by local police departments with ICE creates ""de facto federal surveillance without transparency or consent,"" the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, of which Zevin is a member, said in a letter to Home Depot's board of directors seen by Reuters.

The home improvement chain, which is not notified ahead of ICE enforcement, has advised employees to report immigration raids to the company, according to the spokesperson. The raids are recorded in a centralized database. Home Depot gives employees the option to go home, with pay, when these events occur.

Most of the resolutions, including the one at Home Depot, are nonbinding. A change by U.S. securities regulators could mean fewer such resolutions make it to corporate ballots in 2026. If this one does, the results could show the extent to which investors are worried about the financial implications of Trump's immigration policies.

The impeachment resolution was originally introduced by Congresswoman Robin Kelly (IL-02).

“Enough is enough. Under Secretary Noem, DHS, and ICE have systemically violated the rights and privacy of Americans, terrorized our cities, and obstructed Congress. Real checks and balances are in order, which is why I have signed onto Articles of Impeachment against Secretary Kristi Noem. I will continue to use every tool available to hold this Administration accountable, to demand answers on behalf of the American people, and keep our communities safe,” said Congresswoman Elfreth.

The Constitution gives the U.S. House sole power of impeachment. The three articles of impeachment are:

1. Obstruction of Congress

Secretary Noem violated her constitutional oath and refused to comply with the law that prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from preventing a Member of Congress from entering a DHS facility used to detain undocumented immigrants.

There’s been documentation in which Members of Congress have tried to enter an ICE facility and were denied in Illinois, Texas, Colorado, California, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

2. Violation of Public Trust

Secretary Noem has repeatedly violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution. She’s also broken due process by directing ICE to conduct warrantless arrests and use violence against US citizens and lawful individuals.

During Secretary Noem’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, federal agents used excessive force, in some cases injuring or killing residents. Federal agents used military-style tactics to raid an apartment building in South Shore, detaining U.S. citizens for hours without warrants or reason for arrest. These dangerous actions have continued in cities across the country, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed without justification.

3. Self-Dealing

Secretary Noem has misused her position for personal gain while inappropriately using $200 million taxpayer dollars to fund an ad campaign for ICE recruitment. She bypassed the normal competitive bidding process to award a contract to a firm called Strategy Group. Strategy Group was formed just days before the award and is run by the husband of senior DHS official Tricia McClaughlin, a close friend of Secretary Noem.

The administration “may not unilaterally usurp the authority over elections” U.S. District Judge David O. Carter in Santa Ana said in his 33-page decision.

Furthermore, the attempt to gather and centralize the personal information would have a chilling effect on voter registration and threaten “the right to vote which is the cornerstone of American democracy,” the judge ruled.

“There cannot be unbridled consolidation of all elections power in the executive (branch) without action from Congress,” Carter said. “This is antithetical to the promise of fair and free elections.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

It has accused states of failing to respond sufficiently to questions about the procedures they take to maintain voter rolls. The department has sued 23 states, most of them controlled by Democrats, and the District of Columbia for detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.

State election officials have questioned what the DOJ plans to do with that information. Last fall 10 Democratic secretaries of state wrote Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to express concern over reports that the DOJ was sharing state voter data with the Department of Homeland Security.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which is part of DHS, operates a program that checks citizenship status.

California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, the state's chief elections officer, said in a statement that California would “continue to challenge this administration’s disregard for the rule of law and our right to vote.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a18b5c2d-a61d-4fb6-91be-ddaf638ea28f/wirestory_0305190ba958051bb86741ac00da36a7_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-16 09:59:04.918565

​​Require ICE to issue and enforce a nationwide policy prohibiting the routine use of masks by agents during civil enforcement actions.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06) and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) sent a letter to the House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee making clear that they will oppose any funding bill that expands Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) resources without strict guardrails and enforceable reforms.

In the letter to Chairman Mark Amodei (NV-02) and Ranking Member Henry Cuellar (TX-28), the lawmakers cited a growing national pattern of illegal and abusive ICE practices—underscored by the murder of Renee Good—including the use of excessive force, prolonged detention in facilities not designed to hold people, denial of medical care and legal access, and a lack of basic transparency. Congressman Moulton and Congresswoman Ansari also raised serious concerns about ICE’s use of masked agents during civil enforcement actions and numerous examples of ICE detaining U.S. citizens.

“Congress cannot keep writing blank checks to an agency that repeatedly violates the law and actively harms its own citizens,” said Congressman Moulton. “ICE has shown over and over again that it cannot be trusted to follow the law and protect the American people. Until ICE stops harming—and in some cases, killing—U.S. citizens and others in its custody, Congress should not spend another federal dollar on this agency. Our power of the purse is one of the only tools we have left to force accountability, and we need to use it.”

“ICE is a rogue agency that Donald Trump is deploying to terrorize communities,” said Congresswoman Ansari. “We must not approve any additional funding for this Trump militia force that has lost the trust, credibility, and legitimacy in the eyes of the American public. Instead, we need accountability in place for ICE’s abuses, including the assault and murder of people on city streets and in detention facilities. I urge our appropriators to hold ICE and Donald Trump accountable for their crimes.”

Congressman Moulton and Congresswoman Ansari state that they will not vote for a Homeland Security Appropriations bill that does not:

Freeze ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations funding at or below Fiscal Year 2024 enacted levels. No increases above that level should be provided without strict conditions on demonstrated compliance with detention standards, civil rights protections, and transparency requirements.

Prohibit the use of ICE field offices and processing centers for overnight or multi-day detention. Congress should require that all individuals be transferred to compliant detention facilities within a fixed number of hours, with mandatory notification to their attorney of record and an identified family member prior to transfer.

​​Require ICE to issue and enforce a nationwide policy prohibiting the routine use of masks by agents during civil enforcement actions.

Reaffirm and strengthen language guaranteeing immediate access for Members of Congress and designated staff to any DHS facility used to detain or hold individuals, without advance notice or administrative delay.

Require regular public reporting on length of stay in field offices, medical staffing levels, complaints received, and corrective actions taken, disaggregated by facility.

Require ICE to publicly report, on a quarterly basis, all instances in which United States citizens or lawful permanent residents are stopped, detained, questioned, or held by ICE. Reports should include the duration of detention, the asserted basis for the action, how citizenship or lawful status was verified, whether force or restraints were used, and whether the individual was transferred or released.

Condition the obligation or expenditure of funds for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations on the full reinstatement and independent operation of ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility and DHS oversight entities, including the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman. DHS should be required to certify to Congress that these offices are fully staffed, retain independent investigative authority, and may transmit findings directly to Congress without alteration, delay, or political interference.

“It’s a rare apology,” Mr. Pomerleau said, but he added that “an apology without a remedy is a hollow apology.”","In a federal court hearing on Tuesday in Massachusetts, the Trump administration acknowledged that it made a mistake when it deported a college student flying home for Thanksgiving.

Any Lucia López Belloza, 19, a freshman at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., was detained at an airport and deported to Honduras in late November after trying to surprise her family with a visit for the holiday.

Despite the administration’s rare admission of error, the government has not moved to drop the case, and it has generally sought maximum authority to detain and deport noncitizens.

Some wrongfully deported migrants were returned to the United States to face further litigation with little fanfare. But in several high-profile cases, such as the expulsion of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, Trump officials have dug in on attempts to carry out deportations even when immigration officials make mistakes.

Ms. López was detained by immigration authorities on Nov. 20 at Boston Logan International Airport. She was flown to Honduras two days later, despite a court order signed on Nov. 21 barring her deportation while her case was still pending.

In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Ms. López said, “I accept their apologies.” She added: “I hope that based on this apology I am able to return back to my studies and also to be home with my parents.”

Since being deported, Ms. López’s family has faced intimidation from immigration authorities. Early last month, agents in three unmarked vehicles appeared at her parents’ home in Austin, Texas. One agent rushed at her father, Francis López, but did not detain him after Mr. López fled into his house and locked the door.

In the court hearing on Tuesday, Richard G. Stearns, a U.S. District Court judge appointed by President Bill Clinton, indicated that he hoped to find a solution so Ms. López could return to the United States and continue her studies.

The Trump administration’s immigration clampdown, which has resulted in thousands of deportations, has at times gone ahead in contradiction of court orders.

In one notable case, more than 200 migrants were flown to El Salvador in March despite a court order demanding that the planes turn back. Mr. Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, was returned in June only to face further detention and deportation threats.

Todd Pomerleau, Ms. López’s lawyer, said on CNN that he appreciated that the administration admitted its mistake, and he hoped that would lead to Ms. López’s swift return.

Local leaders chime in after reports of ICE touring south Kansas City locations for possible detention center

After rumors of a possible detention center began swirling in Kansas City this week, federal agents were spotted in south Kansas City on Thursday. KMBC 9 saw Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the area of East 149th Street on Thursday morning. Jackson County Legislator Manny Abarca said on social media that he confirmed they are looking to build what he called a “mega detention facility.” Plans for these possible detention facilities were first reported in the Washington Post. U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., first spoke against the possible detention sites, which he said would aim to hold 8,000 immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security reportedly awarded a $29.9 million no-bid contract to an organization to carry out the plan. The DHS has not confirmed reports of these facilities. Cleaver strongly condemned the reported plan, saying it will “degrade our society, divide our communities, waste taxpayer dollars, and stress the civility of our institutions to the point of fracture.” And he is not the only local leader who has expressed disapproval of the detention center, should it come to fruition. Mayor Quinton Lucas said his office was working to verify reports of a potential detention center but that it would work to ensure that “no such facility” comes to the Kansas City area. “I want to reaffirm our city’s commitment to being welcoming and inclusive,” Lucas said in a news release. “Kansas City has always been a place that embraces growth and opportunity, not fear and division. We believe in ensuring that all who live and visit our community feel valued and respected.” On the other hand, some local leaders seem to think that some language and actions involving recent ICE rumors have gone too far.

(AP) — As Democrats across the country propose state law changes to restrict federal immigration officers after the shooting death of a protester in Minneapolis, Tennessee Republicans introduced a package of bills Thursday backed by the White House that would enlist the full force of the state to support President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Momentum in Democratic-led states for the measures, some of them proposed for years, is growing as legislatures return to work following the killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. But Republicans are pushing back, blaming protesters for impeding the enforcement of immigration laws.

Democratic bills seek to limit ICE

Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul wants New York to allow people to sue federal officers alleging violations of their constitutional rights. Another measure aims to keep immigration officers lacking judicial warrants out of schools, hospitals and houses of worship.

Oregon Democrats plan to introduce a bill to allow residents to sue federal officers for violating their Fourth Amendment rights against unlawful search and seizure.

New Jersey’s Democrat-led Legislature passed three bills Monday that immigrant rights groups have long pushed for, including a measure prohibiting state law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy has until his last day in office Tuesday to sign or veto them.

California lawmakers are proposing to ban local and state law enforcement from taking second jobs with the Department of Homeland Security and make it a violation of state law when ICE officers make “indiscriminate” arrests around court appearances. Other measures are pending.

“Where you have government actions with no accountability, that is not true democracy,” Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco said at a news conference.

Democrats also push bills in red states

Democrats in Georgia introduced four Senate bills designed to limit immigration enforcement — a package unlikely to become law because Georgia’s conservative upper chamber is led by Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a close Trump ally. Democrats said it is still important to take a stand.

“Donald Trump has unleashed brutal aggression on our families and our communities across our country,” said state Sen. Sheikh Rahman, an immigrant from Bangladesh whose district in suburban Atlanta’s Gwinnett County is home to many immigrants.

Democrats in New Hampshire have proposed numerous measures seeking to limit federal immigration enforcement, but the state’s Republican majorities passed a new law taking effect this month that bans “sanctuary cities.”

Tennessee GOP works with White House on a response

The bills Tennessee Republicans are introducing appear to require government agencies to check the legal status of all residents before they can obtain public benefits; secure licenses for teaching, nursing and other professions; and get driver’s licenses or register their cars.

They also would include verifying K-12 students’ legal status, which appears to conflict with a U.S. Supreme Court precedent. And they propose criminalizing illegal entry as a misdemeanor, a measure similar to several other states’ requirements, some of which are blocked in court.

“We’re going to do what we can to make sure that if you’re here illegally, we will have the data, we’ll have the transparency, and we’re not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you’re in jail,” House Speaker Cameron Sexton said at a news conference Thursday.

Trump administration sues to stop laws

The Trump administration has opposed any effort to blunt ICE, including suing local governments whose “sanctuary” policies limit police interactions with federal officers.

States have broad power to regulate within their borders unless the U.S. Constitution bars it, but many of these laws raise novel issues that courts will have to sort out, said Harrison Stark, senior counsel with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

“There’s not a super clear, concrete legal answer to a lot of these questions,” he said. “It’s almost guaranteed there will be federal litigation over a lot of these policies.”

That is already happening.

California in September was the first to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration officers, from covering their faces on duty. The Justice Department said its officers won’t comply and sued California, arguing that the laws threaten the safety of officers who are facing “unprecedented” harassment, doxing and violence.

The Justice Department also sued Illinois last month, challenging a law that bars federal civil arrests near courthouses, protects medical records and regulates how universities and day care centers manage information about immigration status. The Justice Department claims the law is unconstitutional and threatens federal officers’ safety.

Targeted states push back

Minnesota and Illinois, joined by their largest cities, sued the Trump administration this week. Minneapolis and Minnesota accuse the Republican administration of violating free speech rights by punishing a progressive state that favors Democrats and welcomes immigrants. Illinois and Chicago claim “Operation Midway Blitz” made residents afraid to leave their homes.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Minnesota officials of ignoring public safety and called the Illinois lawsuit “baseless.”

Demonstrators have taken to the streets nationwide to protest the killing of Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen. The administration has responded by sending 1,000 additional agents to Minnesota.

In a video analysis, The Times focuses on some of the key contested moments of the agent’s cellphone video alongside other footage. More videos are likely to emerge, but the visual evidence shows no indication that the agent who fired the shots, Jonathan Ross, had been run over. The footage provides visibility into the positioning between the agent and Ms. Good’s S.U.V., and the key moments of escalation. It also establishes — millisecond by millisecond — how Mr. Ross put himself in a dangerous position near her vehicle in the first place.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/15/arts/VI-MFComps-Anno06_05-00100/VI-MFComps-Anno06_05-00100--facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 01:57:52.421429

He threatened to send in troops following a night of protests and vandalism in the Minnesota city after an agent shot a man in the leg.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said an officer opened fire after he was attacked by three Venezuelan nationals with a shovel and broom handle.

Tensions have been running high in Minneapolis since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, 37, last week, sparking nationwide protests.

The Insurrection Act is a 19th Century law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.

Trump has previously said he might invoke the 1807 law elsewhere without ever doing so.

The president posted on Truth Social that he would use the law if Minnesota officials failed to stop the ""professional agitators and insurrectionists"".

DHS said Wednesday's shooting occurred after a car chase involving a Venezuelan national, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who was previously convicted for driving without a licence.

The agency statement said after the pursuit, Sosa-Celis got out of his vehicle and fought with the federal agent.

Two more illegal immigrants from Venezuela, Alfredo Alejandro Ajorna and Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez-Ledezma, came out of a nearby apartment, according to the agency.

All three attacked the law enforcement officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, DHS said, before the agent opened fire, hitting Sosa-Celis in the leg.

The agent was taken to hospital. Sosa-Celis was also taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries. All three Venezuelans were arrested.

""What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,"" said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.

She said the officer was ""ambushed and attacked"" by the men and fired a defensive shot.

On Wednesday night, clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of Minneapolis, near the scene of the shooting.

City police chief Brian O'Hara said his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs.

Several vehicles belonging to the federal government were damaged in the disorder, and property was stolen from inside the vehicles, according to the FBI.

The FBI said on Thursday that it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the ""recovery of stolen government property and/or the arrest of individuals responsible for the destruction and theft of government property"".

Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has demanded ICE leave the city, said on X on Wednesday: ""No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable.""

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, made a direct appeal to the president on Thursday posting on X: ""Let's turn the temperature down.""

Walz, who has previously called ICE a ""modern-day Gestapo"", told Minnesotans: ""We cannot fan the flames of chaos.""

The Democratic governor, who ran for US vice-president alongside Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, said earlier this month he would end his bid for re-election.

The move came in the wake of a fraud scandal involving the state's welfare programmes.

Warning: This story contains descriptions of violence

The Iranian man, who arrived on Christmas Island by boat from Indonesia in 2013, was transferred by Australian authorities for processing on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.

His complaint to the UN Committee against Torture alleged he was held on Manus Island for around three years in harsh conditions and was subjected to violence, including having his throat slit by a security guard.

""The holding of the complainant in these conditions caused such harm to his physical and mental health that he became suicidal to end the suffering and engaged in self-harm,"" the UN committee's report found.

""Due to the stress, he suffers from a skin condition, psoriasis, which is disfiguring his face and body.""

The man was transferred to the Australian mainland in 2019 to undergo medical treatment, but remained in immigration detention for almost three years before being released into the community on a bridging visa in 2022.

A spokesperson for Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told the ABC it was ""Australia's consistent position that persons in regional processing countries do not engage our international obligations"".

Australia has long argued that while it funded the offshore detention facilities in Papua New Guinea, it did not have control over the Manus Island centre and day-to-day operations — a position rejected by the UN committee.

""Human rights protection and international law obligations do not disappear when detention facilities are relocated offshore,"" said Jorge Contesse, an international law professor and member of the UN Committee against Torture.

""Geography is not the test, but whether a state has placed a person in a situation where it has the power to prevent harm and fails to do so,"" Professor Contesse said in a statement.

Riots at the Manus Island detention centre in 2014 led to the death of another Iranian asylum seeker, Reza Berati.

A PNG court later jailed two staff from the facility for Mr Berati's murder.

Fellow former Manus Island detainee Boochani told the ABC it was ""paradoxical"" that the Australian government would condemn the Islamic Republic regime in Iran, including over its massacre of protesters in recent weeks, while detaining Iranian asylum seekers.

Foreign Minister Penny Wong said this week that ""Australia stands with the brave people of Iran in their struggle against an oppressive regime"".

""We unequivocally condemn the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown on its own people — the killing of protesters, the use of force, and arbitrary arrests must stop,"" she said.

Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who spent six years detained in PNG, said Australia's condemnation of Iran was a ""good step"".

Border Force reported in March 2025 there were 66 Iranians among a total of 980 people held in Australia's immigration detention centres.

Thousands more Iranians were living in the community on bridging visas with limited access to employment and essential services.

""When you keep people who escaped from a brutal regime and you put them in detention, or you leave them in the community without a proper visa, that means from the Australian government perspective — they can go back to their country,"" Boochani said.

""Iran is not a safe country … that is the reality. The Australian government should accept that and give protection to Iranian refugees.""

UN finds Australia also has responsibility for Nauru detention

The UN Committee against Torture this week directed Australian authorities to reassess the Iranian man's asylum claim, as well as provide him with ""appropriate redress, including compensation"" and rehabilitation.

Australia should ensure that ""similar violations do not occur in the future"", it added.

According to Australia's submission to the UN committee, the man remains in Australia on a bridging visa but could face transfer to detention on Nauru upon the expiry of his visa if not resettled to a third country.

A federal government spokesperson said it was ""carefully considering the views of the UN Committee against Torture in this individual complaint"".

In a similar finding to the torture committee, the UN Human Rights Committee found last week that Australia retained responsibility for the arbitrary detention of asylum seekers transferred to the Pacific nation of Nauru.

The UN refugee agency's acting director in Canberra, Karen Gulick, said that Australia's offshore detention policies stood in contrast to its position as a ""strong advocate for refugee protection"" on the international stage.

""We hope that Australia will take the opportunity of the Human Rights Committee's decisions to review its laws and domestic policies in line with its international responsibilities,"" she said.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e0db011c24f9d4b3c501dc6b5479fa82?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=160&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-16 00:58:22.121416

Late last year, Lopez Belloza questioned the Trump administration’s motives following her removal and other deportations of international students.","The Trump administration during court proceedings earlier this week apologized for deporting a student attempting to fly home for Thanksgiving break last year.

Babson College student Any Lucia Lopez Belloza was detained on Nov. 20 at Boston Logan International Airport before boarding a flight to surprise her family in Texas for the holiday.

Lopez Belloza, who entered the U.S. as a child, was sent back to Honduras days after being detained despite a ​​judge’s Nov. 21 order to keep her in Massachusetts or somewhere else in the U.S. for at least 72 hours, according to The Associated Press.

The Trump administration filed a Jan. 2 declaration notifying the court that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer failed to let officials in Port Isabel, Texas, know that Lopez Belloza’s removal needed to be canceled, the AP reported.

However, the officer admitted he believed the judge’s order did not apply once Lopez Belloza was no longer in the state.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter said during a Tuesday hearing, “On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize,” adding that the employee understands “he made a mistake,” according to the AP.

Sauter said the removal was the result of “an inadvertent mistake by one individual, not a willful act of violating a court order.”

Despite the controversy, the Trump administration maintained that it believes Lopez Belloza’s deportation was lawful, citing a decision from an immigration judge in 2016 ordering the removal of her and her mother. An appeal was dismissed a year later.

“I was hoping the government would show some leniency and bring her back. They violated a court order,” Lopez Belloza’s lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said, per the AP.

Still, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns said she was the victim of a “tragic” bureaucratic mistake.

“It might not be anybody’s fault, but she was the victim of it,” Stearns said, noting that Lopez Belloza could reenter the country after securing a student visa.

Late last year, Lopez Belloza questioned the Trump administration’s motives following her removal and other deportations of international students.

“Why is [President Trump] getting people who are living in the United States working day and night, people, people like me, who are in college, doing their dreams, having an education?” she asked in an interview with ABC News.

“It feels unfair,” Lopez Belloza told ABC. “If there was an order, then why did everything happen to me so fast, within three days?”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AP23179543029973-e1762432399547.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-16 03:57:58.084711

What we know

President Donald Trump said today on Truth Social that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians ""don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job.""

The Insurrection Act, a rarely used 1807 law, gives the president the authority to deploy the military domestically without prior congressional approval.

The Department of Homeland Security said a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis last night, alleging the man fled after a traffic stop and attacked the officer.

The shooting came a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in the city, sparking local and nationwide protests and vigils.

Protests have continued, with federal agents using tear gas and flash bang devices on the streets of Minneapolis. Video showed protesters launching fireworks at officers.

Around 3,000 federal agents have been sent to Minnesota in what DHS says is the biggest operation in its history. The city has about 600 police officers, Mayor Jacob Frey said.

Trump and senior government figures have said they are determined to root out ""corruption"" they have linked to the local Somali population.

Gov. Tim Walz called on the federal government to end the ""occupation"" and said agents were ""kidnapping people for no reason.""

'It feels like an invasion': Minnesotans stunned as federal officers flood their state

The federal officers arrived weeks ago. But since the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, their numbers have swelled — and people here say the weight of it all is inescapable. Federal officers are flooding the sidewalks of their neighborhoods, honks and whistles sound when they are near and, occasionally, the smell of chemical agents wafts by.

The scale, the sustained intensity and the aggression demonstrated by law enforcement deployed here appears to be greater than immigration enforcement operations that took place in other blue cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, all of which are larger than Minneapolis in land mass and population.

The officers are in unmarked cars idling on neighborhood streets. They are going door to door, residents said. They are seen inside stores and in retail parking lots, including at the Target in Richfield, south of Minneapolis, the day after Good was killed.

Residents’ videos of violent arrests are proliferating on social media, including one of a woman dragged from her car. Some videos provided to NBC News by activists show officers smashing car windows or spraying chemicals point-blank into the faces of residents.

“It feels like an invasion,” said a woman who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation. She was protesting at the Whipple federal detention facility at 7 a.m. on a frigid, 12-degree morning. The woman, a restaurant owner, said she closed her business temporarily because she was trying to protect her employees who were immigrants. “It feels very much like a Nazi Germany situation to me. It needs to stop, and people need to know what’s going on.”

Lawsuit accuses agents of racial profiling in Minneapolis

The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit today in U.S. District Court for Minnesota against ICE on behalf of three people who say they have been racially profiled in recent weeks, the ACLU said in a statement.

“The Trump administration has been clear in its targeting of the Somali and Latino communities through Operation Metro Surge. President Trump called people from Somalia ‘garbage,’ said ‘we don’t want them in our country,’ and told them to ‘go back to where they came from,’” the statement read in part.

“Following Trump’s comments, ICE and CBP agents have indiscriminately arrested — without warrants or probable cause — Minnesotans solely because the agents perceived them to be Somali or Latino,” it said.

In an emailed statement, the Department of Homeland Security denied wrongdoing and called the allegations “disgusting, reckless, and categorically FALSE.”

L.A. mayor 'deeply alarmed' by reports of ICE activity in Fashion District

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she is ""deeply alarmed"" by reports of ICE activity in the city's downtown Fashion District, which was one of the first areas targeted in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown over the summer.

""This show of force by ICE is particularly troubling given the recent ICE escalation and violence in American cities, including the fatal shootings of Keith Porter Jr. by an off-duty ICE agent on New Year’s Eve here in Los Angeles and Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis,"" Bass said in a statement today. ""Equally troubling are the President’s threats of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would bring military intervention into our cities.""

She said the administration's tactics only ""sow terror"" and ""disrupt basic principles of safety.""

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., also posted on X earlier today that his office received reports of “heavy ICE presence” and agents actively walking the area near 12th and Maple streets in the Fashion District.

'They just shot a lady': Logs show frantic response to shooting

Newly released transcripts of 911 calls and dispatch logs provide an additional look at the chaotic moments after an ICE officer shot Renee Good to death on Jan. 7 — and emergency responders’ attempts to save her.

The documents, which NBC News obtained through public records requests, begin with witnesses calling 911 to report the shooting near the corner of East 34th Street and Portland Avenue. One caller, who isn’t identified in the transcript, says that they saw an ICE officer shoot through a woman’s windshield, that she tried to drive away but crashed and that her partner ran to help. “She’s bleeding,” the caller says.

A second caller tells a dispatcher: “They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car.” He says they shot her “cause she wouldn’t open her car door. There’s video of it, too.” The caller pleads: “Send an ambulance please.”

Dispatch logs indicate that the first 911 call was at 9:38 a.m. The logs indicate screaming in the background of that call. There’s a request for crowd control and to block off the area around the shooting.

By 9:42 a.m., the first EMS personnel arrive, from the Minneapolis Fire Department. They find the victim in the driver’s seat, unresponsive and bloody. They remove her from the car, set her on a snowbank and find apparent gunshot wounds on her chest, left arm and head. They begin trying to save her life, using chest compressions, a tourniquet, breathing devices and other techniques, and are eventually joined by paramedics from Hennepin County Medical Center.

The shooting scene grows more frenzied, with a crowd becoming “hostile,” the logs say. By 10:04, the ICE officer who fired — later identified as Jonathan Ross — has been taken to a federal building. The log says “agitators” gather on the perimeter of the scene, cutting down police tape. A call goes out for someone to have federal personnel leave the scene. The crowd grows more agitated. People try to surround federal officers.

The medics keep working on the victim in an ambulance and at the hospital until they finally stop at 10:30 a.m. Over dispatch, her name is announced: Renee Macklin Good. City Council members and the mayor arrive. Federal officers deploy pepper spray on people near the scene. People throw ice and snow at them. “Going to be overrun shortly,” says a 11:08 a.m. note in the log. Soon after, federal agents leave, the crowd calms, and the FBI arrives to start processing the scene.

Attorneys representing Renee Good's family ask federal government to preserve evidence

Attorneys for Renee Good’s family say they’ve sent a letter asking the federal government to preserve evidence for possible legal action.

The letter was to ensure “no evidence is destroyed,"" including Good’s vehicle and videos and communications sent between agents, law firm Romanucci & Blandin said in a statement today.

“We hope the federal government will comply with their legal obligations. But if they do not, the government’s failure to preserve evidence could lead to potential sanctions for non-compliance with their legal and ethical obligations,” the firm said.

The attorneys also sought to clear up “persistent false reports” and stressed that Good had no criminal or felony record.

“Renee and Becca Good were responsible community members who lived peacefully and did not engage in harmful conduct toward others, including the federal agents involved on January 7, 2026,” the team said.

About 3,000 federal agents are in the Minneapolis area

There are roughly 3,000 federal agents on the ground in the Minneapolis area making immigration arrests, a federal law enforcement official told NBC News.

They include more than 2,000 ICE officers and agents, hundreds of Border Patrol agents and some personnel from Justice Department agencies.

A Minneapolis man said his children had to be taken to the hospital after an officer reportedly threw tear gas toward his vehicle.

The man said he was traveling with his family when the incident happened.

All of the kids were in the back, and “my wife was in the front seat. I was pulling off,” he said. “I don’t know if it came from the bottom, came through the vents, but my car just filled up like it caught on fire.”

He said all six of his children, ages 6 months to 11 years old, were taken to the hospital.

“My kids can’t breathe,” he said.

Classroom changes announced

St. Paul Public Schools, with more than 30,000 students, said it would begin offering an online learning option for students who do not feel comfortable going to school. Schools will be closed next week until Thursday to prepare for those accommodations.

Minneapolis Public Schools, which has a similar enrollment, is also offering temporary remote learning. The University of Minnesota will start a new term next week with different options depending on the class.

Tear gas deployed as ICE officers clash with protesters outside government building

Tear gas has been deployed as dozens of masked ICE officers are clashing with a group of about 100 protesters in front of the Whipple Building.

Masked agents in riot gear are trying to clear protesters off the street in front of the local DHS office building. The protesters have shouted profanity and at times punched vehicles that appear to carry ICE officers.

At least one person has been detained.

Neighbor says he heard gunshots from last night's shooting

Tommy Ross, 72, lives down the block from where last night’s shooting took place. He said he heard gunshots but didn’t see what happened.

“It’s quiet here,” he said. “We don’t have no problems or nothing, and much of this town on North Side is bad, but it’s still quiet.”

He said he watched the protests from his house.

Ross, who has lived in the city for 40 years, said he has never seen its people quite as energized as now.

“Minneapolis has changed,” he said. “But Trump sees that, and he’s trying to take advantage of this small city.”

Suspect charged with assault after allegedly ramming truck into ICE vehicles in Dallas

Federal officials announced assault charges Thursday against a man who allegedly used a truck loaded with heavy equipment to ram into federal agents’ vehicles during an immigration arrest in Dallas last month.

Jerson Lopez-Sanchez, 28, was charged with three counts of assaulting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to a grand jury indictment filed in the U.S. Eastern District of Texas. He is not currently in custody and has yet to turn himself in, the indictment said.

Jay Combs, the U.S. Attorney for the district, told reporters that the ICE agents were clearly identified as law enforcement at the time of the incident.

“When someone runs down an ICE officer — or any federal or local law enforcement officer — those deadly weapons act as battering rams,” Combs said. “It is a violent attack and it will not be tolerated.”

Lopez-Sanchez had no known criminal background or active warrants, according to officials as of Thursday, Combs said.

The charges stem from a Dec. 1 incident in which ICE agents on patrol were asked do a “routine check” on a Chevrolet Silverado, the indictment said. Officials said five people were in the truck but Lopez-Sanchez was the owner and driver of the Silverado.

Gov. Walz makes direct appeal to Trump: 'Stop this campaign of retribution'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made a direct appeal to President Donald Trump in a Thursday post on X.

“Let’s turn the temperature down. Stop this campaign of retribution. This is not who we are,” he wrote.

His plea came after the president warned that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if state politicians didn’t “obey the law” and “stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E.” The rarely used Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy the military domestically without prior congressional approval.

Walz also appealed to Minnesotans.

“I know this is scary. We can — we must — speak out loudly, urgently, but also peacefully,” the governor said. “We cannot fan the flames of chaos. That’s what he wants.”

Streets of northern Minneapolis empty after last night's protests

The residential area where last night's protests occurred is now relatively empty — but remnants of the confrontation remain. Yellow caution tape and other debris are scattered on the sidewalks of the residential area in the city's Hawthorne neighborhood.

AG Pam Bondi says she fired 6 prosecutors after they tried to resign

Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that she fired six prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota after they attempted to resign.

“We had six prosecutors who suddenly decided they didn’t want to support the men and women in ICE,” Bondi said in a Wednesday-night interview.

It was reported that the prosecutors resigned over their concerns about the handling of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.

“They said, ‘We want to resign, but we want to use our annual leave up until April,’ meaning they wanted the taxpayers to pay for them to go on vacation because they decided they didn’t want to support law enforcement,” Bondi said. “So, the breaking news tonight, I fired them all.”

Trump says he will invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians 'don’t obey the law'

President Donald Trump said in a post today on Truth Social that he would invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota politicians ""don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job.""

""I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,"" he wrote. ""Thank you for your attention to this matter! President DJT.""

The Insurrection Act, a rarely used 1807 law, gives the president the authority to deploy the military domestically without congressional approval. Last year, Trump repeatedly floated invoking the Insurrection Act in order to federalize National Guard troops.

Federal law enforcement clashed with enraged Minneapolis residents last night, after an officer shot a Venezuelan man in a leg during an attempted traffic stop.

ICE recruitment error meant some officers were sent out into field without proper training, sources say

NBC News has found that some ICE officers were sent out into the field without proper training. The error was because an artificial intelligence tool used to help ICE identify potential new recruits with law enforcement experience wrongly categorized some potential new officers, sources say.

Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey: Situation is 'not sustainable'

The mayor of Minnesota, Jacob Frey, has said that the situation in his city is not sustainable and described the conduct of ICE as ""intolerable.""

Writing on X, Frey said: ""Tonight a man was shot in the leg by an ICE agent on the Northside. No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable.""

He continued: ""I have seen conduct from ICE that is intolerable. And for anyone taking the bait tonight, stop. It is not helpful. We cannot respond to Donald Trump’s chaos with our own chaos.""

DHS has maintained that the federal operation in Minnesota is necessary to root out local corruption and tackle illegal immigration.

Fireworks and chants of 'go home' at overnight protests in Minneapolis

Protesters and federal agents were engaged in tense standoffs last night, according to footage captured by NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis.

Gov. Walz cautions protesters against 'violence in the streets'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged locals to remain peaceful in their opposition to the federal immigration crackdown in the state.

Writing on X, he said: ""State investigators have been on the scene in North Minneapolis. I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants.""

New tensions in Minneapolis over ICE law enforcement operations

Protestors clashed with federal law enforcement in Minneapolis. A DHS official told NBC News the ICE officer involved in the shooting of Renee Good suffered internal bleeding in the incident. An attorney for the Good family is also speaking out.

ICE may soon be conducting operations in Maine, mayor says

Mayor Carl Sheline said in a statement yesterday that ICE may conduct enforcement in Lewiston “soon.” He did not provide additional details in the statement about how he was made aware of the possible operation.

“I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents,” he said. “Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other. Please check on your neighbors and stay safe.”

He urged residents and businesses to know their rights and prepare a “plan of action” in case ICE stops them.

Asked for comment on Sheline’s post about an operation in Lewiston, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin did not confirm the report.

“Every day, DHS enforces the laws of the nation across the country,” she said. “We do not discuss future or potential operations.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills said her administration has attempted “unsuccessfully thus far” to confirm reports that federal operations are planned in the state.

Nonetheless, her administration is preparing, she said. She said she directed Maine State Police to work with law enforcement, been in contact with city officials in Portland and Lewiston, and is coordinating with the attorney general’s office.

“If any operations take place, our goal — as always — will be to protect the safety and the rights of the people of Maine,” Mills said.

She also issued a warning to the federal government saying: “If your plan is to come here to be provocative and to undermine the civil rights of Maine residents, do not be confused — those tactics are not welcome here.”

Walz to Trump, Noem: ‘End this occupation’ as ICE raids continue

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called out the continued presence of ICE in the state, saying what is happening in the state “defies belief” and said agents were “kidnapping innocent people with no warning.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260115-minneapolis-mb-1029-610c0c.jpg",N,,2026-01-16 00:58:12.668448

She was on the women’s rowing team and studied public affairs, according to her biography from ICE.

A top official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is resigning from her post after less than a year to mount a Republican campaign for Congress in a northwest Ohio district that is one of the most competitive in the country.

Madison Sheahan, 28, announced her campaign for Ohio’s 9th Congressional District on Jan. 15, challenging incumbent Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who won reelection by a narrow margin in 2024. The district includes Toledo and swaths of northwest Ohio.

“In less than one year with ICE, I've stopped more illegal immigration than Marcy Kaptur has in her 43 years in Washington,” Sheahan said in a campaign launch video.

Sheahan, who called herself a “Trump conservative” in the video, graduated from Ohio State University in 2019. She was on the women’s rowing team and studied public affairs, according to her biography from ICE. She was deputy director at ICE before resigning.

Sheahan worked for former South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem — now the secretary of Homeland Security, the department that includes ICE — and then as the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

“When the call came to help President Trump clean up the dangerous immigration mess as deputy director of ICE, I answered the call,” Sheahan said in her video.

If elected, Sheahan would also be the youngest member of Congress. Maxwell Frost, a Democrat from Florida first elected in 2022, is approximately one month older than Sheahan.

Kaptur is the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress. She was first elected in 1982, but her district was drawn to be more Republican in the latest redistricting cycle.

Kaptur was one of 75 Democrats to vote alongside Republicans on a resolution expressing support for ICE in June 2025, which drew pushback from some other Democrats. Ohio’s other Democrats in Congress also supported the resolution.

""While Republicans from near and far will fight through a messy primary in this district they gerrymandered again just this fall, Congresswoman Kaptur is focused on delivering real results for her constituents,"" Kaptur's campaign said in a statement shared with The Dispatch.

""She's working to lower costs for working families, protect access to affordable health care, and bring transformative investments to Northwest Ohio. Voters are tired of the self-dealing corruption and culture of lawlessness they've seen over the last year,"" Kaptur's campaign added.

Sheahan joins a crowded Republican primary field that includes state Rep. Josh Williams, former state Rep. Derek Merrin and Air Force veteran Alea Nadeem. They will face off in the GOP primary in May.

David Gedert − also known as the drag queen Sugar Vermonte − is running as a libertarian in the district.

The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan analyst, identifies the race in OH-9 as a Democrat toss-up.

A demonstrator was hit in the face with a projectile fired by a federal officer at close range during a Southern California protest, leaving him bloodied and with serious injuries, according to video and accounts from fellow protesters and family on Tuesday.

The Friday gathering outside the federal immigration building in the city of Santa Ana was in response to the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal agent, which has kicked off a wave of protests around the country.

Hundreds of people had marched in the streets in Santa Ana until a smaller group was left outside the federal building by evening, shouting expletives through megaphones about Immigration and Customs Enforcement, video showed. At one point, they burned what appeared to be an American flag on the steps of the building while shouting “Justice for Renee Good.”

The verdict was met with cheers, tears and cries of jubilation as the presiding judge announced the words that would end a seven-year legal ordeal for the humanitarians. All 24 had engaged in rescue work on the Aegean island at the height of the refugee crisis.

“It took 2,897 days for the obvious to be delivered by the justice system,” said Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer who represented six of the defendants. “Today, the three-member felony court of appeal of the North Aegean delivered a courageous judgment.”

The European parliament had described the prosecutions as “the largest case of the criminalisation of solidarity in Europe” and proceedings had been closely watched internationally.

Rights groups had spoken of a test-case moment for the treatment of humanitarians across the continent when tolerance for aid work has waned as migrant policies have hardened. Greece – a frontier state – has for years been accused of forcibly expelling migrants from its land and sea borders, with pushbacks especially prevalent in the Aegean. The centre-right government of the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has called the policies “strict but fair” although it has denied the expulsions.

Ahead of Thursday’s court proceedings – resuming six weeks after the criminal trial began in Mytilene – Human Rights Watch called the case a “perverse misrepresentation of life-saving humanitarian work”. It had urged Greek authorities to drop the “baseless” charges.

“The acquittals are a vindication for the defendants but are also bittersweet,” said Eva Cosse, a senior researcher in the group’s Europe and Central Asia division. “These abusive prosecutions have virtually shut down lifesaving work even as people continue to drown in the Aegean. The Greek authorities should stop criminalising solidarity, end pushbacks and prioritise saving lives.”

The defendants included Sara Mardini, the Syrian refugee immortalised in the Netflix movie The Swimmers, and Sean Binder, a German-born Irishman who, like Mardini, spent 100 days behind bars after his arraignment in 2018. At the time of their arrests they ranged in age, with most of the aid workers in their 20s and 30s but some in their early 70s.

Bonded by the same idealistic desire to help at a time when the then-bankrupt country was struggling to cope with an influx of Syrians fleeing civil war, all had volunteered with the search-and-rescue organisation, ERCI. Now dissolved, the aid group had been based in Lesbos, among the islands closest to the shores of Turkey that had fast become a magnet for refugees.

Greek police claimed the aid workers had facilitated the illegal entry of migrants by monitoring maritime radio signals and using encrypted messaging apps to gain advance notification of the location of smugglers’ boats heading from the Turkish coast.

Among the lesser charges the defendants had also faced was espionage. In January 2023, a court threw out that accusation, citing insufficient proof, with supporters hailing the dismissal as indicative of the volunteers’ innocence. Rights groups had described the charge as “farcical”.

Earlier, while giving evidence before the court, defendants had argued that what they had been involved in was legitimate human rights work of helping people on the move, and often at risk of drowning, as they endeavoured to reach safety.

Reacting to the judgment, Binder said: “The court reached the only decision it could today based on the limited legal basis of the charges and the flimsy evidence the prosecutor presented.”

Binder described the gruelling effects of lives put on hold by the prolonged criminal proceedings. First detained at the age of 24, the trainee barrister is now 31.

“It is a huge relief that I will not spend the next 20 years in a prison cell, but at the same time it is troubling that this should ever have been a possibility,” he said.

“Today it was made clear, as it should always have been, that providing life-saving humanitarian assistance is an obligation, not a crime. That using WhatsApp is normal, not evidence of criminality. That buying laundry machines for a refugee camp does not make someone a money launderer. This acquittal must set a precedent.”

Amnesty International, which had sent delegations to Lesbos to monitor the trial, said it hoped Thursday’s decision would send a “strong signal” to Greece and other European countries that “defending human rights should be protected and celebrated, not punished”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/507947fc12dd88f9c9dd7fd8d63f48c7789f7d1c/313_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1e96ad2a67037261a9f694a0e4d007ad",N,,2026-01-15 22:57:39.700868

During a call with reporters on Thursday, several group leaders said the Department of Homeland Security is violating human rights with raids by U.S, Customs and Enforcement agents, and immigrant detentions that they say are not properly documented.

“The government overreach and abuse of power we have seen from the Trump administration is unlawful, unacceptable and un-American, and we would note that the overreach and abusive power are harming not only our communities but also our country as a whole,” UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguia said.

“What the Latino community has experienced in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and most recently Minneapolis, feels like this administration has declared war on our community and that we are under assault by our own government. That is why this coalition is demanding Congress use its oversight and appropriations power to ensure transparency and to hold the administration accountable,” Murguia said.

UnidosUS and 73 other human rights and faith-based organizations on Thursday sent a letter to House and Senate leaders urging lawmakers to rein in abuses and restore accountability to federal immigration enforcement actions.

In the letter, they accuse the federal government of not maintaining comprehensive records on immigrant detentions and they urge lawmakers to ask “urgent questions about when and how federal officers use force.”

“A lack of public accountability and even disinformation spread by public officials about recent events appears intended to indicate that longstanding and well-established legal and constitutional rights are irrelevant in the context of immigration enforcement activities,” they wrote.

They also cite recent immigrant deaths.

The Mexican consulate in Atlanta on Thursday reported the death of a Mexican national in ICE custody near Atlanta, bringing the toll of detained deaths to five in just the first 15 days of 2026, according to immigration data tracker Austin Kocher of Syracuse University. There were a record-setting 30 deaths in ICE custody in 2025, Kocher says.

And the Washington Post reported Thursday that the El Paso County Medical Examiner is likely to classify the death of Cuban-born Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, at ICE’s “Camp East Montana” tent camp detention center in El Paso as a homicide. A detainee says he witnessed Campos being choked to death by guards, according to the Post.

Mark Morial, of the National Urban League, says this is a “state of emergency” and the country “is, quote, creeping toward totalitarianism.”

“The enforcement actions of this administration and the fact that they’re not about immigration or public safety. Millions of people in this country including U.S. citizens are being deprived of the freedom to go about their daily lives due to an unnecessary and excessive show of force,” Murguia said.

National civil rights organizations are calling on Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight authority and include enforceable guardrails in legislation and in Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations to include:

Prohibit the domestic deployment of military personnel or resources for immigration enforcement or policing, reaffirming long-standing limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Ban masked federal agents and require clear identification and body cameras; codify sensitive-location protections for schools, hospitals, courts and places of worship; suspend 287(g) agreements until independent oversight is in place; and ensure arrests and detentions are properly documented and legally authorized.

Require judicial warrants for all arrests and detentions, transparent reporting and independent investigations into deaths or wrongful detentions, access to legal counsel and family for detained individuals, and prohibitions on mass detention, dragnet surveillance, and the use of non-immigration data for enforcement purposes.

“Public Safety depends on trust and cooperation between people and institutions overreach breaks that partnership and makes every community less safe,” said Juan Proano, CEO of LULAC.

President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court.","A federal appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that released former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.

The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel is unconstitutional.

But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two,” the panel wrote. “But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”

Thursday’s decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson, called the ruling “a vindication of the rule of law.”

In a statement, she said the department will “work to enforce his lawful removal order” and encouraged Khalil to “self-deport now before he is arrested, deported, and never given a chance to return.”

It was not clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.

In a statement distributed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Khalil called the appeals ruling “deeply disappointing.""

“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability,"" he said. ""I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Baher Azmy, one of Khalil's lawyers, said the ruling was “contrary to rulings of other federal courts.""

“Our legal options are by no means concluded, and we will fight with every available avenue,” he said.

The ACLU said the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Khalil until the order takes formal effect, which won't happen while he can still immediately appeal.

Khalil’s lawyers can request that the panel's decision be set aside and the matter reconsidered by a larger group of judges on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, or they can go to the U.S. Supreme Court.

An outspoken leader of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia, Khalil was arrested last March. He then spent three months detained in a Louisiana immigration jail, missing the birth of his first child.

Federal officials have accused Khalil of leading activities “aligned to Hamas,” though they have not presented evidence to support the claim and have not accused him of criminal conduct. They also accused Khalil, 31, of failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The government justified the arrest under a seldom-used statute that allows for the expulsion of noncitizens whose beliefs are deemed to pose a threat to U.S. foreign policy interests.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court.

Khalil has dismissed the allegations as “baseless and ridiculous,” framing his arrest and detention as a “direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”

New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said on social media Thursday that Khalil should remain free.

“Last year’s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil was more than just a chilling act of political repression, it was an attack on all of our constitutional rights,” Mamdani wrote on X. “Now, as the crackdown on pro-Palestinian free speech continues, Mahmoud is being threatened with rearrest. Mahmoud is free — and must remain free.”

Judge Arianna Freeman dissented Thursday, writing that her colleagues were holding Khalil to the wrong legal standard. Khalil, she wrote, is raising “now-or-never claims” that can be handled at the district court level, even though his immigration case isn't complete.

Both judges who ruled against Khalil, Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, were Republican appointees. President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman to the 3rd Circuit, while Trump appointed Bibas. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, appointed Freeman.

The two-judge majority rejected Freeman's worry that their decision would leave Khalil with no remedy for unconstitutional immigration detention, even if he later can appeal.

“But our legal system routinely forces petitioners — even those with meritorious claims — to wait to raise their arguments,"" the judges wrote.

The decision comes as an appeals board in the immigration court system weighs a previous order that found Khalil could be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

His attorneys have said he faces mortal danger if forced to return to either country.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem announced Thursday via X that longtime U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attorney Charles Wall will serve as the agency’s new deputy director as enforcement operations intensify nationwide.

""Effective immediately, Charles Wall will serve as the Deputy Director of @ICEGov,"" wrote Noem. ""For the last year, Mr. Wall served as ICE’s Principal Legal Advisor, playing a key role in helping us deliver historic results in arresting and removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from American neighborhoods.""

Wall replaces Madison Sheahan, who stepped down earlier Thursday to pursue a congressional run in Ohio. Her departure left ICE leadership in transition at a moment when the agency has faced increasing resistance to enforcement efforts and heightened threats against officers in the field.

The move comes as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement against murderers, rapists, gang members and suspected terrorists living illegally in the U.S., even as sanctuary jurisdictions and activist groups seek to block or disrupt ICE actions.

ICE officials said Wall brings more than a decade of experience inside the agency.

""Mr. Wall has served as an ICE attorney for 14 years and is a forward-leaning, strategic thinker who understands the importance of prioritizing the removal of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, gang members, and terrorists from our country,"" Noem added.

Wall most recently served as ICE’s principal legal advisor, overseeing more than 3,500 attorneys and support staff who represent the DHS in removal proceedings and provide legal counsel to senior agency leadership.

He has served at ICE since 2012, previously holding senior counsel roles in New Orleans, according to DHS.

DHS has described the appointment as part of a broader effort to ensure ICE leadership is aligned with the Trump administration’s public safety priorities.

The leadership change comes as ICE operations have drawn national attention following protests in Minneapolis after the ICE-involved fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7.

Administration officials have repeatedly emphasized that ICE’s focus remains on what they describe as the ""worst of the worst"" criminal illegal aliens, warning that local resistance and political opposition increase risks for officers carrying out enforcement duties.

“Kansas City should not take part in obstructing or appearing to obstruct legitimate state & federal law enforcement efforts,” Willett said in a text message.
A Port KC spokesperson confirmed that both buildings are owned and operated by Platform Ventures.
Port KC has very limited ability to disallow a sale of the facility,” the Port KC letter said.
Port KC, he said, is trying to get information but Platform Ventures is not returning anyone’s calls.","Following reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is considering opening a detention center in south Kansas City, the Kansas City Council passed an ordinance Thursday stating the city wouldn’t grant such a facility local permits, licensing or other approvals.

The local law enacts a five-year moratorium on approvals for non-municipal detention centers within city limits. In a statement, Mayor Quinton Lucas directly attributed the action to emerging reports regarding the potential ICE facility.

“​​We consistently hear from residents that Kansas City’s focus should be on economic development and housing, not mass detention facilities holding thousands,” Lucas said in a statement Thursday. “Our priority is building businesses, homes, and schools that strengthen and grow our community.”

The statement added that the city intends to “use all available legal tools to enforce the moratorium.”

But one city council member, Nathan Willett of the First District, cast doubts on the effort.

“Kansas City should not take part in obstructing or appearing to obstruct legitimate state & federal law enforcement efforts,” Willett said in a text message. “Upon further legal counsel, I learned the ordinance itself cannot be enforced due to The Supremacy Clause. The city would lose in court.”

Ahead of Thursday’s council vote, several Kansas City-area officials confirmed reports that ICE is considering opening a detention center in the far southern part of the city.

Among them was 6th District Councilmember Johnathan Duncan, who told The Star that the city was “looking at all tools at our disposal to slow and prevent this from happening.”

Jackson County Legislative Chair Manny Abarca said that he confirmed with Department of Homeland Security agents on site that ICE and the DHS are planning to construct a detention center in an industrial building just outside of Grandview city limits to Kansas City’s far south.

Agents allegedly told Abarca that the facility would have capacity for about 7,500 detainees, which is consistent with a Washington Post story earlier this week that listed Kansas City as a potential detention center site.

Abarca took to social media Thursday morning to condemn the proposed detention center, calling on residents and local elected officials to mobilize against its development.

“Local Electeds must step up, and engage,” Abarca wrote on X. “We cannot sit ideally by and let things happen in our community.”

ICE did not respond to an inquiry from The Star.

Questions about the building

The Port Authority of Kansas City, a local development agency that grants incentives, released a letter on Thursday that said it has been “made aware of rumors regarding an industrial building” at 4001 E. 149th St. in South Kansas City.

The building in question appears to be a warehouse and is part of the former Richards-Gebaur Air Force base, which has been turned into an industrial and business park with multiple warehouse-type buildings.

The Port KC letter says that the building, and the land it’s on, are wholly-owned and managed by Platform Ventures, a Kansas City-based real estate company.

While the Port KC letter references 4001 E. 149th St., television news footage appears to show the building across the street and listed as 14901 Botts Rd. The development contains multiple warehouse buildings, including one listed in city records as 4001 E. 149th St. and another listed as 14901 Botts Rd.

A Port KC spokesperson confirmed that both buildings are owned and operated by Platform Ventures.

Port KC’s letter says that the agency entered into a development agreement in 2022 with Platform Ventures to build multiple industrial buildings on the site and called the transformation of the area a success.

“To be clear, the building referenced was built and occupied solely as an advanced logistics and industrial facility. It is wholly owned by a private entity. Port KC has very limited ability to disallow a sale of the facility,” the Port KC letter said.

“Under no circumstances would Port KC offer any development support to a use that is not consistent with our mission to bring quality industrial and logistics jobs to the community. We will continue to monitor any proposed sale or use of the Platform Ventures facility that would change its use.”

Duncan, whose district includes the site, told The Star on Thursday afternoon that his understanding is that Platform Ventures notified Port KC that the firm was going to sell a warehouse it owns to the Honeywell national security campus across the highway.

“It’s only through leaked documents did the city find out that they were actually going to sell to DHS,” Duncan said.

Duncan said that, to his knowledge, Port KC’s calls to Platform Ventures have gone unanswered over the past 48 hours. Port KC, he said, is trying to get information but Platform Ventures is not returning anyone’s calls.

Platform Ventures’ website directed to a 404 error page on Thursday afternoon. Ryan and Terry Anderson, who are listed as co-presidents and co-founders on an archived version of the website, did not immediately respond to email or text messages.

“We should be publicly and privately shaming Platform Ventures,” Duncan said. “They are a Kansas City company that has received public dollars for years and they need to get the message that the Kansas City community does not appreciate being sold out by a local company for quick financial gain.”

ICE expanding

The Washington Post reported last week that Kansas City is one of at least seven cities across the United States where ICE plans to build detention centers with 5,000 to 10,000 beds each. The Post reported that the centers would be built in warehouses and that ICE is seeking contractors in Stafford, Va.; Hutchins, Texas; Baytown, Texas; Hammond, La.; Glendale, Az.; and Social Circle, GA, along with Kansas City.

After the report was published, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Missouri Democrat, condemned the DHS’ plan to open in Kansas City, questioning whether the current federal administration plans to respect local zoning policies and processes. ‘

“Kansas Citians do not want this administration’s reckless, deadly, and incompetent deportation policies in our back yards,” Cleaver wrote in a Jan. 13 letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

Rumors about planned ICE actions in Kansas City, including the use of south KC warehouse as a detention center site, have been mounting among residents and on social media all week, prompting local officials’ probes.

A video went viral earlier this week showing ICE officers arresting an unarmed man outside of the Briarwood Gardens Apartments in Grandview.

Also this week, dozens of marked ICE vehicles could be seen in a parking lot near the Worlds of Fun amusement park in North Kansas City.

Duncan previously said that a KC-area automotive company had been contracted to add decals to the vehicles but that they were not set to be used in any sort of imminent immigration enforcement operation in the city.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, along with its California chapter (CAIR-CA), today condemned the political grandstanding and scapegoating of Afghan nationals and the false and defamatory allegations made against CAIR during a recent Congressional joint subcommittee hearing, calling it part of a broader attack on American Muslims and Muslim-serving organizations, particularly those who support Palestinian human rights.

On Wednesday, Jan. 14, the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a joint subcommittee hearing to address former President Joe Biden’s Afghan Parolee Program.

The hearing included a testimony from Julie Marzouk, a fringe anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim extremist. Marzouk was a founding member of the Intelligent Advocacy Network (IAN), an apparent front group for the Israeli lobby whose primary purpose appears to be smearing critics of the Israeli government.

The organization has posted various conspiracy theories about CAIR and other critics of the Israeli government. The New York Post had to correct an article after it cited a false claim made by the IAN that CAIR-CA had raised tens of thousands of dollars for student vandals on college campuses.

Marzouk was invited by members of the subcommittee who have previously espoused Islamophobic rhetoric, including Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), whose anti-Muslim behavior CAIR has previously condemned, and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), who has participated in the harmful targeting of Texas’ Muslim population.

During the hearing, Senators Hawley and Cornyn and Marzouk repeated baseless allegations and blatant falsehoods recycled from anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim groups in an attempt to discredit CAIR, including factually inaccurate claims of misused and untraced federal funding. All three speakers demonstrated a concerning lack of understanding of grant processes and the U.S. immigration process, even going so far as to claim that CAIR’s immigration attorneys are responsible for vetting immigrants—a process that is performed by federal government officials. Their discordant arguments also referenced Texas Governor Greg Abbott’s politically motivated campaign against the Muslim-led EPIC City Project and Gov. Abbott’s and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ recent defamatory and unconstitutional designations of CAIR as a terrorist organization as “evidence.”

Prior to the hearing, CAIR sent a letter to the subcommittee chairs outlining its California chapter’s immigration work and countering the unsubstantiated allegations against the organization. Earlier this week, CAIR also sent a letter signed by more than 40 organizations in support of CAIR-CA and its service to immigrant communities.

In a statement, CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell, Esq., said:

“The legacy of Senator Joseph McCarthy is alive and well in the Senate. Several senators used this committee hearing to spread debunked conspiracy theories and fan the flames of hate against immigrants, refugees, and Americans critical of U.S. foreign policy, especially American Muslims.

“Calling in an anti-Muslim bigot and acolyte of the Israeli government to serve as a witness is bad enough. Letting such an individual spew hate without any pushback is unacceptable.

“We stand in solidarity with the Afghan American community and the Afghan refugee committee, and we applaud CAIR California for the work it has done to serve the people of California, including new Californians establishing a better life for their families.”

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“The Joint Subcommittee Hearing was a disgraceful display of political grandstanding meant to demonize vulnerable Afghan immigrants and smear the organizations that serve them. Rather than meaningfully addressing policy or community safety, the hearing was used to disparage CAIR and our long-standing work serving immigrant and refugee communities—particularly the Afghan community—by echoing demonstrably false claims pushed by anti-Muslim and pro-Israel groups.

“These unfounded allegations are part of a larger defamation campaign targeting American Muslims by fringe anti-Muslim groups and individuals, such as Julie Marzouk, who intentionally misrepresent public documents and information to create a false narrative. These individuals have been recycling the same tired and refutable claims about CAIR and CAIR-CA and attempted to weaponize the hearing in a flailing effort to fulfill their anti-Muslim and xenophobic political agenda.

“It’s clear that our work threatens Israel-first politicians and activists who would rather Muslims remain silent and invisible in American society. CAIR-CA is proud of our partnership with the State of California in providing critical services to thousands of immigrant families, and we will not be intimidated by these transparent, politically motivated attacks.”

Their proposal comes a day after Congressional Progressive Democrats vowed to oppose any funding for ICE after a Minnesota woman was killed by an immigration officer. The push comes amid recent polling that indicates growing support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Nevada Democrats’ proposal also came on the same day as the centrist Searchlight Institute, founded by a staffer for the late Nevada Democratic Sen. Harry Reid, pleaded with congressional Democrats not to fall into a “trap” by allowing themselves to be accused of wanting to “defund” ICE, the Bulwark reported.

The massive spending bill signed by President Donald Trump last summer allocated $175 billion to immigration enforcement over several years. Cortez Masto and Rosen said on Wednesday they were sponsoring legislation that would reallocate $75 billion to law enforcement.

“The Trump Administration’s actions are not making our communities any safer, in fact they’re doing just the opposite,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “Instead of giving ICE $75 billion extra dollars to hire untrained ICE agents to patrol American communities, let’s invest that money where it will actually help – in hiring local police officers who are trained to fight crime in a way that earns community trust.”

Many local police agencies work with ICE to conduct enforcement. The ACLU found in the first eight months of Trump’s second term “the number of local agencies opting to act as deportation force multipliers has grown by 600 percent.”

Funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which houses ICE, is expected to be debated as the U.S. Senate takes up appropriations bills ahead of a Jan. 30 deadline.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that ICE funding is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

The Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which Rep. Steven Horsford is the only Nevada member, said this week it would oppose any federal funding going toward immigration enforcement.

Their announcement follows the death of 37-year-old Renee Good, who was killed last week by an immigration officer. Her death has sparked nationwide protests, including some in Nevada.

The Trump administration has spent the first year back in office carrying out a campaign promise for more aggressive immigration enforcement and a pledge for mass deportation.

Both Cortez Masto and Rosen noted in their announcement Wednesday that 73% of individuals held in ICE detention didn’t have a criminal conviction while less than 5% had a violent criminal conviction. They also pointed to a ProPublica analysis that found more than 170 U.S. citizens had been detained by ICE.

“The Trump Administration’s mass immigration enforcement is causing chaos and instilling fear in our communities because they are going after law-abiding immigrants and even U.S. citizens,” Rosen said in a statement.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260112_1039-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 00:58:17.169002

“Tran filed his Petition on September 11, 2025. … On November 26, 2025, Respondents filed a response in which they stated that the ‘legal issues presented in [Tran’s] Petition’ were similar to those presented in Morales v. Plymouth County Correctional Facility, No. 25-cv-12602, ECF No. 15 (D. Mass. Sept. 30, 2025), and that ‘should the Court follow [that] reasoning …, it would reach the same result here.’ … Relying on this, the Court followed its reasoning in Morales and ordered that Tran receive a bond hearing. …

“Eight days later, on December 4, 2025, Tran filed the instant emergency motion for reconsideration, … asserting that Morales was inapplicable and that he was still seeking a decision on the arguments presented in his Petition. …

“… Because the Court concludes that ICE exceeded its regulatory authority when it redetained Tran, the Court does not reach the question of whether his redetention was unlawful on constitutional grounds. …

“… When Tran was redetained, there had not been any ongoing effort to remove him. Tran was detained solely on the basis that other pre-1995 arrivals had successfully been removed, and because the government expected that, after completing the process of requesting and receiving travel documents, it would similarly be able to remove Tran. In other words, there was no individualized determination of his circumstances. …

“ICE’s analysis under §241.13(i) must be ‘individualized.’ … The only reasons that ICE had for redetaining Tran on September 11 were that (1) other pre-1995 arrivals had successfully been removed and (2) Tran had completed a self-declaration form. As noted, these two facts alone are not sufficient, in light of the factors enumerated in §241.13(f), to establish that Tran was reasonably likely to be removed in the reasonably foreseeable future. …

“The Court next considers whether this action is moot or requires a different outcome in light of the further steps taken by Respondents during the three months that Tran has been detained — namely, completing his application for travel documents and presenting it to the Vietnamese government. The Court concludes that it is not. Though the government has taken further steps, the record does not yet suggest that Tran’s removal is significantly likely in the reasonably foreseeable future, particularly given the number of pre-1995 arrivals who are not promptly removed following the submission of a request for travel documents. The Court thus concludes that Tran’s present detention exceeds Respondents’ regulatory authority. …

“For the reasons stated above, Tran’s Petition is granted. Respondents are hereby ordered to release Tran pursuant to the Order of Supervision that was in effect prior to his redetention.”

Following the federal funding deal passed in mid-November 2025, Congress faces another January 30th deadline to pass the remaining appropriations bills to fully fund the government for fiscal year (FY) 2026; this includes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations bill.

Recent atrocities committed against both immigrants and citizens under the Trump administration have shone a light on abuses of power by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and its parent agency, Customs and Border Protection (CBP). However, these abuses are hardly new. Since ICE and CBP were established in 2003, the agencies have terrorized immigrant communities, conducted unconstitutional border checkpoints, torn apart families, denied immigrants their due process rights, and subjected detained immigrants to physical, sexual, and mental abuse. The killing of Renee Good in Minnesota was the 9th ICE shooting since September 2025.

ICE also received an influx of billions in additional funding from the so-called “One Big Beautiful” bill. The bill placed no guardrails or conditional oversight on the use of this money, essentially creating a $75 billion slush fund for ICE to continue their violent attacks on communities across the country.

Call on your representatives to block any DHS appropriations bill or Continuing Resolution (CR) that maintains funding for ICE. This lawless and violent agency must be defunded and dissolved for good.

The two people who came out of the apartment are in custody, it said.

The city of Minneapolis said on X that the man shot was in the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

""We understand there is anger,"" it said. ""We ask the public to remain calm.""

The shooting took place about 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) north of where Good was killed.

Clashes in court as well

Earlier Wednesday, a judge gave the Trump administration time to respond to a request to suspend its immigration crackdown in Minnesota, while the Pentagon looked for military lawyers to join what has become a chaotic law enforcement effort in the state.

""What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,"" state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement. U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case ""on the front burner"" and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to a request for a restraining order.

The judge said these are ""grave and important matters,"" and that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

The judge is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

During a televised speech Wednesday evening, Gov. Tim Walz described Minnesota as being in chaos, saying what's happening in the state ""defies belief.""

""Let's be very, very clear, this long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,"" he said. ""Instead, it's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.""

Walz added that ""accountability"" will be coming through the courts.

Military lawyers may join the surge

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down. The Pentagon is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist.

CNN, citing an email circulating in the military, says Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is asking the branches to identify 40 lawyers known as judge advocate general officers or JAGs, and 25 of them will serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in Minneapolis.

Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson appeared to confirm the CNN report by posting it on X with a comment that the military ""is proud to support"" the Justice Department.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to emails from The Associated Press seeking more details.

It's the latest step by the Trump administration to dispatch military and civilian attorneys to areas where federal immigration operations are taking place. The Pentagon last week sent 20 lawyers to Memphis, U.S. Attorney D. Michael Dunavant said.

Mark Nevitt, an associate professor at Emory University School of Law and a former Navy JAG, said there's concern that the assignments are taking lawyers away from the military justice system.

""There are not many JAGs but there are over one million members of the military, and they all need legal support,"" he said.

An official says the agent who killed Good was injured Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer who killed Good, suffered internal bleeding to his torso during the encounter, a Homeland Security official told The Associated Press.

The official spoke to AP on condition of anonymity in order to discuss Ross' medical condition. The official did not provide details about the severity of the injuries, and the agency did not respond to questions about the extent of the bleeding, exactly how he suffered the injury, when it was diagnosed or his medical treatment.

There are many causes of internal bleeding, and they vary in severity from bruising to significant blood loss. Video from the scene showed Ross and other officers walking without obvious difficulty after Good was shot and her Honda Pilot crashed into other vehicles.

She was killed after three ICE officers surrounded her SUV on a snowy street a few blocks from her home.

Bystander video shows one officer ordering Good to open the door and grabbing the handle. As the vehicle begins to move forward, Ross, standing in front, raises his weapon and fires at least three shots at close range. He steps back as the SUV advances and turns.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was struck by the vehicle and that Good was using her SUV as a weapon — a self-defense claim that has been deeply criticized by Minnesota officials.

Chris Madel, an attorney for Ross, declined to comment on any injuries.

'An agent of peace'

Good's family, meanwhile, has hired a law firm, Romanucci & Blandin, that represented George Floyd's family in a $27 million settlement with Minneapolis. Floyd, who was Black, died after a white police officer pinned his neck to the ground in the street in May 2020.

The firm said Good was following orders to move her car when she was shot. It said it would conduct its own investigation and publicly share what it learns.

""They do not want her used as a political pawn,"" the firm said, referring to Good and her family, ""but rather as an agent of peace for all.""

Students march against ICE

Waving signs reading ""Love Melts ICE"" and ""DE-ICE MN,"" hundreds of teenagers left school in St. Paul and marched in freezing temperatures to the state Capitol for a protest and rally.

The University of Minnesota, meanwhile, informed its 50,000-plus students that there could be online options for some classes when the new term starts next week. President Rebecca Cunningham noted that ""violence and protests have come to our doorstep."" The campus sits next to the main Somali neighborhood in Minneapolis.

They think so,John Domen,,,,,https://wtop.com/maryland/2026/01/can-democratic-lawmakers-curb-federal-immigration-efforts-in-maryland-they-think-so/,"While affordability and the state’s budget are the themes talked about by Democratic legislators, some of the laws they intend to quickly pass will target the efforts of federal immigration officers operating in the state of Maryland.
One bill, Senate Bill 1, which is reserved for legislation that wants to make a symbolic point, would prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while conducting normal operations.
“Anything that is not expressly outlined in the Constitution is the responsibility of the state,” Ferguson said.
“How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution.” Folden expressed skepticism about that.
“They’re literally federal law enforcement officers that have a job description, and they’re enforcing the law of the land.","While affordability and the state’s budget are the themes talked about by Democratic legislators, some of the laws they intend to quickly pass will target the efforts of federal immigration officers operating in the state of Maryland.

One bill, Senate Bill 1, which is reserved for legislation that wants to make a symbolic point, would prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing masks while conducting normal operations.

“I think all of us can sit back and imagine if you’re sitting in your car and somebody runs up to you, even as a law enforcement agent that quickly shows us a badge and has their face covered, I know I would be terrified,” said Senate President Bill Ferguson. “It’s just not how you build trust in policing.”

With a super majority in both chambers, a version of the bill is expected to pass over the objections of Republicans like Frederick County State Sen. William Folden.

“I don’t think that as a state, we’re allowed to tell the federal government — we can’t tell them what their policies are going to be,” Folden said. “Let’s be very transparent on this. If we didn’t have… activists going out and doxing these agents and their families and putting their addresses out on social media and endangering them — their well being — as well as their family. You wouldn’t have this problem.”

Folden, who spent decades with Maryland State Police, calls the bill an “irrational response” from Democrats who want to distract voters from issues of affordability, especially as it pertains to energy bills around the state.

Ferguson said under the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the state has the power to pass bills like this.

“Anything that is not expressly outlined in the Constitution is the responsibility of the state,” Ferguson said. “How a law enforcement entity operates in the state of Maryland is subject to Maryland state laws and constitution.”

Folden expressed skepticism about that.

“I don’t know that that’s accurate,” he said. “They’re literally federal law enforcement officers that have a job description, and they’re enforcing the law of the land.

Folden compared the high number of deportations under former President Barack Obama’s administration to ICE’s operations in the U.S. under President Donald Trump.

“We didn’t see this,” he said. “We didn’t see these people out there doxing federal agents.”

Ferguson did admit the issue would likely end up in the courts.

Another issue likely to be decided in a courtroom is the participation of local enforcement agencies with Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s 287(g) program, which allows local officers to help ICE identify and remove noncitizens arrested for another crime. Efforts to keep local agencies from participating in that program stalled out last year.

Ferguson and House Speaker Joseline Peña-Melnyk say that won’t happen this time.

“Immigrants deserve to live with dignity and respect,” Peña-Melnyk said. “How can we as Americans stand by the disrespect? The abuses? People losing their lives? Racial profiling? Civil rights violation?

“It doesn’t matter whether you’re a Republican, a Democrat,” she added. “What’s right is right, what’s wrong is wrong. You don’t treat any human being that way. My God, that I believe in, loves everyone.”

Ferguson described ICE as a “paramilitary force” that was “offensive to humankind” during his comments Wednesday.

“Of course, we should enforce the law, but we don’t need to do it in a way that disrespects humanity,” Ferguson said. “So until there is a major shift, until there is a major restructuring of how that organization functions, Maryland should not be partnering and furthering an organization that does not follow Maryland values.”

But Folden touted the system and said scrapping it will only lead to more chaos.

“The process we have in place is very uniform,” Folden said. “It’s justified, as they’re already under arrest for another offense, and it’s not invasive into our communities, as far as boots on the ground going in and being disruptive. It’s only when they have another contact with law enforcement for an arrestable offense.”

He said the elimination of the program in Maryland would likely lead to the sort of efforts and encounters happening in Minnesota.

Folden also isn’t sure the state has the power to tell elected sheriffs, whose jobs exist under the state constitution, when they can and can’t engage with federal agencies. If the bill is passed into law, it’ll be a judge who makes that determination.

“They’re already lining up. They’ve already got counsel,” said Folden, about some sheriffs’ offices. “They’re lining up because everyone can see the writing on the wall. It’s about virtue signaling. It’s not about anything else except hiding their own mismanagement of funding and taxpayer dollars.”

I see a White House that is panicking and that is losing. [HONKING, SCREAMING] I think that this aggression represents political weakness. It’s an attempt to shut people up, because what they’re saying and what they’re doing is actually impeding your ability to accomplish your goals. When you actually look closely at what’s happening in Minnesota, what you see are hordes of agents, a dozen people, 20 people, trying to execute a single arrest. And that is because an organized network of observers is working to prevent escalation and prevent violence. ICE can’t do anything without being followed, and that reduces the odds that they act in dangerous and aggressive ways. Minnesotans, in other words, are standing up for their communities and pushing back against ICE and the Customs and Border Protection in a real way that is preventing them from doing their worst. But if you zoom out from Minnesota and look at the national political picture, what you see is an embattled agency. ICE has never been more unpopular than it is right now. First, majorities of Americans in a recent YouGov poll, 53 percent, said that they did not think that the shooting of Renee Nicole Good was justified. 42 percent of Americans said that they would support the elimination of ICE as an agency. Abolish ICE has very quickly gone from what some may have considered the fringes of American politics to the mainstream. And short of ending the agency, there is majority support for slashing its funding, for putting restrictions on agents, for requiring them to remove their masks and show identification. [SHOUTING] The public, broadly, is just tired of what they’re seeing and want something to be done about it. And I think the administration knows that. I think the administration knows, I think the president knows they made a mistake in the initial aftermath of Good’s killing when they condemned her as a domestic terrorist. “This was an act of domestic terrorism.” And then we see things like the Department of Justice going to investigate Good and her wife and lawyers at the D.O.J. resigning in response. And so to save face, the administration has unleashed ICE on the people of Minnesota. It’s doing the only thing it seems to know how to do, which is to escalate with its aggression, under the idea that you can just shut people up if you kick them hard enough. But what we’re clearly seeing is that this approach doesn’t cause people to retreat. It causes them to dig in, to double down, to show more resolve in the face of what is plainly tyranny.

But ultimately, the deployments ended because of esoteric case law and round-the-clock legal preparation and wrangling, according to the Democratic attorneys general from those states.

Earlier this month, President Trump pulled hundreds of National Guard troops from California, Oregon and Illinois after the Supreme Court ruled against the administration in the Illinois case.

It was a major win for the Democratic states that had been fighting against the deployments, after troops had been federalized against the wishes of those states' governors. It required nearly constant coordination and communication between states as they worked to understand and define the archaic and rarely used legal mechanism that the Trump administration used to justify the deployments.

""We were in uncharted territories. This had never happened before,"" remembers California Attorney General Rob Bonta. ""And California was on the front lines from day one.""

In June of last year, in a bold and unprecedented move, Trump seized control of California's National Guard — against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes — and deployed more than 4,000 troops, along with the Marines, to the streets of downtown Los Angeles to protect federal immigration officers and facilities as protests broke out against them.

It was the first of what would become a pattern in the following months, as Trump deployed the National Guard to several Democratic-led cities around the country, claiming that the deployments were necessary because of violence and rampant crime — a claim that data contradicted and several local and federal judges called into question.

NPR reached out to the White House for comment on this story. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that ""if Democratic leaders had spent half as much time addressing crime, their communities would be much safer,"" reiterating that Trump is committed to safety and security.

Even before Trump's re-election, several Democratic attorneys general had been prepping for the likelihood that he would deploy the military to U.S. cities if he won a second term. It's something that he and some of his closest advisors had talked openly about on the campaign trail as an option to assist with immigration enforcement efforts.

""We had done a lot of homework for this exact issue,"" says Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield.

Once Trump deployed Guard troops to Los Angeles, the legal mechanism the administration would likely use became clearer. Deployments to California – and eventually Oregon and Illinois – were all done citing a 19th century law called 10 U.S.C. 12406, which had very little precedent around it.

The law hinges on vague terms that can be open for interpretation, like ""rebellion"" and ""invasion.""

""Since this law has been used so rarely in our history, we had very little sense of what any of these terms meant, because none of them are defined by the statute,"" says Chris Mirasola, a national security law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.

That meant that the court battles against these deployments could help define the law.

""Case law and litigation becomes a really important mechanism by which we kind of give these terms meaning,"" Mirasola says.

Bonta in California says that's one reason he and his team felt so much pressure to get their legal response right.

""Our case was first. So if we stumbled, or if there was bad precedent set, or if there was a broad, expansive view of Trump's authority and that allowed him to do what he did in L.A. and then repeat it or escalate it into more cities, there was a lot at stake,"" Bonta says.

Meanwhile, other Democratic states were watching California, hoping to learn from their legal fight.

""We were definitely in touch (with Bonta's office) right when it happened, not knowing when the hammer would drop for us,"" remembers Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul.

Bonta encouraged his team to share as much as they could with other states.

""I basically said, 'Tell them everything,'"" he said.

California reached out to other states, other states reached out to each other.

Over the course of several months, Trump threatened deployments to Baltimore and Oakland, Calif. He deployed troops to Washington, D.C. — a unique situation where the president controls the National Guard. And then, later in August and into September, Chicago and Portland, Ore. became the clear focus.

""We were on high alert,"" remembers Rayfield, of Oregon, who says he told his team that the goal was to block the deployment before troops could be on the streets of Portland, which is different from what happened in Los Angeles. ""It was a unique approach. And frankly, I don't think that was universal among all attorneys that that was the right approach, but that was the approach we were going to take in Oregon.""

The office in California went full force, sharing as much legal insight with Oregon and Illinois as possible.

The coordination came in handy in the first weekend of October, when all three states found themselves involved in lawsuits surrounding the deployments.

Rayfield remembers the attorneys and staff in his office working to file a lawsuit against the deployment in Portland within 12 hours. And it worked — by Saturday, a federal judge had issued a temporary restraining order.

""We're thinking, 'Shoot, we got a win.' And then we were able to have a little bit of a sigh of relief. But only for a few hours,"" Rayfield said.

The next morning, on Sunday, Trump said he was deploying California's National Guard — which were still federalized and under his control — to Oregon.

Bonta remembers he was out celebrating his mother's 88th birthday when he started getting calls and texts. He eventually stepped away and got on the phone with Rayfield, while both of their staffs were in near-constant communication. That evening, the same federal judge issued a second temporary restraining order, blocking any other states' National Guard from the streets of Portland as well.

At almost the exact same time, Raoul in Illinois was facing a similar situation. Trump had federalized the Illinois National Guard to deploy troops to Chicago. When that deployment hit legal roadblocks, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered to send troops from his state.

Raoul and his staff were also working round the clock, calling their counterparts in Oregon and California for guidance and insight.

""Fortunately, we've gotten to a point where we've got each other on speed dial,"" Raoul says. ""There's no inappropriate time to call one another, and communication had to happen that weekend, or you know, whenever.""

A few days later, a federal judge in Illinois also issued a temporary restraining order, blocking troops from the streets of Chicago.

Raoul says it was an emotional time for him and his staff; the situation and its implications felt so heavy.

""I remember, I went down and did a press availability afterwards, and I started cracking a little bit, you know, my voice. And I was like, I'm okay if some tears come down my eye, because this is some real serious s—,"" he says.

In every case, the Trump administration appealed any ruling not in their favor. In Illinois that appeal went all the way to the Supreme Court. In all three states, troops remained at the ready for months as the Trump administration waited.

And then, in the final weeks of 2025, there were two major wins for those three states.

Right before Christmas, the Supreme Court ruled against Trump, upholding the block on troops in Chicago. That ruling only applied to Illinois, but it was a decision that helped define the law, making it harder for the administration to use that same legal pathway in the future. And on New Year's Eve, Trump announced he would pull troops out of all three states, for now.

But there are still other legal mechanisms the administration could use to deploy the military in U.S. cities, including invoking the Insurrection Act, which Trump has frequently mentioned – including as recently as Thursday, in response to protests in Minneapolis against a surge of federal immigration activity.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero says large-scale ICE operations in other cities are ""spreading fear and chaos in cities across our country."" There's been no federal announcements from federal officials about Tucson-specific operations, but earlier this month, advocates in Phoenix warned of a spike in federal immigration enforcement efforts there.

""The actions that we’ve seen ICE take are hurting innocent people and not making us any safer,"" Romero said Tuesday in a news release. ""The City of Tucson will prioritize community safety and protect the legal and constitutional rights of every Tucsonan regardless of status.""

Romero directed city staff to create an informational website for the public to know their rights. It can be found at: http://tucne.ws/1tqm.

The page includes information on local legal services for immigration, what to do if immigration authorities come to your workplace, family preparedness plans, rights available to those who are arrested or detained and rights for those in the midst of immigration raids.

Similarly, Pima County Attorney Laura Conover asked that Tucsonans avoid ""recklessness"" during interactions with federal immigration agents.

""Here in Pima County, we expect our community members and our own local police to be safe from recklessness. And to that end, I am urging our community not to meet recklessness with more recklessness. We must be smart and fight fire, not with more fire but with water,"" Conover said Monday in a statement.

""We must move in ways that are wise and pray that keeps us all alive,"" she said.

Throughout last year, several ICE actions in Tucson have been documented.

In February, three federal agents visited longtime Tucson restaurant La Indita to verify the legal status of its employees, which the owner called an attempt at “intimidation.” In May, an undocumented migrant who has lived in Tucson for over 15 years was arrested by immigration agents outside St. Joseph’s Hospital after his wife said hospital staff extensively questioned a relative whom he was accompanying about his legal status.

In June, an undocumented man from Honduras narrowly avoided being picked up by immigration agents who posed as utility workers.

Plain-clothes immigration agents arrested Tucson physical therapist Vone Phrommany in August due to a non-violent crime he committed 35 years prior, as a teenager. Phrommany was deported to Laos, the country he fled his family at age 6 in the 1970s, after spending three months in immigration detention.

Fear of federal raids in Tucson reached its height in early December, when agents with Homeland Security Investigations arrested 46 people at multiple Taco Giro restaurants in connection to a years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations. Days later, HSI special agents served a search warrant on a Tucson trucking business on West Miracle Mile.

Conover, in her statement, asked residents to ""stay cool, calm, and collected so that you do not rush to judgement and mistake criminal investigations with warrants signed by judges with an 'ICE sweep' that has yet to occur here,"" seemingly referencing the HSI investigation.

But fears of an amped-up federal presence in cities across the nation have hit a fever pitch in the past week, following the shooting death of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE officer last week.

City and county agencies ""have developed a protocol and response if the National Guard is activated by the president without being requested by the City or the State,"" this week's release said.

""Evidence from activations in other U.S. cities indicates that federalized troops may have been encouraged to engage in security, traffic, and crowd control activities in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,"" the city says. ""If deployed to Tucson, the City would observe and document such troop activities. The City is prepared to file legal challenges to any improper troop deployment or activity with authorization from Mayor and Council.""

""The Tucson Police Department does not participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws but will respond for the safety of Tucson residents and to keep the peace if protests or demonstrations develop,"" the city says. ""However, federal officials do conduct operations in our city related to drugs, violent crime, human trafficking and other critical issues, and TPD may be involved in these operations.""

The city says that, in the event of a federal deployment to Tucson, a ""Joint Information Center"" or JIC will be established so that communications from the city to residents ""is unified and clear."" If such a deployment happens, the city says it will make ""accurate and timely information"" on the city's website (https://www.tucsonaz.gov), on its social media accounts, including X and Facebook, as well as news conferences live-streamed to the city's YouTube page when needed.

U.S. suspends immigrant visa processing for citizens of 75 countries

In one of the most sweeping immigration actions of his second term, President Donald Trump ordered the Department of State to pause issuance of all new immigrant visas to applicants from 75 countries beginning 21 January 2026. According to a State Department cable reviewed by Reuters, consular officers world-wide have been instructed to deny any immigrant visa that has not yet been printed, even if it was previously approved. The administration says the affected countries—spanning Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe—have high rates of welfare usage among recent immigrants and therefore pose an unacceptable ""public-charge"" risk. (reuters.com)

Trump officials emphasize that the pause does not extend to non-immigrant categories such as B-1/B-2 visitors, H-1B professionals, F-1 students, or J-1 exchange visitors; however, business-travel groups note that the same countries often struggle with long appointment backlogs for those categories, raising concerns about ripple effects on corporate travel. The State Department says it will conduct a “top-to-bottom review” during the pause and may reinstate processing for countries that agree to improved data-sharing on applicants’ tax compliance and proof of financial self-sufficiency.

Immigration attorneys warn that the order could bar roughly 315,000 family- and employment-based immigrants over the next 12 months, disrupting U.S. hiring plans and family-reunification pipelines. Employers that rely on multinational transfer programs worry that the new scrutiny on dependents’ ability to remain off public benefits could lengthen consular reviews and raise the risk of refusals. Several U.S. universities with pipeline programs in Nigeria, Pakistan, and Brazil have already convened emergency webinars to advise affected students who planned to adjust status after graduation.

Amid this uncertainty, specialized visa-service platforms such as VisaHQ can help companies and families audit pending cases, receive real-time policy alerts, and map out alternative filing strategies. Its U.S. portal (https://www.visahq.com/united-states/) offers country-specific checklists and live support that can identify non-immigrant options or adjustment-of-status pathways while the 75-nation freeze remains in effect.

Human-rights advocates point out that the administration’s own data show immigrants use most means-tested benefits at lower per-capita rates than native-born Americans. They predict a rise in green-card applications filed inside the United States—where the public-charge test is administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rather than consular officers—in order to sidestep the freeze. USCIS, however, is already facing historic case-backlogs and fee-funding shortfalls.

For global-mobility managers, the immediate priority is to identify employees or dependents whose immigrant-visa appointments fall on or after 21 January, communicate the risk of cancellation, and, where feasible, convert filings to adjustment-of-status inside the United States. Companies with diversity-hire targets that include talent from the listed countries may need to update workforce-planning models and explore alternative work-visa strategies.

Children hurt in north Minneapolis protest

What they're saying:

The father, Shawn Jackson, told a FOX 9 reporter at the scene his children were hurt when a flash bang detonated nearby. He says the blasts were strong enough to set off his vehicle's air bags.

""Officers threw flash bangs and tear gas in my car. I got six kids in the car […] My 6-month-old can't even breathe. This was flipped over,"" Shawn said, holding up his child’s car seat. ""My car filled with tear gas, I'm trying to pull my kids from the car.""

His wife, Destiny Jackson, told FOX 9 their 6-month-old infant stopped breathing and lost consciousness. She then performed CPR on her baby while others poured milk on her other children in an effort to neutralize the tear gas.

Three of children, including the baby, were then taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. All of the children are between 6 months old and 11 years old.

Destiny says they have never gone out to protest, but this incident has given her the drive to do so.

""My kids were innocent, I was innocent, my husband was innocent, this shouldn't have happened,"" Destiny said. ""We were just trying to go home.""

The backstory:

Protesters began gathering at the scene of the shooting just minutes after it happened.

A video spread on social media is believed to show the immediate, chaotic aftermath of the shooting, with the man calling 911 to say he was shot in the leg.

The package would also require someone to prove their immigration status if they want to apply for benefits, certain jobs, or buy a car.
That is strictly a role of the federal government,” Sherman Luna said.
A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
“We need educators focused on the lesson plans of the week, not on becoming ICE agents,” Sherman Luna said.","Tennessee will be the first state to pilot the White House’s immigration agenda, which focuses on increasing verification for legal residents and requiring local law enforcement to partner with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Republican leadership in the Statehouse partnered with U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller and the Justice Department to craft the legislation.

Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, announced Thursday that the package would require local law enforcement in the state to partner with ICE under the 287(g) program, among other policies.

“Nashville is saying, ‘We’re not working with ICE. … We can’t be a sanctuary city, but we can house them here.’ So, they’re using their ability not to have to work with the federal government … (to) turn a blind eye,” Sexton said.

The package would also require someone to prove their immigration status if they want to apply for benefits, certain jobs, or buy a car.

“We’re not spending taxpayer dollars on you unless you’re in jail,” Sexton said.

Some policies, like making it a crime to live in Tennessee without legal status, would not change much of life for the state’s immigrant communities, said Lisa Sherman Luna with the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.

“States have no business in making laws around immigration. That is strictly a role of the federal government,” Sherman Luna said. “Immigrant families already face so many barriers in a place like Tennessee. Over the last few decades, so many laws have been passed that make life harder.”

A bill to end the right to a K-12 education for students, regardless of legal status, will be back this year, but lawmakers said they are still waiting on a green light from the federal government.

A state review found the bill could’ve jeopardized more than $1 billion in federal education funding if enacted, as it violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Given the potential loss, House leadership paused consideration of the bill after it passed the Senate last year and wrote to the U.S. Department of Education for guidance.

“That’s the biggest question remaining,” said Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixon, who sponsored the bill. “We’re still waiting on the Department of Education at the federal level to send us some guidance from them on what that looks like on funding.”

Requiring schools to verify immigration status will add a host of costs and bureaucratic red tape, Sherman Luna said.

“We need educators focused on the lesson plans of the week, not on becoming ICE agents,” Sherman Luna said.

“I am asking City Council to recognize that ICE is bad for public safety, it’s bad for business.","Hours before Woodbury city leaders would publicly shut down rumors surrounding a warehouse on Hudson Road, members of Indivisible gathered at Central Park to press for stronger, written opposition to any future Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in the city.

Indivisible, a national grassroots network with more than 1,000 local groups advocating for progressive government, hosted a press conference in the Central Park auditorium ahead of Wednesday night’s City Council meeting.

Before the press conference, Woodbury News Net spoke with Martha Winslow, who leads the St. Croix Valley district of Indivisible and has lived in St. Mary’s Point for 20 years. The organization’s mission, according to Winslow, is to “push back against the current authoritarian regime” and “propose what they want in the future” by “building a forward democracy.”

Winslow has been involved with Indivisible since 2016 and first connected with the group through political organizing while volunteering as a door knocker for a DFL House candidate. She has been retired for nearly seven years.

“This mission is not about a specific building, it’s about providing credible reporting and getting out in front of the federal government by actively addressing the issue to the City Council and asking them to issue more than a Facebook post,” Winslow said.

Winslow added that the group is seeking formal action in the form of official letters and, ultimately, a resolution preventing a detention center from being established in Woodbury. She said such a resolution was unlikely to be adopted Wednesday night but could come within the next month.

Asked how Indivisible’s message differed from recent city statements opposing a detention facility, Winslow said she believed the city’s language may have signaled to residents that attendance at Wednesday’s meeting was unnecessary. She said showing up in large numbers was intended to shift the tone of city officials’ public messaging beyond reassurance.

The press conference opened with Sen. Amanda Hemmingsen-Jaeger, a DFL Party member representing Senate District 47, who spoke broadly about the national political climate.

“I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I gotta be honest, I don’t recognize today’s world. We are experiencing events that should never happen,” Hemmingsen-Jaeger said.

She closed her remarks by urging calm among Woodbury residents, saying, “Please remember to stay peaceful. Don’t give these bullies what they want. Be kind and look out for one another and know your rights.”

Washington County District 5 Commissioner Michelle Clasen followed, explaining that she had contacted the Washington Post reporter who published the Dec. 24 article listing Woodbury among potential ICE detention sites.

“I received word that this information that they had was more concerning, and as I listened to him speak about it, I realized that there was something that I had heard from the City Council in the past, and that was, we can’t do anything if a building or if a developer wants to come in and build,” Clasen said.

Clasen said she then reviewed Woodbury’s city code and concluded that converting a warehouse into a detention facility would require public hearings and other zoning approvals that would typically go through the city government to get approved. After sharing those findings on Facebook, she said she was told by both a city and county official to remove the post because it was giving “False hope.”

Asked by Woodbury News Net when she first heard the Hudson Road rumor, Hemmingsen-Jaeger said she initially saw it on Reddit days before the Washington Post article was published. Clasen quickly added that the Post reporter did not know the specific location. Hemmingsen-Jaeger said she was not aware of any other rumored sites but added they would “Keep an eye out.”

“I do worry that if it doesn’t work here, they’ll just move on somewhere else, and that is a concern for me too. This doesn’t belong anywhere in any community in Minnesota,” Hemmingsen-Jaeger said.

Residents Fill City Hall

A child psychiatric practitioner, a high schooler, a father of three, a military mom, a resident who has lived in Woodbury for 30 years, a resident who has lived here for one, a Woodbury Planning Commission member, a social worker, a paramedic fire fighter. All walks of life, and nineteen more, approached the City Council on Wednesday night to address their concerns about ICE in the community they call home.

Woodbury’s public forum began at 7:55 p.m. and stretched to 9:04 p.m., exceeding its originally scheduled one-hour limit. Each speaker was given three minutes. All council members were physically present except Kim Wilson, who attended virtually.

The council chamber filled quickly, with residents lining hallways to watch on mounted televisions. An overflow room downstairs met capacity with more gathered outside.

Mayor Anne Burt opened the meeting by reiterating the statement she released earlier in the week confirming that the 11435 Hudson Road location would not be used as a federal detention facility. She adjusted ground rules for the unusually large crowd and spoke about the people, businesses and city staff who make up today’s Woodbury, along with the parks and trails that define the city.

Hemmingsen-Jaeger and Rep. Ethan Cha, also a DFL Party member representing House District 47B, were the first to address the council. Hemmingsen-Jaeger shared accounts she said she has heard from Woodbury residents about ICE activity and fear in the community.

“I am asking City Council to recognize that ICE is bad for public safety, it’s bad for business. It’s bad for our neighbors, and we want them out of Woodbury,” she said.

Cha then shared his family’s history, explaining that his father served the CIA during the war in Laos and that he arrived in the United States as a refugee before becoming a naturalized citizen in the 1990s.

“I’ve served this seat for the last three years, and I will tell you something, that the impact of the ICE presence and activities that has happened in Minnesota since ICE have been here, is an infringement on the American dream,” Cha said.

“We cannot afford to have ICE in our community, and we as a community of Woodbury, are not for sale,” he added.

Cha described fear among immigrant families that they would be deported, including his mother who now avoids grocery stores and public spaces. He said the community is looking to leadership at every level and that the mental health impact is already significant.

Woodbury resident John Phillips was the first non-government speaker to address the council, identifying himself as “Strongly opposed to an ICE facility.”

“The city’s response to this threat to date has been, frankly, inadequate,” Phillips said. “ICE didn’t choose Woodbury just because we’re next to a freeway and we have a big warehouse. They chose us because they see us as weak.”

Another resident, Ryan Ecklund, who has lived in Woodbury for 10 years, described encountering ICE vehicles earlier in the week and choosing to record them, which he said was constitutionally protected. He said he was later boxed in by ICE vehicles, detained and taken to the Whipple Federal Building before being released that evening after asserting his U.S. citizenship.

“By the end of that evening, there were eight other US citizens in the one cell that I was in, again, all of them US citizens unlawfully detained. What I see happening in our community is anxiety and fear, and I think everyone here shares that sentiment,” Ecklund said.

Rocio Foncea, a Woodbury resident since 2017 who immigrated to the United States in 2007, told the council ICE activity reminded her of life under dictatorship.

“I, as well as all the immigrants, work hard. We believe in humanity and the values of this country. This is why we are here,” Foncea said.

After 29 people spoke, council members responded. Council member Jennifer Santini said “I am unsure how to navigate out of the current status quo, because we are working outside legal norms” and encouraged residents to continue speaking up.

“Mr. Eklund is the one that said it about knowing your rights, and that is something I really want you all to be armed with,” Santini said. “I do believe that change is driven by people, so I urge you to continue raising these voices.”

Council member Steve Morris followed, asking residents to look around the room.

“The community is supporting you. The community is supporting each other. And this gives me hope,” Morris said.

“We may not have the power or authority to do everything that you want, but we are here, and we will tell you the truth,” he added.

Council member Donna Stafford said she was “overwhelmed” by the turnout and “almost brought to tears.” She encouraged residents to keep speaking through “kind community gatherings.”

“I grieve with everything going on in this country right now, it’s a very, very difficult time, but we’ve been through them before, and we in our little bubble of Woodbury, we’re going to make it happen because we are good, loving, caring people,” Stafford said.

Wilson spoke last, noting she is often the “odd man out.” She said she agreed “to some aspect” of her colleagues’ viewpoints and emphasized her long-standing support of public safety at every level of government.

“I have been a long supporter of public safety, not only at the local level, but at the county level, state level, and this will also go to the federal level,” Wilson said.

As she continued, her remarks were met with loud boos.

The population of the chamber was cut in half two minutes later.

Wilson closed by saying the city would remain transparent in its actions and that the federal government is above Woodbury.",https://woodburynewsnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CityCouncil011426-e1768468940282.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 18:58:49.168371

Chu.
In October, Rep. Chu helped prevent the deportation of Barbara Gomes Marques May, a Brazilian national with no criminal record, after a judge ruled in her favor.
In September, Rep. Chu also successfully advocated for the release of Rami Othmane, a Pasadena resident from Tunisia suffering from a brain tumor.
Rep. Chu has conducted multiple oversight visits to immigration detention facilities, even as federal officials have repeatedly and unlawfully attempted to block her access.
Rep. Chu has also attended more than a dozen rallies this past year to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with constituents calling for accountability from the Trump administration.","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Judy Chu (CA-28) has joined more than 70 of her House Democratic colleagues in cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem. Over the past year, Secretary Noem has executed Donald Trump’s violent immigration enforcement agenda that has torn families apart, undermined due process, and violated the most basic constitutional and human rights of people across the country. Last week, one of Secretary Noem’s ICE agents shot 37-year-old legal observer Renee Good in the face multiple times, killing her as she attempted to leave the scene.

“Under Secretary Noem’s leadership, ICE has descended into a lawless, violent force with zero accountability. Since day one, Secretary Noem’s ICE agents have terrorized our communities by driving around in unmarked vehicles, covering their faces, refusing to show ID, and recklessly detaining innocent people without due process. The cruelty we are witnessing is not normal, it is not justified, and it is not acceptable in a democracy,” said Rep. Chu. “In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot an American citizen in the face three times as she attempted to leave the scene. In California, ICE agents shot an innocent protestor with a non-lethal weapon, cracked his skull, and dragged him while he was bleeding, leaving him permanently blind in one eye. Secretary Noem is responsible for this violence. She must be held accountable for obstructing Congress, violating the public trust, and using her official position for personal gain. That is why I proudly join my Democratic colleagues in cosponsoring articles of impeachment against Secretary Noem, and I call for her immediate resignation.”

Despite the Trump administration’s cruel and harmful immigration policies, Rep. Chu has continued to use every tool at her disposal to fight back, demand accountability, and advocate for her constituents and immigrant communities in Southern California and across the country.

Last month, Rep. Chu intervened and successfully secured the release of Masuma Khan, who was detained during a routine immigration check despite nearly 30 years in the U.S. and no criminal record. In October, Rep. Chu helped prevent the deportation of Barbara Gomes Marques May, a Brazilian national with no criminal record, after a judge ruled in her favor. In September, Rep. Chu also successfully advocated for the release of Rami Othmane, a Pasadena resident from Tunisia suffering from a brain tumor.

Beyond individual cases, Rep. Chu has introduced and led major legislative and oversight efforts to hold ICE accountable and strengthen protections for immigrant communities, including:

H.R. 4667, Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act of 2025

This legislation would increase transparency and accountability by requiring immigration enforcement officers to clearly display visible identification during public enforcement actions, prohibiting non-medical face coverings, and requiring accountability when officers violate the law.

Demanding Oversight and Protections at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center

Following the deaths of Ismael Ayala-Uribe and Gabriel Garcia-Aviles at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, both of whom died after being denied timely and adequate medical care, Reps. Chu and Dave Min (CA-47) led 43 Members of Congress in a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE demanding accountability for ICE’s failure to meet basic medical standards, citing the record-high number of deaths in ICE custody that have occurred since Trump took office.

Rep. Chu has conducted multiple oversight visits to immigration detention facilities, even as federal officials have repeatedly and unlawfully attempted to block her access. During visits where she was granted entry, she witnessed deeply disturbing conditions and clear evidence of inhumane and unacceptable treatment of detainees. She will continue to conduct oversight and demand transparency, accountability, and compliance with the law.

Rep. Chu has also attended more than a dozen rallies this past year to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with constituents calling for accountability from the Trump administration.

“No one in this country should have to live in fear of their own government, all Americans and immigrant communities deserve dignity, due process, and protection under the law, and I will continue to fight back against policies that terrorize families in Southern California and across this country while demanding accountability from Donald Trump and those who carry out his agenda,” said Rep. Chu.",https://chu.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 17:57:55.590448

25-00255-3JP (“AGS”), provide some clues about how the trial court will endeavor to implement the Supreme Court’s decision once it is handed down.

The requested procedures largely reflected the CIT’s and parties’ experience in the mass China Section 301 tariff litigation, In Re Section 301 Cases, Ct. No.
The language in the AGS court’s order is highly relevant because with it, the CIT panel is signaling its intent to craft and implement structured case management procedures at a future date, after the SCOTUS decision.","We continue to watch closely for a pronouncement from the U.S. Supreme Court on the lawfulness of the fentanyl trafficking-related and global reciprocal tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) in the consolidated case of Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc. and Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump (“VOS Selections”). Meanwhile, recent interlocutory decisions by the Court of International Trade (CIT) in the consolidated case of AGS Co. Automotive Solutions v. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Ct. No. 25-00255-3JP (“AGS”), provide some clues about how the trial court will endeavor to implement the Supreme Court’s decision once it is handed down.

Filed in November 2025, after the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the VOS Selections case, AGS – and the many cases consolidated under that caption – involves claims by multiple U.S. importers similarly challenging the lawfulness of the IEEPA tariffs. Notably, AGS is pending before the same three-judge panel (Judges Katzmann, Reif, and Restani) that initially decided VOS Selections.

On January 14, 2026, the CIT denied the Government’s motion in AGS to adopt certain case management procedures. As the Government explained in its motion, ​“From October 2025 to the present, over 900 cases have been commenced challenging the IEEPA tariffs,” indicating that case management procedures such as automatic stays, a plaintiffs’ steering committee, a consolidated filing and service mechanism, and a universal stipulation on reliquidation would ease the burden of mass litigation. The requested procedures largely reflected the CIT’s and parties’ experience in the mass China Section 301 tariff litigation, In Re Section 301 Cases, Ct. No. 21-00052-3JP. The CIT panel in AGS declined to adopt the Government’s proposal, although it did so ​“without prejudice,” meaning that parties may file a similar request in the future should circumstances change.

In its paperless order denying the motion, the CIT made two critical statements:

The court confirmed ​“that the Government’s stipulation regarding reliquidation applies to all current and future similarly situated plaintiffs.” This refers to an earlier December 15, 2025, order in AGS in which the CIT denied the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive relief in the form of suspended liquidation of entries on which IEEPA tariffs had been assessed. The court concluded there is no irreparable harm to plaintiffs if the affected entries are allowed to liquidate because ​“where jurisdiction {under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)} has attached, this court has authority to order reliquidation, and the Plaintiffs cannot claim that they would be denied a refund of tariffs paid in the event that the challenged Executive Orders are ultimately deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court.” Importantly, the Government stipulated that it will not object to the court ordering reliquidation in the future if the IEEPA tariffs are found to be unlawful, and the CIT held the Government is judicially estopped from claiming otherwise after the Supreme Court decision issues.

Key Takeaway: Setting aside whether non-litigants (i.e., U.S. importers affected by the IEEPA tariffs that do not currently have cases pending before the CIT) will have to file lawsuits in the future to preserve refund rights, the CIT is reiterating that is has the legal authority, acknowledged by the Government, to order reliquidation of entries for purposes of issuing appropriate refunds.

Notably, the CIT’s reference to ​“future similarly situated plaintiffs” indicates that the court will hold the Government’s stipulation to apply to non-litigants that may be plaintiffs in the future – meaning that companies do not need to be current plaintiffs, already having filed a legal action invoking the court’s 1581(i) jurisdiction, to be eligible for an order of reliquidation if appropriate following the Supreme Court’s decision.

The court explained that it ​“will implement additional case management procedures as may be necessary following a final, unappealable decision in V.O.S.”

Key Takeaway: There has been wide speculation as to exactly what the mechanism will look like for affected importers to obtain refunds should the Supreme Court hold any aspect of the IEEPA tariffs to be unlawful. That could vary widely, from an administrative application process designed and driven by Customs and Border Protection (CBP), to a court-ordered application process, to an automatic refund mechanism, to litigation by individual importers. The path forward will likely depend on the nuances of the outcome in VOS Selections and how the Government (including CBP), current litigants, and CIT approach a solution, and if it is one that is universally applicable.

The language in the AGS court’s order is highly relevant because with it, the CIT panel is signaling its intent to craft and implement structured case management procedures at a future date, after the SCOTUS decision. While there is still significant uncertainty as to exactly what that will look like, it is now reasonable to expect the court will offer guidance and rules to thoughtfully address and manage litigation to the extent it is necessary – it will not be a ​“free for all” if the court can avoid it.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15522_2552.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:24.974313

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis on Thursday granted a motion from city and state attorneys who sought to reassign their case — which was slated to be heard by Judge Georgia Alexakis — to Ellis, given the case’s extensive similarities to another lawsuit in her courtroom brought by the Chicago Headline Club.

“Both of these cases involve many of the same issues of fact and law and they grow out of the same transaction or occurrence,” Ellis said at a hearing Thursday.

The new lawsuit includes broader claims than the Headline Club case, which largely centered on First Amendment violations by federal agents who deployed tear gas, pepper balls and other weapons against journalists and protesters during the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement operation.

The sweeping 103-page lawsuit claims that Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — who have conducted numerous aggressive raids in and around Chicago since “Midway Blitz” began in September — have acted as “occupiers” rather than law enforcement.

But the two cases do include many of the same use-of-force incidents, and Ellis on Thursday noted that she’s already spent “countless hours” holding hearings and reviewing videos and transcripts covering the same issues.

In the Chicago Headline Club case, Ellis issued an injunction that limited agents’ use of force. But that injunction was put on hold by an appeals court, and attorneys representing the plaintiffs in that case have since moved to voluntarily withdraw their lawsuit.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is named as a defendant in both lawsuits, previously slammed that injunction as an “extreme act” and labeled Ellis as an “activist judge.”

That process is not yet finalized, but the case could be withdrawn as soon as next week.

Peter Goldstone, an attorney for the federal government, argued that the two lawsuits are premised on significantly different theories, causes of action and legal bases, adding also that the cases themselves are at “diametrically opposite phases” of their litigation life cycle.

He said Thursday that state and city attorneys had not met their burden to move the case.

But Vikas Didwania, an attorney for the state of Illinois, said the two lawsuits featured significant overlap, as they both arose after federal agents “lawlessly ramapaged” through streets of Chicago.

He said that because Ellis is already intimately familiar with these incidents from “Operation Midway Blitz,” it would be a matter of improving “judicial economy” by reassigning the case to her courtroom.

Ellis agreed, over objections from the government.

“In other words,” she said, “the court is already up to speed on many of the facts and issues that will arise in the state and city case.”

Attorneys for the Chicago Headline Club did not oppose the motion to reassign the case. Ellis is expected to rule on their motion for voluntary dismissal at a Jan. 22 hearing.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:29.343562

While this raises the possibility that the tariffs could ultimately be invalidated, a business’s right to a refund would not be automatic. Businesses affected by the tariffs may therefore wish to consider steps to preserve their ability to recover import duties paid if the tariffs are struck down.

The Supreme Court Case & Related Litigation

The Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, with the Justices expressing skepticism over the legality of the tariffs. Even if the Court ultimately strikes down the tariffs, businesses may not be entitled to an automatic refund for import duties already paid.

Multiple businesses have now filed follow-on lawsuits in the Court of International Trade to protect their rights in the event the Supreme Court invalidates the IEEPA tariffs. These lawsuits follow the existing challenge in V.O.S. Selections and related challenges involving tariffs imposed on goods from countries such as India and Brazil.

How Import Duties Are Finalized

When a business imports goods into the United States, the importer pays an estimated duty on entry based on its customs declaration. Customs and Border Protection reviews and finalizes the entry, notifying the importer of record whether additional duties are owed or whether the importer is entitled to a refund. This process, known as liquidation, must generally occur within one year, although Customs and Border Protection typically seeks to liquidate duties approximately 314 days after the date of entry.

Why Liquidation Matters

If an importer protests the amount paid, it must do so within 180 days, asking Customs and Border Protection to “reliquidate” the duties. However, there are some circumstances in which a business cannot protest an entry’s liquidation, such as when Customs and Border Protection acts in a purely ministerial capacity (i.e., without discretion). The risk of liquidation is the basis for recent lawsuits filed in the Court of International Trade, as companies seek to enjoin the federal government from imposing and enforcing any tariffs under the IEEPA and to recover any duties paid on the allegedly unlawful tariffs.

In recent filings, the Government has indicated that it is willing to treat similarly situated plaintiffs in similar ways, but that approach may require a proper challenge filed in court to prevent liquidation or to obtain an order requiring reliquidation.

Important Considerations for Businesses

Businesses that have paid import duties on challenged tariffs should consult with a lawyer, as even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, refunds may not be automatic, and importers may lack the ability to recover duties on already-liquidated entries if no action is taken.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15560_510.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:34.137083

Evaluating ICE protests solely as a crisis occurring within U.S. borders obscures the structural conditions that give rise to migration.
ICE protests have also brought the issue of institutional accountability back onto the agenda.","Protests directed against the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may appear, on the surface, to be a debate over immigration policy. In reality, however, they carry a far deeper political and international significance. These protests are not merely objections concerning the status of undocumented migrants. They constitute part of a broader struggle over the relationship between security and the state, human rights norms and America’s claim to global leadership. Rather than viewing these protests solely as reactions confined to U.S. domestic politics, they should also be read as symptoms reflecting the transformation of the global order.

As the second Trump administration approaches the end of its first year, it is evident that collective anxiety, fear and frustration regarding the increasingly authoritarian trajectory of Washington are intensifying.

Foundations of protests

At the core of the protests lies the question of how rights are defined. The primary dynamic here consists of allegations of human rights violations. Conditions in detention centers, the separation of children from their families and limited access to legal procedures create an explicit contradiction with the liberal norms that the U.S. itself claims to uphold. Yet criticism of ICE practices is directed not only at the severity of procedures but also at the linkage of rights to citizenship status. The exclusion of migrants from full legal processes produces a practice that effectively suspends the idea of the universality of rights.

The second fundamental dynamic is the politicization of identity. The concentration of ICE practices on specific ethnic and geographical groups transforms immigration policy from a technical security issue into a debate over social hierarchy. Inequalities based on race, ethnicity and class are reproduced through the immigration regime. Although the protesters’ reaction is directed at a specific institution, it is, in essence, a response to the state’s systematic coding of certain bodies as permanently ""suspect,” ""temporary” or ""undesirable.”

The third, and often overlooked, dimension concerns the global origins of inequality. Evaluating ICE protests solely as a crisis occurring within U.S. borders obscures the structural conditions that give rise to migration. A significant portion of migrants are on the move due to factors such as instability, economic deprivation and violence – factors that are often the product of global power relations, interventionist policies and unjust economic orders. The protests question a security-centered approach that focuses only on the final link of this chain. Viewed more deeply, it is not difficult to recognize that these protests also reflect a reaction to the U.S.’ globally interventionist and destabilizing policies. The emphasis on Venezuela and Iran by certain groups stems precisely from this perspective.

Democracy under stress

One of the most visible effects of this process is the questioning of the extent to which the expansion of state authority justified by security concerns aligns with social consent. Reactions to ICE practices are directed not only at deportation or detention itself but also at the political logic through which these practices are legitimized. The more dominant security discourse becomes in the public sphere, the stronger the perception that democratic oversight mechanisms are being weakened.

Another critical dimension for democracy is the renewed debate over freedom of expression. Anti-ICE demonstrations render visible both the boundaries of the right to protest and the state’s approach to this right. In some cases, harsh police interventions or the criminalization of protests undermine society’s sense of security while simultaneously forcing the system to reassert its legitimacy.

In this context, tensions between the federal structure and local governments acquire particular significance. ""Sanctuary city” practices have raised the question of whether immigration policy should be treated as a centralized security issue or as part of local social order. Officials in the states of Minnesota and Illinois filed two separate lawsuits in federal court against the federal government, arguing that the deployment of thousands of immigration officers in metropolitan areas violated states’ rights under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The Tenth Amendment reserves to the states the right to protect the health, safety and welfare of their residents. This challenge, pursued both through protest and legal channels, also reveals the flexibility and multilayered nature of American federalism. The protests serve as a reminder that this multilayered structure constitutes not a site of conflict, but a space for negotiation.

ICE protests have also brought the issue of institutional accountability back onto the agenda. Reports concerning detention centers, problems of access to judicial processes, and the lack of transparency raise serious questions regarding oversight of the executive branch. The protests remind both the legislative and judicial branches of their roles in this area, emphasizing that the separation of powers is not merely a constitutional principle but a living political practice. Moreover, the U.S. government’s failure to effectively oversee the actions of ICE agents and the arbitrariness of enforcement practices have led courts to abandon the presumption of accuracy traditionally granted to government-provided information.

Erosion of normative power

The most enduring impact of protests against ICE is observed not only in the domestic political balance of the U.S. but also in the erosion of its legitimacy at the global level. If the U.S. has long been able to exert influence beyond its military and economic capacity, this has largely stemmed from its ability to present its own values as universal norms. However, harsh practices surrounding the immigration regime and the protests they have triggered are increasingly calling this normative claim into question.

One of the fundamental pillars of U.S. foreign policy has been the relative consistency between principles defended domestically and behaviors demanded internationally. Human rights, the rule of law and individual freedoms occupy a central place in this discourse. Yet debates surrounding ICE practices reinforce the perception that the U.S. applies these principles conditionally, even within its own borders. As protests render this conditionality visible, the U.S. capacity to function as a global ""model” correspondingly weakens.

This weakening manifests not so much as a loss of power in the classical sense, but as an erosion of the ability to persuade. States are effective not only through coercive means but also to the extent that they can generate the consent of others. The international resonance of ICE protests demonstrates that U.S. criticism of other countries on migration and human rights issues is no longer perceived as convincing as it once was. Concerns are growing that regimes exhibiting authoritarian tendencies may exploit these contradictions in the U.S. to legitimize their own practices.

When the contribution of U.S. economic, political and at times military interventions to the structural conditions driving migration is recalled, harsh border policies are perceived not merely as security measures but as an evasion of responsibility. This perception quietly yet profoundly erodes the U.S. claim to regional leadership. To compensate for this erosion, Washington may feel compelled to demonstrate even greater power, potentially including the use of force.

For this reason, the ""erosion of normative power” should be treated not as a temporary image problem but as a strategic issue.

Court records indicate Jose Yugar-Cruz, 36, entered the United States in July 2024 after fleeing his home country of Bolivia. In court filings, Yugar-Cruz alleged that while living in Bolivia, he operated a small business and had “refused to facilitate the drug trade by police officials” who then detained him and tortured him.

In the court filings, Yugar-Cruz said he fled to Mexico, entered the United States on foot at the Arizona border, and then “sought out and surrendered” himself to federal immigration officials. He was then taken into custody and jailed, after which he applied for asylum based on the threat of persecution in Bolivia.

In December 2024, a federal immigration judge held a hearing on Yugar-Cruz’s asylum request. According to a lawsuit Yugar-Cruz filed four weeks ago against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and various Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, the judge ruled in January 2025 that the U.S. government could not send Yugar-Cruz back to Bolivia due to the ongoing threat of torture.

The judge granted Yugar-Cruz “withholding-of-removal relief” — a form of protection for individuals who face persecution if returned to their home country. It prevents the U.S. government from deporting an individual to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened.

In his lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz asserted the government never appealed the immigration judge’s ruling and so he “expected that he would soon be released from detention and allowed to start his life in the United States.”

In February 2025, however, Yugar-Cruz was still being held in the Freeborn County Adult Detention Center in Albert Lea, Minn. While there, the lawsuit claimed, he spoke to ICE officials who first indicated he’d be released in “15 days or so,” but later informed him they would continue to hold him while looking for some third-party country to which he could be deported.

The lawsuit alleged ICE officials proposed that Yugar-Cruz be deported to Argentina, Chile or Paraguay, all of which border Bolivia, but Yugar-Cruz objected, noting that Bolivians, including the police, can easily travel to those countries without a passport. Mexico was proposed as an alternative, but Yugar-Cruz expressed concern officials there would simply deport him to Bolivia.

Lawsuit cites Trump policy on deportations

On Dec. 3, 2025, Yugar-Cruz was transferred from the Albert Lea jail to the Muscatine County Jail in Iowa.

Nine days later, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney sued the Muscatine County jail administrator, as well as Noem and other Homeland Security officials, alleging they were violating federal law by continuing to detain Yugar-Cruz 11 months after the immigration judge had ruled in his favor.

As part of that lawsuit, Yugar-Cruz’s attorney noted the Trump administration had adopted a practice of deporting people to third-party countries with no guarantee those individuals wouldn’t immediately be sent to their home country, where they faced persecution or torture.

A federal judge in the District of Columbia has ruled the practice amounts to a “widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.”

In recent months, the administration has deported at least 20 individuals to Eswatini and other African nations where they’ve reportedly been jailed indefinitely at maximum-security prisons without charges and without access to legal counsel.

None of the individuals originated from those African countries. They had been convicted of crimes in the United States, but had served their sentences and were released before being detained by ICE and then deported over the objections of human rights organizations.

Yugar-Cruz has no criminal record, according to his attorney’s court filings. His lawsuit alleged violations of his due process rights and the Immigration Nationality Act, and sought his immediate release from the Muscatine County Jail.

Recently, after the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged the federal government had been attempting, without success, to find a third-party country to accept Yugar-Cruz, District Court Judge Stephen H. Locher ruled in Yugar-Cruz’s favor.

Locher ordered the Muscatine County Jail to work with ICE officials in securing Yugar-Cruz’s immediate release and, on Jan. 7, 2026, ICE officials confirmed for the court that Yugar-Cruz had been discharged from the county jail.

His release remains subject to “reasonable conditions of supervision” by ICE, according to Locher’s order.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gavel-scales-book-_-Witthaya-Prasongsin-Getty-RF-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:35.211200

It designates high-ranking city staff as the authority to tell federal agents to leave city property, and if that doesn’t work to call the police.
The Bend Park & Recreation District updated its ICE policy in August, instructing staff to not assist or allow officers to enter buildings.
The city’s policy comes amid skyrocketing tensions between the public and federal immigration agents.
Catalina Frank, executive director of the Latino Community Association, told the Bend City City Council in a presentation last week there have been at least 16 confirmed deportations in the Central Oregon region since January 2025.","The city of Bend drafted a new policy outlining its pushback to federal immigration officers should they attempt to make arrests or stage operations on city property.

The policy, set to be adopted by the city manager’s office in the coming days, condemns what the city calls “indiscriminate and increasingly violent, and likely unlawful” civil immigration enforcement tactics taking place in Oregon and across the country. It designates high-ranking city staff as the authority to tell federal agents to leave city property, and if that doesn’t work to call the police.

The policy essentially clarifies how Bend would comply with Oregon sanctuary laws in the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Bend City Attorney Ian Leitheiser said during a Wednesday meeting of the city’s Human Rights and Equity Commission. State law prohibits local jurisdictions from participating in ICE operations, including “ investigating, detecting, apprehending, arresting, detaining or holding individuals.”

“We can’t stop an ICE agent from using a parking lot that’s available for the public to park their car, but we can stop them from using that parking lot for staging, operating, doing other things related to immigration enforcement,” Leitheiser said.

The city’s real estate director, Matt Stuart, is one of the staff who could be tasked with confronting ICE, along with the city manager or potentially a department head. Stuart said he would approach officers and “let them know what state law says, what our policy says, and if they don’t want to comply, we’ll be contacting our local law enforcement.”

Stuart says there are relatively few city properties where immigration enforcement is likely to occur, but those could include parking lots or lobbies at city hall or the public works campus.

The Bend Park & Recreation District updated its ICE policy in August, instructing staff to not assist or allow officers to enter buildings.

The city’s policy comes amid skyrocketing tensions between the public and federal immigration agents. Federal agents recently shot four people in three separate incidents in the span of a week: the killing of U.S. Citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, the shooting of two Venezuelan immigrants in Portland a day later and Wednesday’s shooting of a Venezuelan man in Minneapolis. The federal government has said officers were acting in self-defense.

The violence sparked protests across the country, including in Bend.

“With the way we are witnessing federal immigration officers terrorizing communities and not following the law, it’s important for us to be clear about what our policy is,” Kebler said in an interview on Thursday morning.

The number of people in immigration detention has hit record highs under President Donald Trump. Catalina Frank, executive director of the Latino Community Association, told the Bend City City Council in a presentation last week there have been at least 16 confirmed deportations in the Central Oregon region since January 2025. Frank described reports of “forceful tactics” from other parts of the state, including break-ins and racial profiling, while mentioning the first shooting in Minneapolis.

“The reality is that while we don’t know when these operations will reach Central Oregon, all signs indicate that they will,” Frank said.

The nonprofit asked the city for funding and support to help people who are fearful of deportations and ICE activity in Central Oregon. Frank asked Bend to join other cities across Oregon in declaring a state of emergency over heightened immigration enforcement.

Kebler said the city council will discuss the topic at its next meeting, and either declare an emergency or draft some kind of support resolution.

Agatha Ventura, a staff member at Central Oregon Community College and chair of the city’s Human Rights and Equity Commission, said she’s encouraged by the city’s commitment to sanctuary law, but also hopes for more support in the case that ICE should detain someone illegally.

“I don’t think any of us are safe at this stage,” Ventura said. “I hope our leadership is also planning for when other measures have to be taken and how people will be supported, the practical ways people can be supported in worst case scenarios.”",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/cf9aa97bf9e104eaf2d7d761f0895fa2-copy.jpg?w=640,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:39.617168

President Donald Trump, on the first day of his second term, issued an executive order instructing federal agencies to recognize only a person's sex assigned at birth. It disregarded the concept of gender identity as a ""false claim,"" dismissing the self-identification of any individual who does not conform to the administration's definition of sex.

The administration now says states and other entities that don't comply with that executive order will be ineligible for billions of dollars in federal grant funding allocated through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for health education in public schools, medical research and workforce development programs that train medical professionals on topics including rural health, addiction treatment and senior health.

Illinois, for example, allows its residents to change the sex on their birth certificate by signing a statement affirming their gender designation or intersex condition.

In their lawsuit, the states called the latest Trump directive ""a novel and ambiguous funding condition.""

""The Trump administration is attempting to hold billions of dollars hostage in an attempt to force states to exclude and discriminate against people who are transgender,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. ""Everyone deserves to live authentically, and I will continue to push back against the administration's repeated and cruel attempts to erase transgender Americans.""

Trump's order further directed federal agencies to remove all statements and policies that were inclusive of other gender identities and to take all necessary and legally permissible steps to end funding that promotes alternate definitions of sex and gender.

In their lawsuit, the states alleged the administration's purpose was ""to exclude transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-diverse individuals and make denial of their existence official policy.""

Title IX

HHS has long required states to certify compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the landmark civil rights law passed to prevent sex discrimination in federally funded education programs, including in sports.

The new condition, however, compels states to adhere not only to Title IX requirements, but also to the Trump order. States argued HHS does not have the authority to impose new requirements on congressionally allocated spending.

""Congress has funded these programs without any requirement to exclude entities that recognize transgender, nonbinary, intersex or gender diverse individuals,"" the states wrote.

The states argued that, due to the vagueness of the order, HHS's new condition would also potentially open them up to civil and criminal liability under the False Claims Act, a federal statute that makes it illegal to knowingly present a false or fraudulent claim when applying for federal funds. Even if they wanted to comply, states said, there are not clear guidelines to do so.

The order, states argued, is inconsistent with other official HHS policies. The website for HHS's own Office for Civil Rights as of Wednesday afternoon outlined past Supreme Court decisions which established precedent for the prohibition of discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

""OCR will interpret Section 1557's prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex to include: (1) discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; and (2) discrimination on the basis of gender identity,"" the website states.

Compliance with the federal order would also put Illinois in violation of the state's Human Rights Act, which provides protections against gender-based discrimination in employment, housing and schools.

The states have asked the court to find the HHS policy unlawful and block its enforcement.

A pattern of threats

The administration has made a pattern of threatening to withhold funds to punish Democrat-led states like Illinois that do not fall in line with federal policies on issues from gender-affirming care to immigration protections.

Illinois joined a separate multi-state lawsuit in August seeking to block Trump's executive orders that prohibited gender-affirming care for young people, and another in December that threatened Medicaid and Medicare funding for hospitals providing the care.

It further directed federal agencies to remove all statements and policies that were inclusive of other gender identities and to take all necessary and legally permissible steps to end funding that promotes alternate definitions of sex and gender.

The order's purpose, the states alleged, ""is to exclude transgender, intersex, non-binary and gender-diverse individuals and make denial of their existence official policy.""

Raoul has won other similar suits against the Trump administration, including over a Trump order which directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to withhold federal emergency funding from Illinois over the state's immigration laws. A judge ruled in September that it was unconstitutional for federal agencies to withhold disaster relief funding simply because a state's laws differ from federal ones.

This week, the state sued the feds alleging that their aggressive immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago region is part of an ""organized bombardment"" of the state aimed at forcing capitulation on immigration policies.

The December lawsuit challenging the administration's regulations on Medicare and Medicaid put implementation of the policy on hold, at least until mid-April while the case is ongoing.

The administration has demonstrated, though, that it will not hesitate to pull funds.

Late Tuesday night, the administration cut an estimated $2 billion in funding nationwide for nonprofit groups that provide health services to people experiencing addiction, homelessness and mental health challenges.

A letter announcing the change said federal officials ""no longer believe the defunded programs align with the Trump administration's priorities,"" according to NPR.

Four of the House members responded with a joint statement accusing Trump of deploying the bureau “as a tool to intimidate and harass” the lawmakers.","Three House Democrats confirmed on Wednesday they have been approached by federal prosecutors investigating their participation in a November video about military duty, widening the circle of legislators being targeted by the Trump administration.

Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania disclosed that the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, led by Jeanine Pirro, had requested interviews about the 90-second video in which they said troops don’t need to comply with illegal orders.

“Donald Trump called for my arrest, prosecution, and execution – all because I said something he didn’t like,” Crow said in a statement. “Now he’s pressuring his political appointees to harass me for daring to speak up and hold him accountable. I won’t be intimidated and will keep fighting to uphold my oath to the Constitution and defend our country.”

Goodlander framed the government’s response as alarming and instructive.

“No matter the threats, I am not backing down,” she said in a video posted on X. “It is sad, telling and downright dangerous that simply stating a bedrock principle of American law caused the president, our commander in chief, to threaten violence against me, and to weaponize the Department of Justice.”

Goodlander added that she once served in the Department of Justice and she knew “that federal prosecutors have more control over the life and liberty of the American people than any other peacetime force”.

The announcements bring the number of lawmakers who have publicly confirmed contact with federal prosecutors to five, after the Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin’s revelation on Tuesday that she was under investigation. The Pentagon secretary, Pete Hegseth, formally censured the Arizona senator Mark Kelly, a retired navy captain, in January and launched administrative proceedings that could result in rank reduction and pension cuts. Kelly has responded with litigation, arguing the Pentagon’s actions violate constitutional protections.

The video in question featured six Democratic lawmakers, each of whom previously served in the military, CIA or naval intelligence. In it, they reminded service members of their duty under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disobey illegal commands – a principle regularly taught in military training.

Trump said the message was “seditious” and floated the possibility of capital punishment, though he subsequently walked back the death penalty reference while insisting the lawmakers remained in serious jeopardy. Everyone in the video – which also included the Pennsylvania representative Chris Deluzio – have now been contacted by either the FBI or federal prosecutors regarding their message to service members.

“By sending the FBI and now DoJ after Rep Deluzio and the other members of Congress who stated the law in a recent video, it’s obvious that this administration is engaged in a harassment campaign against their political rivals,” Deluzio spokesperson Zoe Bluffstone said. “Congressman Deluzio won’t be intimidated and will keep doing the job he was elected to do.”

Houlahan suggested the investigation’s true motivation was stifling political speech. “The six of us are being targeted not because we said something untrue, but because we said something President Trump and Secretary Hegseth didn’t want anyone to hear,” she told NBC News in a statement.

The federal targeting represents an extraordinary use of prosecutorial power against sitting legislators for protected political speech. According to Crow’s office, Pirro’s office reached out last week seeking an interview about the video.

Government watchdog groups have condemned the investigations as authoritarian overreach. David Janovsky, acting director of the constitution project at the project on government oversight, described the prosecutions as an assault on constitutional principles. “A sitting president attempting to prosecute his political opponents just for saying something he disagrees with is a hallmark of authoritarianism,” he said in a statement.

But three times, ICE documented a suspect’s body, described as “hands/feet/body,” as a weapon.
Meanwhile, Minnesota governor Tim Walz encouraged residents to use the tools available to them to hold ICE agents accountable.
An FBI investigation into an ICE agent shooting a driver pulling away from a parking spot has been slow-walked in the past.","When Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Nicole Good last Wednesday morning in Minneapolis, the 37-year-old mother became one of at least 25 people killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shooting since 2015.

In the days after Ross fired at Good multiple times from the front and side of Good’s car, visual investigations from outlets like The New York Times and The Washington Post have reconstructed the event, which unfolded in a matter of seconds, combing through a series of videos that emerged from various angles. These present apparent contradictions between the narrative presented by the White House and Department of Homeland Security, which claims Ross acted in self-defense, and what actually happened.

But similar contradictions haven’t previously led to criminal indictments in ICE agent shootings. In fact, there does not appear to have ever been a criminal indictment stemming from an ICE shooting at all.

I spent four years investigating ICE shootings that occurred from 2015 to 2021, over the course of three presidential administrations. I sued ICE for the logs of all of these shootings—a lawsuit that took two years to be settled—and cross-analyzed them with media reports, lawsuits, over 40 interviews with experts, shooting victims, families, and lawyers, and 20 other Freedom of Information Act requests for law enforcement investigation reports across the United States to piece together what happened and what patterns they revealed.

Not counting the Good shooting, ICE agent shootings have involved moving vehicles at least 19 times—which are connected to at least 10 deaths and six injuries. Task forces including ICE agents have shot at least three other US citizens. They have shot in public areas with bystanders 22 times. And in at least seven cases, the person shot by an ICE officer was not the target of the enforcement action.

The Same Defense

The self-defense claim ICE, its agents, or their lawyers have made after shootings has historically been proven impossible to refute. An agent using deadly force does so justifiably when it is “objectively reasonable and necessary,” ICE spokesperson Mike Alvarez told me in an email in 2024.

“A law enforcement officer placing himself or herself in front of a motor vehicle to prevent a suspect's potential avenue of escape is a dangerous tactic and a potential violation of policy,” Mike German, a former federal law enforcement agent, tells WIRED. “But I don't think that would be likely to impact a prosecutor's evaluation of whether the officer has a reasonable fear at the time he pulled the trigger that he was in a life-threatening situation justifying deadly force.”

This reasonableness standard is what a city, state, or federal agency would assess when deciding whether to indict an agent for any criminal activity, and it’s evaluated from the perspective of a law enforcement official, not a layperson, German explains.

“Prosecutors and judges tend to be very deferential to law enforcement agents involved in shootings,” German says. “Typically, an agent's subjective belief that deadly force was necessary to protect themselves, or the safety of another person, from serious bodily harm is enough to avoid criminal charges, or conviction if charged.”

Sometimes suspects were seen to have guns, according to the ICE logs I obtained, particularly in the course of Homeland Security Investigations. But three times, ICE documented a suspect’s body, described as “hands/feet/body,” as a weapon.

And in at least a dozen cases, I uncovered evidence suggesting that the shooting victims were unarmed.

Federal agent-involved shooting investigations conducted by the Justice Department rarely result in criminal charges, and the results are rarely released publicly, German says. “The bottom line is that these shooting investigations very rarely find the agent in violation of law or policy.”

Besides self-defense, ICE agents, like all federal agents, are largely protected by qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects them from civil lawsuits for constitutional violations committed in the course of the duty. In recent years, two Supreme Court cases involving an immigration agent shooting and physical injury, Mesa v. Hernandez (2020) and Egbert v. Boule (2022), further cemented any private citizen’s inability to sue federal agents for harm.

The All-Clear

Determining whether criminal charges are warranted is the responsibility of a state or local law enforcement agency—most often the state attorney general’s office—and/or from a federal agency investigating, like the FBI. Both federal and municipal bodies can prosecute separately, at the same time, according to their own policies, and do not have to defer to one another.

But on Thursday, just one day after Ross shot Good, Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) “reluctantly” withdrew from the joint investigation with the FBI after the US Attorney’s Office said the FBI would be the sole investigator and would no longer grant the BCA access to the case materials, scene evidence, or investigative interviews.

The US attorney general pushing the BCA out of the joint investigation, though, doesn’t prevent the Minnesota Attorney General or the Hennepin County Attorney’s office from conducting their own homicide investigation.

In a press conference on January 9, both offices asked residents and witnesses to submit evidence in the Hennepin County Attorney evidence submission portal. The county attorney, Mary Moriarty, said the office has received hundreds of calls and emails to open an independent investigation. Across its social pages, the county attorney’s office didn’t confirm that it would do that and instead said the office “stands ready” to assist the FBI.

Meanwhile, Minnesota governor Tim Walz encouraged residents to use the tools available to them to hold ICE agents accountable. “So carry your phone with you at all times. And if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take that phone out and record,” Walz said in Wednesday’s address. “Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans—not just to establish a record for posterity but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

The Hennepin County Attorney’s office didn’t respond to an email asking whether it plans to open an investigation.

Local agencies backing out has precedent. There have been shootings in the past that may have gone uninvestigated due to alleged confusion on jurisdiction between state and federal agencies.

In a February 2018 shooting in Dumfries, Virginia, an ICE agent who was a member of a US Marshals fugitive task force killed an unarmed man by shooting him in the back as he was fleeing arrest. The commonwealth’s attorney’s office began to investigate but stopped before it finished, saying it lacked jurisdiction over federal agents. But even though it didn’t weigh in on an indictment, the office wrote in an opinion that the federal agent enjoyed immunity from state prosecution.

Like in Minneapolis last week, the case was solely in the FBI’s hands, and the commonwealth’s attorney’s office confirmed that it gave the bureau its collected investigative material. But the FBI neither confirmed nor denied my query about whether that investigation took place.

An FBI investigation into an ICE agent shooting a driver pulling away from a parking spot has been slow-walked in the past.

In September 2019 in Nashville, Tennessee, a deportation agent shot at a man through the window of his truck twice as he pulled out of a grocery store parking lot at around 7 am local time. An ICE spokesperson told reporters the man behind the wheel drove toward the agents. But video footage obtained by a local TV station showed that the truck was parked when the ICE agents drove up and that the agent raised his hand—presumably with a gun—and chased the truck pulling away. The FBI was tasked with investigating the ICE’s agent’s allegation that the driver assaulted him. The driver, who surrendered to the FBI and was later arrested by ICE, was later released from custody.

The results of the inquiry by the FBI, the sole investigating agency in the case, were never made public.

“The problem is that these federal shooting investigations often take a long, long time and are rarely publicly reported when they conclude, so the passage of time dampens the public demand for accountability,” German, the former federal law enforcement agent says.

State and local law enforcement agencies have consistently cleared agents of wrongdoing after shootings even when they have hindered investigations, which happened three times across Arizona and California between 2015 and 2021.

In 2018 in Scottsdale, Arizona, an ICE investigator shot a man multiple times—the last bullet was fired after the man was already on the ground—and the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office found that he disregarded protocol by not remaining on the scene to give a statement. (He eventually gave one six days later.) That he fired his gun violated other protocols, and prosecutors found that his conduct could “justify further investigatory steps” but still cleared him.

In 2016 in Chula Vista, California, an ICE agent advised a colleague who killed a 22-year-old by shooting him four times within 10 seconds not to cooperate with the investigation, according to a transcript of the body-wire recording obtained by the victim’s family and published as part of a lawsuit. “Don’t worry about it,” he told him. “Remember … no statements. None of that shit.”

The lawyer who represented the family in a lawsuit that was dismissed said the agents were questioned, but the Chula Vista Police Department report did not include any details of the investigation. The agents’ lawyers did not respond to WIRED’s queries about the case.

Out of Sight

If an incident is potentially criminal, the DHS Inspector General’s Office might review it. But ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility will always investigate a shooting for policy violations, and, lacking authority to issue discipline, will make disciplinary recommendations if it deems them necessary, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Report looking into DHS use-of-force policies.

Any suggestion on disciplinary measures goes back to the agent’s supervisor, who can decide whether to administer it. And even when disciplinary action is applied, an ICE officer can appeal that decision. It can take years for discipline to actually be issued, if it ever is.

Gretta Goodwin, the author of the GAO report, found that ICE’s data collection lacked any path forward for review. In some use-of-force reviews, she said in an interview in 2023, ICE documented incidents but didn’t document whether they were in accordance with policy.

“They wrote it down, but as far as we know they did no follow up,” Goodwin said.

As for the outcome, Goodwin said she saw some disciplinary actions but didn’t learn the frequency of them.

“We did see that people were reprimanded, suspended,” she said. “I don’t know if anyone got fired.”

The GAO reviewed the DHS use-of-force practices in 2023 as part of a 2022 Executive Order on police reform for federal law enforcement bodies.

For more than a decade, ICE agents operated under an interim use-of-force policy from 2004, which the DHS Inspector General’s Office said was outdated and didn’t incorporate lessons learned since its establishment.

ICE confirmed that it had created a new use-of-firearms and use-of-force policy in 2023, which appear to be the most recent guidelines, following the executive order. But it refused to release it when I had requested it in 2024, telling me in an email that the policies had “not been published for public view.” ICE later published it with everything except the “purpose” redacted.

Like its use-of-force policies, the results of ICE’s internal investigations are not made public.

ICE did not respond to queries about whether the policy has since been updated, nor to release an unredacted version, nor to confirm the number of deaths by shootings.

Presidential Protection

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem said Good was involved in an act of “domestic terrorism,” but J. Wells Dixon, a senior attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, calls the claim “baseless” and believes that this allegation doesn’t hold any weight in an investigation or prosecution.

“The Constitution applies to and constrains the application of all state and federal criminal statutes,” Dixon tells WIRED.

Dixon is of the opinion that “Secretary Noem obviously lied when she claimed Renee Good was a ‘domestic terrorist’ in order to denigrate her and suggest—falsely—that she somehow deserved to be murdered by a masked ICE agent.”

Plans to shield ICE agents are ongoing in the Trump administration. According to recent reporting by Zeteo, President Trump had instructed officials in his administration as early as last year to protect ICE agents, including 12,000 new recruits, accused of crimes.

During a White House press briefing on January 8, Vice President JD Vance said agents have “absolute immunity,” a new term with no legal background.","https://media.wired.com/photos/696120e39c539b8af2cca8f5/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/sec-ice-murderers-2254509191.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 17:58:14.247984

However, the tool allegedly mistakenly flagged applicants as qualified based on resume keywords such as “officer,” misidentifying titles like “compliance officer” or those expressing an aspiration to join ICE as equivalent to prior law enforcement experience.

As a result, officials said many applicants were routed into the shorter online training program without meeting the necessary background requirements. It remains unclear how many were improperly trained or deployed before the mistake was caught.

The issue was identified in mid-fall, more than a month into ICE’s accelerated hiring push. ICE has since implemented manual resume reviews and recalled affected recruits to FLETC for proper training, according to the officials, who spoke anonymously due to not being authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

The hiring surge, backed by funding from the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” included $50,000 signing bonuses and was intended to meet a congressional mandate to add 10,000 new ICE officers by the end of 2025.

Wednesday morning, the court released its opinions in three argued cases: Bost v. Illinois State Board of Elections, Case v. Montana, and Barrett v. United States.

In Bost, the court held that, as a candidate for office, Congressman Michael Bost has standing to challenge Illinois’ rules for counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.

In Case, the court held that police officers in Montana did not violate the Fourth Amendment when they entered a home without a warrant and without “probable cause” because they reasonably believed that someone in the house needed emergency assistance.

In Barrett, the court held that defendants who violate two separate provisions of the Armed Career Criminal Act cannot be convicted under both for the same crime.

Morning Reads

Parents Ask Supreme Court to Restore Ruling on Gender Disclosure (Mark Walsh, Education Week) — A group of California parents has asked the Supreme Court to intervene after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit blocked “a federal district court decision that said parents have a federal constitutional right to be informed by schools of any gender nonconformity and social transition by their children,” according to Education Week. The 9th Circuit panel said that the district court’s decision was “too ‘sweeping’ and ‘ambiguous’ and likely wrong on the merits,” and the panel “reinstated a mandate by the California Department of Education that restrains teachers and district staff members from informing parents about a child’s gender identity at school, unless the child consents.”

Louisiana Indicts Another Out-of-State Doctor Over Abortion Pills (Emily Cochrane and Pam Belluck, The New York Times)(Paywall) — As part of their broader push to limit abortion in the state, “Louisiana officials on Tuesday moved to extradite a California doctor the state indicted on a charge of providing abortion pills to a Louisiana resident,” according to The New York Times. Cases like these over abortion pill prescriptions are part of a new wave of legal battles over abortion that emerged after “the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the national right to abortion in 2022.” Legal experts expect that the court may soon need to address “whether states are required to honor one another’s abortion laws.”

‘When did I do that?’ Trump says about $2,000 tariff dividend checks (Mike Snider, USA Today) — During a recent interview with The New York Times, President Donald Trump appeared surprised to be asked about his previous comments on sending $2,000 tariff dividend checks to American families, according to USA Today. Since July, Trump has repeatedly pitched sending such checks out by mid-2026, but he now says his administration would need more time than that. “I’ll be able to do $2,000 sometime. I would say toward the end of the year,” the president said. According to the interview transcript, Trump also said that he plans to impose new tariffs through “some other alternative” if the Supreme Court strikes down the current tariffs.

No, ICE Agents Do Not Have ‘Absolute Immunity’ From State Prosecution (Damon Root, Reason) — In a column for Reason, Damon Root responded to Vice President J.D. Vance’s recent claim that “the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer who shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis cannot be prosecuted for it by Minnesota officials” because, as a federal law enforcement officer engaged in federal action, he is protected by “absolute immunity.” According to Root, “the precedent is not actually so simple.” In a 1906 case called Drury v. Lewis, the court rejected “a Vance-like argument that called for shielding” officers “from any and all state prosecution,” holding that courts can review disputes “over lawful versus unlawful use of force.”

How the Supreme Court May Untangle the Tariff Knot (Dan McLaughlin, National Review)(Paywall) — In a column for the National Review, Dan McLaughlin offered some predictions about the court’s highly anticipated ruling in the tariffs case. He expects the justices to strike down the tariffs but believes “it’s very possible that the Court fractures along multiple lines in saying no.” He also think it’s “unlikely … that the Court will foreclose all future avenues for other Trump assertion of tariff powers, or that it will do much to address how unjustly paid tariffs can be recouped.”

A Closer Look: FBI v. Fazaga

Careful court watchers may recognize the case name FBI v. Fazaga. The justices heard a dispute by that name just over four years ago, which concerned the FBI and three Muslim men who lived and worshipped in Orange County, California.

The men had sued the FBI, alleging religious discrimination and other rights violations, after discovering that agents had paid an informant to gather information on them and their fellow worshippers as part of a counterterrorism operation. The federal government invoked its state-secrets privilege and moved to have the men’s religion claims dismissed, contending that allowing them to go forward would jeopardize national security.

When the Supreme Court got involved during the 2021-22 term, it was to address whether the state-secrets privilege can be trumped by a provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that outlines a way for a district court to review sensitive surveillance information behind closed doors in order to assess the legality of electronic surveillance conducted under FISA without jeopardizing national security. The justices unanimously held that the provision does not displace the privilege and sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit for further proceedings.

After four years, those further proceedings have resulted in an unworkable outcome for the federal government, according to U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who on Oct. 8 filed a petition for certiorari asking the Supreme Court to reenter the dispute. While the 9th Circuit “determined that the government appropriately invoked the state-secrets privilege,” it went on to adopt “improper and wholly novel procedural requirements that essentially negate the privilege in myriad cases,” Sauer contended.

Specifically, Sauer stated that the 9th Circuit’s new ruling in FBI v. Fazaga requires district courts to review privileged information in order to evaluate the government’s claim to the state-secrets privilege. Such a requirement essentially recreates the situation the federal government previously fought to avoid, Sauer wrote, transplanting the review procedures outlined in FISA to the “state-secrets doctrine itself.”

“That decision,” Sauer continued, “threatens significant and recurring national-security harm.” He urged the justices to either grant the new petition for review and hear arguments on how courts should respond to invocation of the state-secrets privilege or vacate the 9th Circuit’s ruling and remand the case to the district court, where it may be dismissed for other reasons (namely, because the former FBI informant who provided the information about surveillance activities that fueled the Muslim men’s lawsuit has now recanted his story).

In response, the challengers have asked the court to leave the 9th Circuit’s ruling in place, contending, as they have at previous points in the case, that the government’s invocation of the state-secrets privilege is preventing them from making a case that they’re willing to make with the “ample” amount of “non-privileged information” that is now available about the challenged surveillance program. It is appropriate, the men added, for the district court to review the privileged information that the government is trying to protect in order to assess the government’s assertion that it cannot mount a defense without jeopardizing national security.

The court considered the petition in FBI v. Fazaga for the first time during the Jan. 9 conference. It is scheduled to be considered again at tomorrow’s conference.

Justices wrestle with what, exactly, New Jersey Transit is

The Supreme Court on Wednesday debated whether New Jersey’s public transit agency can be sued in state courts in New York and Pennsylvania. The New Jersey Transit Corporation argues that it is an “arm” of the state and, therefore, immune from lawsuits elsewhere, but after a little over an hour of arguments, it was not clear whether a majority of justices agreed.

I sometimes think of what would have happened if I had let that first phone call go to voicemail. The line was unstable and I could discern only half the words, but I knew immediately why she was calling. For weeks, I’d been receiving dozens of calls like hers.

In the summer of 2020, I was working as a paralegal in Austin, Texas, remotely filling out asylum applications for migrants who were trapped in a dangerous limbo. A landmark policy of the first Trump administration—euphemistically called the “Migrant Protection Protocols,” or MPP—was keeping tens of thousands of immigrants stateless and often homeless in Mexico’s border regions while their asylum cases were adjudicated in U.S. border courts. Over half lost the chance to pursue asylum because they never received notice of their court date, or they fell victim to “routine” kidnappings, assaults, or sexual violence by cartel members. All of them were desperate for legal aid.

As much as I tried to stop it, my number had been passed around the Mexican borderland all summer, and I was inundated with calls. By the time Irma, a Venezuelan asylum-seeker who’d recently been deported from the U.S. border to Mexico, first contacted me, I had a standard answer: We were at capacity. I could not help anyone. (Irma asked that her name be changed for this because she fears retaliation from the U.S. government).

But she didn’t give me the chance to turn her away. Within minutes, she told me that her son had died after Mexican immigration officials deported him to Colombia. He’d had a respiratory complication related to his diabetes, she explained, possibly triggered by coronavirus. She began to cry.

“Tell me,” she asked in Spanish, “how can I bring his ashes to me?”

I remember pausing. I knew I had to tell her I couldn’t help her—I was under direct orders not to accept clients. But somehow, I couldn’t do it. She seemed so sure, already, that I could help. Irma spoke to me like she already knew me and loved me, as though I had already been kind to her. She called me “mija”—my daughter. She seemed to hold no mistrust toward me and my halting Spanish, no shard of suspicion that I could use to create the usual distance around myself.

After that call, I convinced my supervisor to make a rare exception for Irma and provide her with limited assistance with her asylum case. For months, we talked almost every night as I helped her prepare for her scheduled asylum hearing at the U.S. border—a hearing that would be delayed over and over again as COVID-19 shut down courtrooms across the country. I never figured out how to bring her son’s ashes to her. They remained in Colombia—as did his widow and daughters, pinned between familiar horror and new violence.

But Irma kept waiting for her day in court. Over the next years, I became transfixed by her asymmetrical struggle against the U.S. immigration system. As she moved to the U.S., reunited with her family, gained legal status—got almost everything she’d wanted—and lost it again, I kept answering her calls.

More than five years later, when U.S. forces struck Caracas, Venezuela, and seized President Nicolás Maduro and his wife to face narco-trafficking charges in federal court while continuing their unprecedented attack on asylum-seekers inside the United States, I’ve found myself increasingly unable to share her faith in American justice. As I watched the havoc caused by the vagaries of the U.S. immigration system, I kept returning to the same questions. Had I helped? Could anyone help? Was there enough justice left in the U.S. immigration system—enough order, enough impartiality—for help to be possible? Or had she just traded one set of dangers for another?

When Nicolás Maduro first assumed power in 2013, Irma was working as a campesina—a small-scale rural farmer—in Venezuela. She was happy then, she told me in our early conversations, marveling daily at the process of growing living things from the earth. At first, she was optimistic about Maduro, who had been a bus driver in Caracas and who she thought would serve the “humble.”

“Maduro, I knew him as a man who knew the people’s needs, because someone who drives a bus has passengers get on every day and hears their comments and knows what people suffer because of what’s happening,” she said a few weeks ago, when we discussed the (then) impending U.S. intervention into Venezuela.

Donald Trump, she believes, was born a tyrant. Maduro became one quickly after taking power—barely a year after he became president, Irma told me, she started seeing people picked off the streets by men with machine guns. These men belonged to groups known as colectivos—government-affiliated paramilitaries who repressed political protest and dissent in exchange for the opportunity to loot the dissenters.

The colectivos were part of the “very sophisticated repressive machine” that Maduro inherited from his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, explained Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College and author of Autocracy Rising: How Venezuela Transitioned to Authoritarianism. Chávez had led a “hybrid regime” that combined elements of both autocracy and democracy, Corrales said. Despite the corruption that pervaded his administration, Chávez presided over resource redistribution and significant reductions in poverty levels. His 2001 land reform program redistributed government-owned and private land to indigent residents willing to cultivate it.

Irma was one of Chávez’s direct beneficiaries; she received a parcel of arable land which she cultivated with her brother. She never viewed Chávez as a dictator, she told me—not because he defended democracy, but because he championed the downtrodden. Chávez “loved his people, protected us campesinos, protected the poor,” she explained. On Christmas, he gave his people hallacas, a traditional Venezuelan corn-dough holiday dish.

According to Corrales, when Maduro took power, he targeted the people who’d benefited directly from government programs, especially those who also displayed opposition to the government—even if their putative opposition consisted of speaking up to demand adequate water for their town or electricity for their local hospitals.

Irma herself was one of the recipients of government largesse who started speaking up. Local government officials were stealing from the farmers and selling the produce on the black market for personal profit. So Irma banded together with other recipients of farming plots to demand an end to the looting and assert the rights given to them by Chávez’s laws.

That’s when the colectivos came to her farm. She recalls watching them punch her brother and drag him off the farm in a black truck. After the truck drove off, Irma searched for him for hours with her brother’s wife and children, as the unbearable knowledge of where they would find him grew more solid.

“We went to the morgue and there he was,” Irma said.

A few weeks later, Irma said, the colectivos returned and destroyed her farm. They punched her, tied her up, and dragged her into the truck, and left her beaten on the side of the road with a warning to end her “radicalism.”

After her attempts to hide from the colectivos proved futile, Irma decided she had to start over somewhere new. She fled, becoming one of the nearly 8 million Venezuelans who left the country during Maduro’s reign.

Irma arrived at the U.S.–Mexico border midway through the first Trump administration. She waded across the cloudy Rio Grande and searched for an immigration officer she could ask for help. She knelt in front of the first officer she saw, told him she’d fled the colectivos, and pleaded for a chance to seek asylum.

The official put her in a crowded van and detained her for three days in a freezing border cell, which immigrants often refer to as a hielera, or icebox. After she was released, she was sent to Juárez, Mexico, under Migrant Protection Protocols—the Trump policy that kept people in limbo in Mexico’s dangerous border areas while their cases made their way through U.S. courts.

Her son died en route to join her in Mexico, leaving a widow and two young daughters in Colombia. She called me days after his death, while she was still living in a shelter in the largely cartel-controlled Mexican border town of Juárez. A few months later, she would end up on the streets, eventually sheltering inside the active construction site where she worked during the day. She told me then she had faced repeated sexual assaults from a local worker who threatened to toss her body in the river if she told anyone. “Imagine,” she told me then. “A grandmother, an old woman like me, alone.”

But she refused to give up on her only chance to seek refuge from the dictatorship that had killed her brother. She kept waiting, even when COVID-19 shut down the courts and her case was delayed indefinitely. I felt sickened by every piece of news I gave her—her court date canceled, the border closed, the pandemic spreading—but her faith in the system, and in me, seemed implacable. At some point, I realized that she was waiting out Donald Trump’s presidency. Time was the last thing left that could still help her.

When Joe Biden won the 2020 U.S. presidential election, she was triumphant. Biden promised to end MPP, the program keeping her trapped in Mexico, and restore the normal pathway to asylum. “I knew he was going to win against that arrogant child,” she said to me at the time.

Shortly after Biden took office, Irma was allowed to enter the country to pursue asylum. She reunited with her daughter and grandson in Houston, obtained Temporary Protected Status—a visa afforded to citizens of countries designated by the executive as especially dangerous—and got a job at a 7-Eleven. The joy she felt then “astonished” her, she told me when I drove to Houston to meet her and her family. She dreamed of saving money to open a food truck that would sell arepas throughout Texas.

“It was so beautiful,” she told me as I worked through the alarming amounts of food she’d cooked in honor of my visit. “I just didn’t expect it.”

But when Trump returned to office four years later, Irma was stripped of her status, her work permit, her mundane everyday freedoms. It would be the second time she would live through a government turning against her, and her second time in hiding. This time, however, she had nowhere to go.

After Trump retook office in 2025, his administration, guided by a slew of anti-immigrant executive orders, relentlessly stripped the statuses that had protected vulnerable noncitizens. They rolled back humanitarian and family reunification–based parole and stripped away Temporary Protected Status for residents of some of the world’s most destabilized countries, including South Sudan, Haiti, and Venezuela.

Irma was one of the hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who became newly undocumented under Trump’s policies. She told me that a co-worker outed her at work as having lost her status, and she was fired immediately. She moved away from the vibrant immigrant communities in Houston to live with her other daughter in the more homogenous and broadly affluent Austin, where there were fewer immigrants and therefore, she reasoned, fewer raids.

But even in Austin, she couldn’t risk going to church; she settled for watching sermons streamed live. She was consumed by the idea of Immigration and Customs Enforcement picking her up at home, or when she went to get her grandson from his special school (at 3, the child was still nonverbal, which Irma attributed to the fear his mother had experienced when she fled Venezuela, already eight months pregnant). Irma feared the indefinite detentions and inhumane treatment she’d heard about. “You don’t know what they’re going to do,” she said, “because they don’t want us here.”

Her fears are not overblown. Since this summer, clients at the nonprofit legal center I work at have been starved, denied their medicine, and kept in windowless cells where the lights never turn off, where there’s no room to lie down. Spurred by a $170 billion enforcement package that tripled ICE’s detention budget and by Trump’s Day 1 orders demanding “total and efficient” enforcement against all removable immigrants, ICE officers have stormed the streets with unprecedented intensity and violence.

In blitz raids across the country, ICE agents have picked up thousands of immigrants, many of whom had legal status in the United States and the vast majority of whom had no criminal record: Over the summer, ICE averaged over 1,000 arrests per day. In 2025, 32 people died in ICE custody. Its agents have become increasingly aggressive in their encounters with citizens and noncitizens alike—protesters, legal observers, and people they’re targeting at random. These killings appear not to trouble President Trump. After an ICE agent shot Renee Nicole Good in the face, killing her, Trump called the 37-year-old mother of three an “agitator,” adding that “we’re always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.”

These past few months, Irma says she’s been seeing something that she recognizes all too well: some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in society grabbed off the street and thrown in vans. And she’s living in fear of being grabbed again herself. “I don’t know when they’ll take me away,” she told me recently.

Scholars have a name for this phenomenon. Targeting the most vulnerable, political scientists have argued, is a hallmark of democracy backsliding. Corrales calls the process “victim inversion.”

“An autocracy needs to create an in-group versus an out-group,” Corrales explained. “You start with the most vulnerable precisely because they’re the easiest to go after. … Once you get your group to think in terms of in-groups versus out-groups, and that the out-groups are harming agents, repression is uncontainable.”

In Venezuela, the “out-group” consisted of anyone perceived as opposing the regime, Corrales said. In the United States, “what Trump has done is to focus on noncitizens. You see victim inversion: They’re very vulnerable, and the first thing is to turn them into harming agents.”

Maduro and Trump are both part of a global trend toward polarization and extremism, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a history professor at Pomona College who studies both modern Venezuela and the U.S.–Mexico border region. But both of these instances of democratic backsliding are “historically grounded in the particular situation” of their respective countries, he emphasized.

According to Tinker Salas, Maduro’s dictatorship sprang from Hugo Chávez’s regime, an economic crisis, and the failures of Chávez’s “cultural, social, political project.” Meanwhile, Trump rose to power in the vacuum created by “the inability of the Democrats to put forth a proposal for real change,” and the hollowing out of their commitment to equality with their embrace of neoliberalism.

Trump has used the out-group of noncitizens—conjuring the specters of dangerous internal and external enemies—to justify his startling consolidation of executive power. “In 2016, he began with the wall, … the Salvadorans, and then Mara Salvatrucha,” Tinker Salas said. “Now in 2025, targeting Venezuelans and the so-called Credenciales”—“credentialed” gang members—“it becomes the same phraseology, the same notion. … You’re trying to make immigrants the enemy from within.”

Trump relied on the same specter of an enemy within in justifying his intervention in Venezuela this month, which was ostensibly motivated by “drugs, immigration, and oil.” While many Venezuelan émigrés celebrated the ouster of Maduro, the man whose corruption had been instrumental in driving them out of their country, Irma herself was somber. She didn’t trust Maduro, but she didn’t want Trump to intervene, either. “Here, he’s made us suffer enough; imagine what he’s going to do inside my country,” she texted me over WhatsApp.

Irma is not hopeful about the future of her home country in Trump’s hands. Instead, she spends much of her time praying for Trump and his administration, including ICE agents, entreating Jesus to “soften the heart of Trump and of the people that work for him.” Even while she prays for softness, she says, she doesn’t expect it—and she hopes people will stand up and fight for the people being snatched off the street. After all, she knows firsthand how quickly democracy and rule of law can dissolve.

“I’ve lived through it—death, eviction, persecution—because I stood up to the government and refused to accept injustice. In our own country, we protested against the government, and many innocent people died. … But we can’t allow one person to destroy what belongs to all of us.”",https://compote.slate.com/images/838aee09-52a4-4430-a0fa-cef1092e2d51.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-15 16:58:52.836625

Eden Prairie police cannot ask about a person’s immigration status or share that information with ICE, he said.","Mayors, city managers and police chiefs from 15 Twin Cities suburbs gathered at the Eden Prairie Community Center on Wednesday to discuss the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Twin Cities.

The closed-door meeting brought together local officials to share information about recent ICE activity in their communities and to discuss possible next steps as ICE remains active across the metropolitan area and the state, Eden Prairie Mayor Ron Case said.

Representatives from Hennepin County, including Commissioner Debbie Goettel, and the chief of staff for U.S. Rep. Kelly Morrison were also in attendance.

Members of the media were not invited to the meeting, though Case spoke with Eden Prairie Local News afterward.

Case said mayors shared specific instances in which ICE agents allegedly followed residents without clear cause, including an incident in Brooklyn Park in which a Hispanic off-duty police officer was surrounded by agents while driving her personal vehicle. The officer told the agents she was a citizen and a police officer, but they did not allow her to leave until they eventually departed, Case said.

A representative from Richfield said there is growing concern about the impact ICE’s presence is having on students, with roughly one-third not attending school, Case said. Several restaurants in Richfield have also closed due to ICE activity in the city, raising concerns about lost wages and workers’ ability to pay their bills.

Officials from all cities in attendance, including Eden Prairie City Manager Rick Getschow and Police Chief Matt Sackett, encouraged U.S. citizens to call 911 if they encounter ICE and feel unsafe. While officers cannot intervene in or stop a federal arrest, they can respond, record interactions and help deescalate situations.

“Police departments across the area do not want to interfere with the job duties and the role of ICE, but the expectation is that ICE will follow the law as well,” Case said.

Eden Prairie has experienced several instances of ICE activity, but city officials are not notified in advance, Case said. Instead, the city typically learns of ICE’s presence after the fact, if someone calls 911.

Case reiterated the city’s previous statement that local police departments, including Eden Prairie’s, do not participate in federal immigration enforcement and enforce only state and local laws. Eden Prairie police cannot ask about a person’s immigration status or share that information with ICE, he said.

Case said he shared a few facts to illustrate the current situation in Minnesota during the meeting, including that there are about 100,000 undocumented immigrants in Minnesota, compared with about 2 million in Texas. Despite that difference, Texas has roughly 1,500 Border Patrol agents, while Minnesota has about 3,000 ICE agents and Border Patrol officers statewide, Case said.

“It begins to very much look like it’s not about immigration,” Case said.

Moving forward, Case said city officials plan to meet in Brooklyn Park early next week to coordinate outreach to Gov. Tim Walz, if possible. Mayors have also discussed writing letters to President Donald Trump and to Minnesota’s Republican members of Congress about what they view as the negative economic impacts of ICE’s expanded presence.

The group is also considering writing a letter to the editor of the Minnesota Star Tribune and contacting The New York Times in an effort to draw national attention to the impact ICE activity has had on suburban and smaller communities.

“People hear President Trump’s perspective, and they may hear Gov. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey’s perspectives, but they’re not hearing the perspectives of 30 suburban mayors whose residents and communities are being negatively impacted,” Case said.

Case noted that Minnesota communities have coexisted with ICE and have been aware of the agency’s presence since its creation in 2003, but said the scale and visibility of ICE activity now is unprecedented.

“This is different today — this is much different,” Case said.

Case added that oftentimes agents wear masks, making it difficult to identify them.

Several police chiefs across the metro also discussed difficulties contacting ICE leadership, Case said, noting they were told there is no central command for ICE in Minnesota.

“There’s no one you can report that behavior of ICE agents to,” Case said. “That’s the problem.”",https://www.eplocalnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mayors-Meeting-scaled-e1768434221777.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:58:18.721735

On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning nearly fifty years of abortion rights precedent. The decision across all opinions cited six different scholar briefs—amicus curiae submissions signed by law professors and academic experts—more than any other decision in recent memory. The opinion’s deployment of academic authority was both extensive and strategic. When challenging Roe’s treatment of common law abortion prohibitions, Alito invoked a brief from scholars of jurisprudence James Stoner and John Finnis, asserting that “’a quick child’ meant simply a ‘live’ child” under early modern understanding—a historical claim that, if accepted, would dramatically expand the temporal scope of abortion’s criminal prohibition. The opinion relied even more heavily on professional historians’ submissions to reconstruct nineteenth-century legislative intent. In a revealing methodological move, Alito cited historians’ work to demonstrate that “at least 26 of 37” states had criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy by 1868—the year the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified—thereby establishing the historical tradition against which contemporary abortion rights claims must be measured.

This intensive marshaling of academic expertise in Dobbs exemplifies a broader transformation in Supreme Court practice. The Justices increasingly turn to scholar briefs not merely for doctrinal synthesis—a traditional function of academic amici—but for empirical claims, historical reconstruction, and comparative constitutional analysis that shapes the Court’s understanding of fundamental legal questions. These submissions occupy a distinctive rhetorical space. Unlike party briefs, which advance partisan positions within adversarial constraints, scholar briefs purport to offer disinterested expertise. As Paul Collins observes, they “allow professors to make their views known to judges and provide expert knowledge and commentary from (ostensibly) neutral legal experts.” This neutrality—whether genuine or performed—confers epistemic authority that practicing attorneys cannot easily replicate. A multisignatory historians’ brief carries intellectual weight beyond its legal argumentation precisely because it appears to represent scholarly consensus rather than litigation strategy.

Yet the expanding influence of scholar briefs raises troubling questions about the relationship between academic knowledge production and judicial reasoning. Do these submissions genuinely inform constitutional interpretation, or do they merely provide scholarly imprimatur for conclusions reached through other means? When Justice Alito cites historians to demonstrate that abortion was widely criminalized in 1868, is he incorporating new historical evidence into his analysis, or mining academic briefs for convenient citations that support an outcome predetermined by his constitutional philosophy? The very features that give scholar briefs their authority—their claim to expertise, their apparent distance from litigation incentives, their aggregation of credentialed signatories—may also enable a form of motivated reasoning dressed in academic garb. Kelly Lynch acknowledges this ambiguity, noting that while “it is likely that in many cases scholars can have at least some beneficial effect on the development of the law,” the causal mechanisms remain opaque. We know that Justices cite scholar briefs with increasing frequency; we know far less about whether these citations reflect persuasion or mere justification.

This article examines an original dataset of 103 scholar briefs and over 2,300 individual scholars that contributed to these briefs cited by the Supreme Court between the 2015 and 2024 Terms to map the landscape of academic influence in contemporary constitutional adjudication. The analysis reveals which doctrinal domains attract scholarly intervention, which institutions and methodologies dominate the cited literature, and which cases generate the most intensive academic engagement. These patterns illuminate not only what kinds of expertise the Court values, but also the structural features of legal academia—institutional prestige, disciplinary boundaries, professional networks—that determine whose scholarly voices reach the Justices. More fundamentally, this empirical account sets the stage for a critical assessment of scholar briefs’ actual influence. If academic amici cluster predictably around elite institutions, if their historical claims align suspiciously well with litigants’ constitutional theories, if cases decided on originalist grounds systematically cite originalist historians while living constitutionalist opinions cite different scholars entirely, we might reasonably suspect that scholar briefs function less as genuine knowledge inputs than as rhetorical resources in an ideological struggle over constitutional meaning.

Along with contextualizing these citations, this article tracks attributes of the scholars and institutions that contributed most to the justices’ citations.

Methodology notes: The search parameters included briefs mentioning scholar(s) or professor(s) so there may be briefs that fall into the same category but were titled differently and were missed. This also only covers information specified within the briefs so while most briefs share the institution where a professor work and other details, there is no standardized information template used across briefs.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LNEg!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3093fa1b-3ffa-4bd3-b33f-ffd0eecabc9c_1247x831.jpeg",N,,2026-01-15 14:58:57.264761

Vance claimed that Ross has “absolute immunity,” suggesting that there are no circumstances under which the state could prosecute him.
(I leave aside the legal question of whether Ross would be considered a peace officer under Minnesota law.)","On Jan. 7, a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, identified by the media as Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Nicole Good in her car in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but despite an initial promise of collaboration, it subsequently informed state officials that it would not work with them. As a result, Hennepin County prosecutor Mary Moriarty and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison have launched their own investigation.

State criminal investigations and prosecutions of federal officials are unusual. And criminal charges against law enforcement officials at any level present unique legal and factual challenges. But as illustrated by Minnesota’s successful prosecution of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, law enforcement officers can be held accountable for crimes they commit. And longstanding historical precedent establishes that states can bring charges against federal officials under certain circumstances.

Whether Minnesota ultimately prosecutes Ross remains to be seen, and state officials’ decisions will depend on careful legal and evidentiary analysis. Without predicting outcomes, however, it’s worth both clarifying the state of the law—especially in the face of false claims from the Trump administration—and identifying some of the key issues Minnesota prosecutors will have to consider.

First, let’s debunk claims that the state has no role to play here. The day before Moriarty and Ellison announced the state investigation, Vice-President J.D. Vance claimed that Ross has “absolute immunity,” suggesting that there are no circumstances under which the state could prosecute him. And Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem claimed that the state has “no jurisdiction,” which is why, she said, it was shut out of the investigation. More recently, Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced that ICE agents “have immunity to fulfill their duties” and that “no one … can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.” In fact, Vance and Noem are completely wrong as a matter of law, and Miller’s claim holds water only insofar as ICE agents are in fact acting within their legal authority, which, as explained below, will be a central issue in any state prosecution.

The notion that Minnesota cannot investigate or prosecute a violation of its criminal laws within its borders is flatly inconsistent with our federalist system. As the Supreme Court has recently reiterated, the states and the federal government each have a sovereign interest in enforcing their own criminal laws. Sometimes that means that both a state and the federal government prosecute the same person for the same conduct, as happened with Derek Chauvin. When that happens, because of those separate sovereign interests, double jeopardy does not apply. Here, double jeopardy is not the key question (although at some point in the future a different federal administration could presumably prosecute Ross regardless of what Minnesota does). Instead, “dual sovereignty” in the present context means that the state has a legitimate interest in enforcing its laws even against federal actors.

Such cases are unusual, but they are not unprecedented. As Bryna Godar has documented, states have been bringing prosecutions against federal officials since at least the nineteenth century, including for crimes involving the use of force by law enforcement officials. These cases have involved charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, and other violent crimes, often brought against tax collectors or federal agents enforcing Prohibition. More recently, the state of Idaho brought murder charges against an FBI agent who shot and killed an unarmed woman during a lengthy stand-off known colloquially as “Ruby Ridge.” In other words, there is no question that Minnesota has jurisdiction to investigate and charge Ross with a crime and there is no automatic or absolute immunity because he is a federal officer. The administration’s claims otherwise are false.

Nonetheless, in deciding whether and how to proceed, Minnesota officials will face some challenges, from the factual investigation; to determining what, if any, charges to bring; to evaluating the defenses that Ross, as a law enforcement officer, may have—and the related likelihood that he could successfully claim what is known as “Supremacy Clause immunity,” which (contra Vance) is not absolute, but which Ross would almost certainly attempt to invoke.

As a practical evidentiary matter, if the FBI or other federal investigators do not share their investigatory files with the state, state officials have cautioned that they might determine that they do not have a sufficient evidentiary record to make a charging decision. That’s not a foregone conclusion, of course, and even if they conclude that they cannot charge Ross now, that assessment could change if a future administration is willing to share information with the state. (Minnesota has no statute of limitations “for any crime resulting in the death of the victim.”) In any event, at this time, Moriarty and Ellison are asking the public to share video and other information, and state officials are evaluating the evidence they already have. They may well conclude that they have sufficient evidence to prosecute Ross for any of a number of crimes, including various forms of murder and manslaughter and the failure to provide aid to a shooting victim.

Each of those crimes has its own set of elements, and the Minnesota prosecutors will review the evidence to see if it meets those elements. Derek Chauvin’s prosecution for killing George Floyd is a useful example. Chauvin was convicted of unintentional second degree murder, third degree murder, and second degree manslaughter. The unintentional second degree murder charge, which is comparable to what some states call felony murder, required showing that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing a separate felony, in that case a form of assault.

Third degree murder in Minnesota, of which Chauvin was also convicted, requires a showing that the defendant, “without intent to effect the death of any person, causes the death of another by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life …” In Chauvin’s case, the prosecution established those elements in part through evidence that the use-of-force training Chauvin received included instruction to avoid putting pressure on an individual’s neck, as Chauvin did to Floyd. Similarly, the second degree manslaughter charge required the prosecution to show that Chauvin “create[d] an unreasonable risk, and consciously t[ook] chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another.”

Minnesota prosecutors will also evaluate any state law arguments Ross might have. For example, Minnesota’s state law authorizes peace officers to use deadly force under some circumstances. As relevant here, peace officers can do so under that law

only if an objectively reasonable officer would believe, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officer at the time and without the benefit of hindsight, that such force is necessary: (1) to protect the peace officer or another from death or great bodily harm, provided that the threat: (i) can be articulated with specificity; (ii) is reasonably likely to occur absent action by the law enforcement officer; and (iii) must be addressed through the use of deadly force without unreasonable delay…

I would expect Minnesota prosecutors to evaluate the evidence carefully to see if Ross might be able to establish these factors, which I’ll address further below. (I leave aside the legal question of whether Ross would be considered a peace officer under Minnesota law.) And regardless of what they conclude about prosecuting the shooting itself, they will likely separately evaluate whether Ross – and his fellow ICE officers – violated Minnesota law requiring both a person who shoots someone and any witnesses to immediately investigate and render appropriate assistance.

Should Minnesota charge him, Ross will undoubtedly claim a form of immunity generally referred to as “Supremacy Clause immunity.” Contrary to Vance’s claim and Miller’s insinuation, however, Supremacy Clause immunity is not absolute. Rather, it balances the dual sovereignty already discussed with the additional principle that states cannot supersede federal laws. That balance means that Supremacy Clause immunity is available only to federal officials who are acting reasonably and lawfully in fulfilling their duties. More specifically, as Bryna Godar explained in November, it applies only if “[t]he federal official’s actions [were] … (a) authorized by federal law and (b) ‘necessary and proper’ in fulfilling the official’s federal duties.”

The inquiry into whether Supremacy Clause immunity applies in this case will thus likely include, for example, reviews of the federal government’s use-of-force policies to determine if Ross acted outside his authority and/or acted unreasonably. Those policies, for example, state that law enforcement officials (LEOs) “should … avoid intentionally and unreasonably placing themselves in positions in which they have no alternative to using deadly force”; they permit deadly force only “when the LEO has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the LEO or to another person”; they generally prohibit the use of deadly force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject”; and they specifically discourage LEOs from firing at “the driver of a moving vehicle.” The policies also require federal LEOs to “obtain appropriate medical care” after any use of force. If Ross violated these provisions, his immunity claim will be weaker. Likewise, the court will likely look at whether Ross used deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, including whether his failure to warn Good before firing his gun was unconstitutional.

This immunity inquiry also overlaps with Minnesota’s state law authorizing peace officers to use deadly force, described above. Under all of these inquiries, questions of whether Ross acted reasonably under the circumstances will play a central role. In other words, both the state prosecutors’ charging decisions and the immunity determination will depend on questions of fact about the details of what actually happened, as well as on questions of law as to the implications of those facts. For example, did Ross believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury when he fired the first shot? If so, was that belief reasonable? Did Ross prepare to draw his gun before or after Good’s car started moving, and if not, why did he shift his cellphone from his right to his left hand? Did Good’s car touch him at any point? What about Ross’s belief as to whether he was in danger when he fired the second and third shots? On what basis did he, and his colleagues, fail to provide assistance to Good after she was shot and prevent a physician who was on the scene from helping? All of these questions go to both whether Ross has Supremacy Clause immunity and to whether he is likely to be convicted if charged and tried.

Finally, whether Supremacy Clause immunity applies will almost certainly be decided by a federal court, even though any criminal charges would first be filed in Minnesota state court. That is because federal officials are able to remove both criminal and civil cases from state court to federal court if those cases involve actions taken “under color of” their federal office. If charged, Ross would almost certainly choose to remove the case. Even in federal court, however, state criminal prosecutors would remain in charge of the prosecution, and any conviction would be a conviction under state law. And the president cannot pardon a state law crime.

In closing, Minnesota unquestionably has jurisdiction to investigate and to bring criminal charges against Ross. And Ross does not have absolute immunity, although he will certainly claim Supremacy Clause immunity if charged. We simply do not know at this point whether such a claim of immunity is likely to be successful.

Those looking for quick resolutions are likely to be disappointed. I expect that the Minnesota authorities will carefully and deliberately analyze the evidence they have access to, so it could take some time for them to decide whether to prosecute Ross. Moreover, if and when the state does bring charges, the immunity issues will be litigated first. As a result, it could take a very long time—even years—before there is a trial, much less a conviction.

Regardless of what happens in this particular case, federal immigration officers around the country should be on notice that they do not have complete impunity. They can be prosecuted and may be convicted. Lawless violence and unconstitutional actions may, sooner or later, end with a prison sentence.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/minnesota_state_capitol-_st-_paul-_minnesota-(1).jpg?sfvrsn=7d1dc82a_5,N,,2026-01-15 14:59:02.137222

Our civil rights, our dignity

Por

Alex Domingos

-

Pennsylvanian has not been shielded from the Trump administration’s assault on civil liberties, epitomized by the cruel war against immigrants. Hispanic and Latine families across our commonwealth are enduring unparalleled threats while also confronting familiar obstacles that they’ve been navigating for generations.

Language barriers at the polls. Racial profiling by law enforcement. The lack of proper and equitable support in schools. These challenges are not new, but they are intensifying. Hispanic, Latine, and Black and brown immigrants are facing escalating attacks driven by disinformation campaigns designed to dehumanize entire communities and strip them of their constitutional rights.

These aren’t isolated challenges. They are daily reminders that dignity—basic human dignity—is still being negotiated in places where it should already be guaranteed.

At a time when immigrants’ rights are under attack, when fear too often replaces fairness, silence isn’t an option.

Millions of American family trees trace their roots to other lands. In Pennsylvania alone, one in six children has at least one immigrant parent. The truths and promises we hold to be self-evident in America would crumble if we ever stopped believing that immigrants aren’t worth protecting; we are them and they are us.

That’s why ACLU-PA launched “Dignity You Can’t Deny,” a campaign born to honor Hispanic Heritage Month but designed to live far beyond it. Our message is simple: celebrating Hispanic Heritage means defending civil rights.

Through this effort, we’ve elevated the conversations that matter most to Hispanic and Latine communities, such as the rights students have to an education, regardless of immigration status; how to vote without intimidation and what to do if polls do not have language resources; and how to stand firm in our humanity when policies or prejudice try to diminish it.

Because dignity isn’t a gift governments can give or take away, it’s an inherent right that belongs to every one of us.

Protecting dignity begins with understanding your rights, and helping others understand theirs. There are plenty of opportunities to help others exercise their rights. It’s also critical that we all participate in our democracy to ensure that the leaders we elect guard our rights, value our humanity and differences, and support policies that protect us so we can live freely and safely without discrimination.

Being active in our democracy starts at the ballot box — but that’s not where it ends. We can all speak out, protest, organize, and stay informed, strengthening our collective dignity so that everyone in our community is empowered to maintain their own.

As the ACLU of Pennsylvania, we are committed to educating and providing resources and opportunities for us all to join the fight to defend immigrants. Immigrants enrich our country and have the right to be here; our Constitution extends many of the protections we all cherish to all immigrants, regardless of status, recognizing that dignity should be based on personhood, not paperwork.

We’re supporting students and parents to know their rights.

We’re working in coalition to advocate for Welcoming policies in local counties and schools.

We’re urging Gov. Shapiro to end state collaboration with ICE.

We’re monitoring for and suing when there are civil liberty violations against Black and brown people being targeted, profiled, abducted, and inhumanely detained because of the Trump administration’s aggressive and unconstitutional deportation agenda.

We’re mobilizing to take action, together.

Most importantly, we’re working to flip the narrative, understanding that when dignity is honored as fundamental, our lives, families, and society become better for us all.

His 36% approval rating on his handling of the economy is at its lowest point for both his first and second terms.
Trump had a 40% approval rating and 54% disapproval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll taken Dec. 11-15 among 1,035 registered voters (margin of error 3.9), unchanged from Trump’s October approval/disapproval rating.
The New York Times’s polling average found Trump had a 42% approval rating and 55% disapproval rating after several weeks of declining support.
Biden had a -9 net approval rating at this point in his term and Trump had a -15 net approval rating at this point in his first term, according to Economist/YouGov polling.","Trump’s 40% approval rating in the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research January survey is largely consistent with his numbers throughout the first year of his second term—and are similar to his ratings in his first term, when he entered the presidency with a 42% approval rating and left office with nearly the same number.

Americans’ views of Trump’s handling of immigration—one of his signature issues—have declined sharply throughout his first year in office, however, reaching 38% in January, down from 49% in March last year.

The poll overlapped with several high-profile shootings involving ICE officers, including the death of Renee Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7, when an ICE agent shot multiple rounds through her car window at close range in an incident captured by bystanders’ video—prompting a heated partisan debate about whether she was aiming to hit the officer with her vehicle, with some on the right breaking with Trump and his allies in denouncing the shooting as an unjustified use of force.

Trump’s approval rating increased to 40% from 36% in December, while his disapproval rating decreased from 61% to 59% in the latest AP/NORC poll of 1,203 U.S. adults conducted Jan. 8-11 (margin of error 3.9).

Despite the improvement in Trump’s overall approval rating, the poll found a plurality of respondents (45%) want the U.S. to take a less active role in solving global issues, an increase from the 33% who said the same in December.

Trump’s approval rating was also at 40% in the latest Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday and his disapproval rating was 56%, a slight improvement from last week (the poll of 1,437 registered voters was conducted Jan. 9-12 and has a margin of error of 3.1).

Trump’s 39% approval rating and 56% disapproval rating is unchanged from last week’s Economist/YouGov survey of 1,551 U.S. adults taken Jan. 2-5 (margin of error 3.3).

Trump’s approval rating dipped one point, to 46%, in the latest Morning Consult survey, consistent with his average job performance rating throughout his second term, according to the poll of 2,201 registered U.S. voters taken Jan. 2-4 (margin of error 2).

Trump’s approval rating ticked up three points, to 42%, and his disapproval rating decreased three points, to 56%, in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,248 U.S. adults taken Jan. 4-5, after the U.S. captured Maduro and his wife in a stunning raid early Saturday.

Views of Trump’s job performance improved to their highest point since October, despite only one in three Americans approving of the military operation and 72% saying they’re worried the U.S. will become too involved in Venezuela, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, which has a margin of error of 3).

Trump ends the year with a 39% approval rating and 56% disapproval rating in the Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll following a downward trend since the start of his second term linked to his handling of the economy—as more than half of poll respondents, 51%, said they believe the economy is getting worse (the latest survey of 1,550 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 26-29 and has a 3.6-point margin of error).

Trump’s -17% net approval rating compares to a -14% net approval rating after the first year of his first term and a -10% net approval rating after Biden’s first year, according to Economist/YouGov polling.

Trump had a 41% approval rating and 50% disapproval rating in an Emerson College poll of 1,000 voters taken Dec. 14-15 (margin of error 3).

The numbers are nearly the same as they were in November, when Trump also had a 41% approval rating and a 49% disapproval rating, but are a sharp turn from his 49% approval/41% disapproval rating in the group’s January poll taken at the start of his term.

Trump’s overall job performance had a 38% approval rating in the latest NPR/PBS/Marist poll of 1,440 adults conducted Dec. 8-11 (margin of error 3.2), while 54% disapprove.

His 36% approval rating on his handling of the economy is at its lowest point for both his first and second terms.

Trump had a 40% approval rating and 54% disapproval rating in a Quinnipiac University poll taken Dec. 11-15 among 1,035 registered voters (margin of error 3.9), unchanged from Trump’s October approval/disapproval rating.

Trump’s approval rating decreased from 41% to 39% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll, compared to the groups’ poll the previous week week, while his disapproval rating also increased from 57% to 59% (the poll of 1,016 respondents was taken Dec. 12-15 and has a three-point margin of error).

Approval of Trump’s handling of the economy slipped from 36% to 33% while the share of respondents who said they disapprove increased from 52% to 58%.

Trump’s 36% approval rating was unchanged from AP-NORC’s November poll in its survey of 1,146 adults conducted Dec. 4-8 (margin of error 4), but his rating on the economy dipped to 31%, a low point for both terms.

Trump’s approval rating ticked up to 41% from 38% in late November in Reuters/Ipsos’ poll, while his disapproval rating decreased from 60% to 57% (the poll of 4,434 U.S. adults was conducted Dec. 3-8 and has a two-point margin of error).

The uptick coincided with an increase in his performance on the cost of living—from 26% last month to 31% this month among all respondents, driven by a 10-point gain among Republican voters.

Trump has sought to improve voters’ views on his handling of the economy, kicking off an “affordability tour” in Pennsylvania.

The New York Times’s polling average found Trump had a 42% approval rating and 55% disapproval rating after several weeks of declining support.

The data shows voters increasingly disapprove of his handling of the economy—net approval of his economic performance has fallen across surveys—with just 26% percent of respondents believing Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.

Trump has also seen faltering numbers from within his own party and one-time supporters: Only 75% of Republicans approved of his handling of the economy in November, down from 82% in July, according to Marquette University polling, and his approval rating among white, college-educated men has dropped to 40% from 47% in June, according to polling from Fox News.

The Economist/YouGov’s weekly poll of 1,628 U.S. adults taken Nov. 28-Dec. 1 found Trump had a 38% approval rating and 57% disapproval rating, the seventh straight week his net approval rating was -15 or lower (the survey has a margin of error of 3.2).

In Trump’s first term, his net approval rating never dipped to or below -15 for more than three consecutive weeks, YouGov noted.

Biden had a -9 net approval rating at this point in his term and Trump had a -15 net approval rating at this point in his first term, according to Economist/YouGov polling.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6932ef30ce4d95a104172573/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-15 13:58:23.528429

The Facebook Live stream showed more than a half dozen law enforcement agents on the sidewalk beside the city's bus station on Union Street. Multiple sources confirmed to CBS 6 that the agents were working for ICE. The video was shared hundreds of times within an hour before being removed before noon.

""I literally got the call a few moments ago, 'Yo, ICE is in Petersburg, snatching people up,'"" Petersburg businessman Ajani Sekov said.

Sekov said he immediately ran from his Washington Street shop to Union Street when he heard about the operation. He planned to intervene if he felt anyone's rights were being violated.

""We're a small, tight-knit community and we're going to stand together. I promise you. We're standing together,"" Sekov said.

The citizenship status of the individuals witnesses said were taken away during the operation is not yet clear. Petersburg police had no advance notice about the operation.

ICE conducts operation in Petersburg, Virginia

One concerned citizen, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, drove to downtown Petersburg after seeing the video online.

""My first immediate feeling and thought was anger, it was like, doesn't make any sense,"" the person said. ""There's a few of us out here, at least just looking to get in between and keep them from harassing people who are, you know, American citizens. People don't deserve be harassed.""

Witnesses reported that the federal agents spent approximately 30 minutes on Union Street before leaving the area.

While ICE operations are not new in Virginia, sources indicated that some city leaders believed this was the first time ICE has made arrests in Petersburg in such a highly visible public location.

It's also one of the first operations since nationwide protests following the shooting death of Renee Good in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the hands of an ICE officer.

Neither police nor city leaders agreed to speak on camera about the ICE operation.

In June 2025, Governor Glenn Youngkin addressed ICE arrests in Virginia stating: ""We have a statewide collaboration and partnership between state police and I and ICE and FBI and DEA working to make sure that violent criminals who are here illegally are arrested.""

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that starting Feb. 1 he will deny federal funding to any states that are home to local governments resisting his administration's immigration policies, expanding on previous threats to cut off resources to the so-called sanctuary cities themselves.

Such an action could have far-reaching impacts across the U.S., potentially even in places that aren't particularly friendly to noncitizens. Two previous efforts by Trump to cut off some funding for sanctuary jurisdictions were shut down by courts.

""Starting Feb. 1, we're not making any payments to sanctuary cities or states having sanctuary cities, because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come,"" he said. ""So we're not making any payment to anybody that supports sanctuary cities.""

Back in Washington, Trump was asked by reporters what kind of funding would be affected on Feb 1: ""You'll see,"" he said. ""It'll be significant.""

There is no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

I went back to where the two smashed-up ICE vehicles were.","After Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot at least one person in north Minneapolis on the night of January 14, a crowd gathered and faced them down, confronting them and tearing down the yellow tape they put up around the area. Police reinforced the federal mercenaries, joining them in shooting a tremendous amount of tear gas and flash-bang grenades at demonstrators as well as at passing cars and houses in the residential district. Nonetheless, the officers lost control of the area and retreated, ceding the streets to those who had defied them.

In the process, ICE agents abandoned several vehicles in the area. Demonstrators opened up the vehicles and found identity cards, paperwork, license plates, operational plans, tactical gear, and other items. Footage of demonstrators looking through these materials was broadcast live on the internet.

This follows the atrocious murder, one week earlier, of Renee Good, perpetrated by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in the full light of day and captured on multiple videos. You can read an account of how demonstrators responded here.

Over the past month and a half, the Trump regime has sent more and more troops to the Twin Cities because they know that what happens there has implications for the whole country—and because they are losing. If the battle of Minneapolis in winter 2026 turns out the way that the battle of Portland turned out in summer 2020, it will bode ill for Trump’s ability to retain control by brute force.

It is important to note the role that local Minneapolis police played in assaulting demonstrators tonight, despite their nominally answering to a Democratic city government that has paid lip service to opposing ICE. Police across the country have played an essential role in enabling ICE to terrorize communities. Without the continuous assistance and support of local police departments, federal agencies would already have been outmaneuvered by protest movements. When Democrat politicians claim that they need to “maintain order,” they are attempting to position themselves as junior partners in the consolidation of fascism. It may be in their interests to “maintain order” as mercenaries kidnap and murder people, but it is not in ours.

We offer here an account from the protests following the shooting in North Minneapolis, sent to us anonymously.

I had two hours left at my work shift when my phone started blowing up. Several comrades didn’t know where I was and thought I might be out in the street.

“Where are you?”

“You OK????”

“Shots fired at 24th and Lyndale”

“They just shot another person”

Every rapid response group chat was talking about the same thing. All kinds of rumors were flying around. Did they shoot one person or two? Were the victims alive or dead? Somebody said ICE had shot a 12-year-old Venezuelan boy in the leg. Somebody else said the victim was hiding in his house for fear of arrest and desperately needed medical attention. I didn’t know what to believe.

It’s always like that when a new emergency is going down. In the course of the past 45 days of federal occupation, scrambling through a fog of war to find out what just happened has become a familiar sensation. Somebody sent me a livestream of a crowd running away as ICE agents shot tear gas grenades and flashbangs at them.

Time slowed to a crawl. I hurried to finish up the drudgery I was working on as fast as I could. When I felt like I could get away with it, I told my coworkers I had a family emergency and I had to leave early. I jumped in my car and ran every stop sign on the way to 24th and North Lyndale.

I ran into a crew of street medics two blocks north of the crowd. They told me about what they’d seen before I got there. ICE had snatched two kids suspected of throwing a firework at them—20 masked thugs charging up to grab the kids, only to release them half an hour later under intense pressure from the rest of the crowd. The medics warned me that they were going to get out before the cops started mass-arresting people. In their opinion, I was walking into a kettle. The air already stank of tear gas.

At 24th Street, I found a crowd of about a hundred people facing off against a skirmish line of Minneapolis Police Department pigs in riot gear. The feds had already left and handed over the situation to the local cops. Somebody was slowly beating a drum. To my right, kids stood up on an elevated front lawn, screaming “Fuck ICE!” and “Fuck 12!” down at MPD. Somebody was brandishing a tear gas canister that had been fired at them, showing it off to their friends. A TV news crew was there. They tried to talk to me. I pushed my way through the crowd to get away from the cameras. Beyond the skirmish line, a block south on Lyndale near 23rd, I heard the sound of shattering glass.

I doubled back and went around the block. I came out on the other side of the skirmish line. There was a crowd of young people on this side, too. They were smashing up two SUVs that I recognized immediately as ICE vehicles by their blacked-out windows and out-of-state plates. Guys were trading kicks at the glass. Somebody was proudly displaying a big Mexican flag. One young person jumped up on the hood and stomped her foot through the windshield. Somebody with a can of red spray-paint tagged “HANG KRISTI NOEM” on the side of the other car.

A few people pulled a locked gun safe out of the trunk of one of the cars. Somebody dumped a fingerprinting kit on the ground. Someone else was rifling through a folder of documents at a frantic pace, snapping pictures of each one with a cell phone. There was an ICE face mask in the driver-side door of the nearest SUV. Appropriately enough, there was an ice scraper on the floor of the vehicle.

Suddenly, I heard a loud bang behind me. The familiar acrid taste of tear gas filled my nostrils. I started running south with the rest of the crowd. When we got to the next intersection, however, I turned around and saw that the cops were pulling back, shooting projectiles at the crowd as they moved east on 24th. The crowd got its bearings and we turned around and ran back up to 24th. There were such huge clouds of tear gas to the east of us that I couldn’t see the cops anymore.

“This is one! This is ICE!” I heard somebody yelling excitedly. She was pointing at another silver SUV parked on 24th. I checked the plates against the database of ICE vehicles that activists keep, saw that she was correct, and instantly felt silly for doing clerical work in the middle of a riot. Someone started whacking one of the side windows with the ice scraper that had been in the previous vehicle, striking it as hard as possible. After a few swings, there was a satisfying crunch as the window gave in. People around me began kicking in these windows, too. Somebody got the driver’s side door open and threw a firecracker inside.

Some overzealous cameraman—I couldn’t tell if it was the same guy from before—muscled his way through the crowd to get a shot of the ICE vehicle receiving this treatment. “No video!” someone roared at him. “If you let him take pictures of this shit, somebody is going to jail!” A few people forcefully encouraged the cameraman to turn around and leave the area.

When the tear gas cleared, I saw that the cops were gone. It seemed too good to be true. I ran up a couple blocks to scout the perimeter. They were nowhere to be seen.

I went back to where the two smashed-up ICE vehicles were. A festive block party mood had set in. People were setting off fireworks. Somebody was trying to pry open the gun case. Someone was dancing on top of a vehicle again while someone else blasted “I Don’t Fuck With You” by Big Sean. Young folks passed around a bottle of Hennessy. A lane of traffic had opened up. Some passing motorists raised their fists out the window and shouted “FUCK ICE!”

“I’m so proud of my city,” I found myself murmuring out loud. After seven weeks of atrocities at the hands of these fascists, people were finally fighting back. I thought about the liberals who were at home wringing their hands about how we were supposedly giving the feds an excuse for a crackdown (what the fuck did they think was already happening?) and posting on Facebook about the “language of the unheard.” The newfound comrades I was partying with around the looted vehicles seemed perfectly eloquent to me.

The George Floyd uprising of 2020 was never very far away. Its specter has haunted Minneapolis throughout everything that has happened for the last month and a half. Tonight, January 14, it finally assumed corporeal form again. People will remember tonight as the opening salvo of the people’s counterattack against a fascist invasion.

When history is written the way it ought to be written, it will not be our ferocity, but rather, the moderation and long patience of the Twin Cities that will make people shake their heads in wonder.",https://cdn.crimethinc.com/assets/articles/2026/01/15/1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 15:59:02.851258

Ward leader Jason Chavez spoke about seeing ICE questioning people based on how they looked, calling it racial profiling and noting that non-white Minnesotans have had to begin carrying passports with them to prove citizenship if stopped.

“What we are seeing in Minneapolis and this state should not be normalized,” he said.

Chavez asked Minnesotans to support their immigrant neighbors, providing mutual aid, supporting businesses and using whistles to alert people of ICE actions.

Community leaders said ICE officers were escalating the violence on the streets, not protesters, saying they were destabilizing communities and making the streets less safe.

They detailed incidents, including arrests of U.S. citizens, car accidents caused by ICE and ICE officers pushing people into traffic.

One woman described being mocked and taunted by ICE after being detained and reported that an ICE officer told her that protesters needed stop mocking them because “that’s why that lesbian b—- is dead.” She described hearing people screaming and begging in the detention center where she was held as ICE officers made small talk and joked with each other.

The woman said her friend, who was detained at the same time, was offered expedited processing for any undocumented family members if he gave up the names of undocumented people or protesters to ICE.

Minneapolis City Council President Elliot Payne said he was observing ICE operations, including one officer who was pointing his taser at people, when an officer pushed him off the sidewalk from behind.

“You have the right to observe these operations,” he said. “You have the right to keep your door shut, you have the right to demand a judicial warrant and if they do not have a judicial warrant, you do not have to open your door.”

Local leaders also announced a new, regular livestream update on the situation in Minnesota, with details to come later.

Trump comments on death of Renee Good

President Donald Trump called Renee Nicole Macklin Good‘s actions before her death “pretty tough,” seemingly backing his administration’s interpretation of the highly contested ICE shooting in Minnesota.

Good’s father, a Trump supporter, is heartbroken that the administration labeled his daughter a “domestic terrorist” within hours of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shooting her last week, according to CBS.

“I want to say to the father that I love all of our people,” Trump said in an interview published Tuesday.

Federal officials have consistently claimed Jonathan Ross was justified in shooting Macklin Good, who they say was attempting to run him over. But activists and lawmakers alike in Minnesota contend she was merely trying to leave the scene when she reversed her vehicle.

Trump acknowledged footage of her shooting death “can be viewed two ways, I guess,” but said there are “a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.”

“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person,” he said. “But, you know, her actions were pretty tough.”

ICE officer who shot Renee Good had internal bleeding after: DHS

Ross suffered internal bleeding after the shooting, a Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation on Wednesday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has previously said Ross was hit by Macklin Good’s vehicle on Jan. 7, backing up the administration’s claims he shot her in “self-defense.”

“He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,” Noem said last week.

Minnesota ICE shooting: Protests continue, prosecutors resign

Trump’s comments come on the heels of heated protests in Minneapolis, where demonstrators are admonishing the use of force in Macklin Good’s case and calling for federal immigration agents to leave the city.

On Tuesday, federal immigration agents deployed at least four rounds of flashbangs on crowds outside an ICE facility. Protests outside the newly fenced-in Henry Whipple Federal Building also escalated throughout the day.

ICE officers were seen busting a woman’s car window, pulling her out and arresting her Tuesday after she tried to drive down the street where a protest had broken out in front of a home ICE was raiding.

The woman said she was autistic and was trying to get to a doctor’s appointment.

The Trump administration officials have stressed that anyone who tries to stop or obstruct ICE officers is committing a felony.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Renee Good, in a car eight days ago in Minneapolis, and the protests have spread to other cities. Trump's latest threat came a few hours after an immigration officer shot a Venezuelan man the government said was fleeing after agents tried to stop his vehicle in Minneapolis.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" Trump wrote on social media.

Trump, a Republican, has for weeks derided the state's Democratic leaders and called the Somali community in the area ""garbage"" who should be ""thrown out"" of the country.

He has already sent nearly 3,000 federal officers into the Minneapolis area, who have carried guns through the city's icy streets, wearing military-style camouflage gear and masks that hide their faces.

They have been met frequently by loud, often angry protests by residents, some blowing whistles or banging tambourines.

The agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars, and have been shouted at for several episodes where they have stopped Black and Latino U.S. citizens and demanded identification.

'DISGUSTING AND INTOLERABLE'

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing Trump's immigration crackdown, said that just before Wednesday's shooting, two people attacked the federal officer with a broomstick and snow shovel as he wrestled with the Venezuelan man on the ground outside a home he had been running towards.

The officer ""fired defensive shots to defend his life,"" the DHS statement said. The DHS said the man had been allowed into the U.S. by the administration of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, in 2022 through the government's humanitarian parole program.

The Trump administration, which has sought to revoke Biden-era immigration and asylum programs, accused him of being in the country illegally.

Reuters was not able to verify the account given by DHS.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told reporters at a late-night press conference that the FBI and Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension were gathering evidence from the scene. The man's injuries were not life-threatening and he was recovering in hospital, O'Hara said.

Speaking alongside O'Hara, Mayor Jacob Frey called the ICE surge an invasion and said he had seen ""conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable.""

""We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,"" Frey said.

TRUMP SUPPORTERS DIVIDED OVER IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

The Insurrection Act of 1807 is a law allowing the president to deploy the military or federalize soldiers in a state's National Guard to quell rebellion, an exception to laws that prohibit soldiers being used in civil or criminal law enforcement.

It has been used 30 times in U.S. history, according to New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. The Supreme Court has ruled that the president alone can determine if the act's conditions have been met.

Trump has already taken the unusual step of federalizing National Guard soldiers to help with immigration law enforcement in Democrat-run cities over the objections of state governors, including in Los Angeles last year, which a judge ruled in December was unconstitutional.

Trump's aggressive moves in Minnesota have divided his supporters: 59% of Republicans favored a policy prioritizing arrests by immigration officers even if people get hurt, while 39% said officers should focus on reducing harm to people even if it means fewer arrests, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey released on Thursday.

If Trump sends soldiers to Minnesota, he would almost certainly face legal challenges by the state. The Minnesota attorney general's office has already sued the Trump administration this week, saying the ICE surge was violating Minnesotans' rights, and on Wednesday asked U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez to issue a temporary order restraining it.

Brian Carter, a lawyer for Minnesota, told the judge that Trump's agents were engaged in a ""pattern of unlawful, violent conduct,"" including racial profiling and forced entry into residents' homes without warrants.

""They are foisting this crisis onto us,"" Carter said.

In a social media post on Thursday morning, Trump said incorrectly that the judge had ""declined to block"" the ICE surge.

In the hearing, Judge Menendez ordered the Trump administration to respond by Monday to Minnesota's complaints, saying she would rule after that, calling the issues raised by Minnesota's lawsuit ""enormously important.""

""They deal with the very fundamental relationships between the government and the state and municipalities,"" she said.

But, she adds, a truism in American business is that political instability is not good for bottom lines.","Since Donald Trump returned to the White House last January, the biggest names in tech have mostly fallen in line with the new regime, attending dinners with officials, heaping praise upon the administration, presenting the president with lavish gifts, and pleading for Trump’s permission to sell their products to China. It’s been largely business as usual for Silicon Valley over the past year, even as the administration ignored a wide range of constitutional norms and attempted to slap arbitrary fees on everything from chip exports to worker visas for high-skilled immigrants employed by tech firms.

But after an ICE agent shot and killed an unarmed US citizen, Renee Nicole Good, in broad daylight in Minneapolis last week, a number of tech leaders have begun publicly speaking out about the Trump administration’s tactics. This includes prominent researchers at Google and Anthropic, who have denounced the killing as callous and immoral. The most wealthy and powerful tech CEOs are still staying silent as ICE floods America’s streets, but now some researchers and engineers working for them have chosen to break rank.

More than 150 tech workers so far have signed a petition asking for their company CEOs to call the White House, demand that ICE leave US cities, and speak out publicly against the agency’s recent violence. Anne Diemer, a human resources consultant and former Stripe employee who organized the petition, says that workers at Meta, Google, Amazon, OpenAI, TikTok, Spotify, Salesforce, Linkedin, and Rippling are among those who have signed. The group plans to make the list public once they reach 200 signatories.

“I think so many tech folks have felt like they can’t speak up,” Diemer told WIRED. “I want tech leaders to call the country’s leaders and condemn ICE’s actions, but even if this helps people find their people and take a small part in fighting fascism, then that’s cool, too.”

Nikhil Thorat, an engineer at Anthropic, said in a lengthy post on X that Good’s killing had “stirred something” in him. “A mother was gunned down in the street by ICE, and the government doesn’t even have the decency to perform a scripted condolence,” he wrote. Thorat added that the moral foundation of modern society is “infected, and is festering,” and the country is living through a “cosplay” of Nazi Germany, a time when people also stayed silent out of fear.

Jonathan Frankle, chief AI scientist at Databricks, added a “+1” to Thorat’s post. Shrisha Radhakrishna, chief technology and chief product officer of real estate platform Opendoor, replied that what happened to Good is “not normal. It's immoral. The speed at which the administration is moving to dehumanize a mother is terrifying.” Other users who identified themselves as employees at OpenAI and Anthropic also responded in support of Thorat.

Shortly after Good was shot, Jeff Dean, an early Google employee and University of Minnesota graduate who is now the chief scientist at Google DeepMind and Google Research, began re-sharing posts with his 400,000 X followers criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, including one outlining circumstances in which deadly force isn’t justified for police officers interacting with moving vehicles.

He then weighed in himself. “This is completely not okay, and we can't become numb to repeated instances of illegal and unconstitutional action by government agencies,” Dean wrote in an X post on January 10. “The recent days have been horrific.” He linked to a video of a teenager—identified as a US citizen—being violently arrested at a Target in Richfield, Minnesota.

In response to US vice president JD Vance’s assertion on X that Good was trying to run over the ICE agent with her vehicle, Aaron Levie, the CEO of the cloud storage company Box, replied, “Why is he shooting after he’s fully out of harm’s way (2nd and 3rd shot)? Why doesn’t he just move away from the vehicle instead of standing in front of it?” He added a screenshot of a Justice Department web page outlining best practices for law enforcement officers interacting with suspects in moving vehicles.

Even venture capitalist Jason Calacanis, who cohosts the popular All In podcast with White House AI and crypto adviser David Sacks, suggested that “masked unidentified federal agents asking people for their ‘papers’ are breaking the 4th amendment.”

Thorat, Dean, Levie, and Calacanis did not immediately respond to requests for comment from WIRED.

The tech sector’s response to sociopolitical crises over the past several years have been a mixed bag. During the nationwide protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder six years ago, many large tech companies issued statements against systemic racism and police brutality and pledged to diversify their workforces. Some of those commitments were criticized as being hollow, and “DEI” soon became a political flashpoint rather than a shared corporate goal. But now, in the wake of Good’s death and other reports of alleged violence by ICE agents, big tech companies and their CEOs are choosing to stay silent, a testament to how the political landscape in the US has rapidly changed.

There’s a long history in the US of business leaders avoiding taking a stand on political issues, says Margaret O’Mara, a historian who studies the history of politics and Silicon Valley. It was perhaps naive, she says, to believe that tech leaders were ever really kinder, gentler capitalists, even if they positioned their companies as socially progressive. “It’s important to remember that many of these tech leaders are people who are thinking about things from a business point of view,” O’Mara says.

But, she adds, a truism in American business is that political instability is not good for bottom lines. “The reason why American tech has been so successful is because the political climate has been calm enough for people to build great companies,” O’Mara says. Some leaders may want to believe that ICE arrests and the icy streets of Minnesota are far enough away from their own boardrooms not to have any impact, but that belief might not hold much longer.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6965992c482e29ae79e365d8/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Backlash-Against-ICE-Policing-Tactics-Business-2242486803.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 13:58:47.543549

In September, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered him deported to Syria or Algeria based on a separate rationale the Trump administration tacked on after Khalil’s arrest in Manhattan: failing to disclose certain information on his green card application.

Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., is appealing the deportation order through the Board of Immigration Appeals. Khalil’s lawyers have said that any appeal of the BIA decision, which would go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, is unlikely to be successful, since the appeals court “almost never” grants stays of removal to noncitizens.

Separately, a federal district court last year ordered Khalil to be released from detention after he had been held for more than three months in Louisiana. It’s not clear what the 3rd Circuit’s ruling means for his release.

Further complicating the situation is a separate decision expected Thursday from U.S. District Judge William Young. The Boston-based Reagan appointee ruled in September that the administration had violated the free speech rights of campus activists when Young targeted pro-Palestinian international students with arrest and deportation. Now, he’s slated to decide what the remedy for those violations should be.

Young’s case centered on the arrests and attempted deportations of five activists, including Khalil. So Young’s decision could influence the administration’s next steps.

The 3rd Circuit panel consisted of Judge Thomas Hardiman, appointed by then-President George W. Bush; Judge Stephanos Bibas, appointed by President Donald Trump; and Judge Arianna Freeman, appointed by then- President Joe Biden. Freeman wrote a partial dissent, disagreeing that the matter should proceed through immigration court.

Khalil’s lawyers noted that Thursday’s decision doesn’t go into effect immediately, adding that “the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Mr. Khalil until the order takes formal effect.”

Esha Bhandari, a member of Khalil’s legal team, said the decision “does not weigh in on the core First Amendment questions in this case and we are heartened by a strong dissent.” She added that “we have several options available for next steps, including being able to seek review en banc from the Third Circuit. The status quo remains in place while we continue the legal fight.”

Khalil himself acknowledged that “the door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line,” but added: “I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether the administration intends to re-detain Khalil.

“The immigration laws enacted by Congress ordinarily require an alien to challenge his deportation in a [petition for review of a final order of removal]—unless he raises questions that a court of appeals could not meaningfully review in that context. That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two,” Thursday’s decision said.

“But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fed%2Ffa%2F6d1413a64490b0ac8d945b023f86%2Fcampus-protests-mahmoud-khalil-15993.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 12:59:00.403442

What we know

The Department of Homeland Security said a federal officer shot a Venezuelan man in the leg in Minneapolis this evening after the man allegedly fled a targeted traffic stop and then attacked the officer.

The new shooting comes a week after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis. More than 2,000 federal agents have been deployed to the city.

Good’s family thanked the public for their support, remembering Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, as a “beautiful light” who “brought joy to anyone she met.”

The Department of Homeland Security has called the operation in Minnesota its biggest to date, with more than 2,400 people having been arrested since it began Nov. 29.

Federal agents have used tear gas and pepper spray in confrontations with residents and protesters as pushback continues to grow in the days following Good's death.

Six people with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over concerns about the direction of the investigation into Good’s death, according to a source familiar with the resignations.

Officials in Minnesota sued the federal government Monday to halt the deployment of thousands of immigration agents to the state.

In video, family frantically pleads for help as they describe man shot by ICE in Minneapolis

In a live video posted to Facebook tonight, members of a family pleaded for help as they described a man who they said was shot in the leg by ICE agents.

The video, recorded from inside a home, showed several people frantically talking in Spanish to what appeared to be 911 dispatchers, one of whom seemed to be translating for the other. The video did not show anyone who appeared wounded.

“Please, help us. We have children,” a man says after several people tell the dispatcher that the person in question had been shot in the leg.

The Department of Homeland Security said tonight that a federal officer had shot a Venezuelan man in the leg after what the agency said was an “ambush.” It was not immediately clear whether the shooting described in the video was the same one referenced by federal and city officials.

NBC News has geolocated the video to the same neighborhood in North Minneapolis, where officials said the shooting occurred. The video was posted around the time of the shooting.

The person who posted the video did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The person filming the video at various points opens the curtains of a window. Red and blue flashing lights from a vehicle can been seen outside.

“They were chasing my husband for about half an hour,” a woman in the video can be heard telling dispatchers. “They were trying to crash into him and he got to the house, and since we closed the door on them, they shot him.”

The woman tells the dispatchers that ICE agents are outside the property, trying to get in.

“Tell them they shot the door,” another woman’s voice can be heard saying. “Son, come. Son, come.”

At least two young children can be seen in the video.

Mayor says ICE is 'creating chaos' but warns against 'taking the bait'

Immigration agents who have flooded the Minneapolis area are ""creating chaos,"" Mayor Jacob Frey said tonight, while also urging peace and warning protesters against ""taking the bait.""

Frey has been critical of federal immigration authorities since the fatal shooting of Good, which sparked national outrage and competing narratives between federal and local officials about what happened.

“I’ve seen conduct from ICE that is disgusting and is intolerable. If it were your city, it would be unacceptable there, too,” he said tonight.

But, as protesters and immigration enforcement once again clashed on the icy streets of Minneapolis, he appealed for calm.

Frey praised peaceful demonstrators while forcefully discouraging violence. The violent protesters, he said, are not helping the cause of immigrants or the residents of the city.

""And for anyone that is taking the bait tonight: Stop. That is not helpful. Go home. We cannot counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos.”

‘This is not sustainable,’ Minneapolis mayor says

The situation in Minneapolis is not sustainable, the city’s mayor said tonight, following another shooting of a civilian by a federal immigration agent.

Mayor Jacob Frey was speaking to reporters as the city, already experiencing unrest following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, was roiled further by the shooting of a man after what federal officials called an “ambush.”

“This is not sustainable. This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in. And at the same time, we are trying to find a way forward to keep people safe, to protect our neighbors, to protect order,” Frey said.

The city’s police force numbers about 600 officers, he said, dwarfed by what he said are about 3,000 immigration officers in the area. The local officers, he said, should be able to focus on police work and responding to day-to-day 911 calls.

He said tonight that residents have been asking local police officers to “fight ICE agents on the streets, to stand by their neighbors.”

“We cannot be at a place right now in America where we have two governmental entities that are literally fighting one another,” Frey said.

Police chief tells protesters to immediately disperse

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara called a protest that erupted in response to the shooting tonight unlawful and called on protesters to immediately disperse.

Protesters have thrown fireworks, rocks and ice at police, he said.

“It is well past the line, and people need to leave,” he said, adding: “This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further.”

Minneapolis police chief says federal agent shot man during a struggle

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a federal agent shot a man tonight during a struggle outside a home north of downtown Minneapolis.

After he was shot, the man retreated into the home and refused to come out, O’Hara said at a news conference.

Eventually federal agents entered the home and the man was taken to a hospital, O’Hara said. The chief described the injury as non life-threatning.

O’Hara said that a person may have assaulted the officer but that he wasn't sure who. The FBI and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension are processing evidence at the scene, he said.

Shooting occurred miles from where Renee Good was killed

The shooting by a federal agent tonight occurred in the 600 block of 24th Avenue North, the city said, roughly 12 miles north of where Good was killed last week.

Minneapolis officials ask for calm after shooting

Minneapolis officials asked for calm after a federal immigration officer shot a man during what federal authorities described as a violent confrontation.

The city said on X that the man was hospitalized with apparently non-life-threatening injuries.

“We understand there is anger,” the city said. “We ask the public to remain calm.”

In a separate post, the city asked federal immigration authorities to leave the city and the state immediately.

""We stand by our immigrant and refugee communities — know that you have our full support,"" the city said.

Trump calls ICE shooting of Renee Good 'sad to see on both sides'

Trump today softened his tone on last week's fatal shooting of Good , calling it ""unfortunate.""

""It's so sad to see on both sides,"" Trump said in an interview with Reuters.

A week earlier, hours after the shooting, Trump said on Truth Social that Good “violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer.”

Asked today whether Ross did the right thing, Trump told Reuters: “I don’t get into right or wrong. I know that it was a tough situation to be in.”

“There was very little respect shown to the police, in this case, the ICE officers,” he added.

Federal officer shoots man in leg after 'ambush' in Minneapolis, DHS says

A federal officer shot a Venezuelan man this evening in Minneapolis after what the Department of Homeland Security described as an “ambush,"" the agency said.

The officer had been conducting a targeted traffic stop at 6:50 p.m. local time when the man left in a vehicle, which crashed into a parked car, and then ran away, the department said in a statement.

As the officer pursued the man, who the department said was in the country illegally, he assaulted the officer, according to the statement.

During the struggle, two people came out of an apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, according to the statement.

The man got loose and also began attacking the officer with a shovel or a broomstick, the department said.

“Fearing for his life and safety as he was being ambushed by three individuals, the officer fired defensive shots to defend his life,” the department said, adding that the man officers had been chasing was shot in the leg.

All three men barricaded themselves in the apartment but were taken into custody, according to the statement.

Both the man who was shot and the officer were hospitalized, the department said. Additional details about the incident were not immediately available.

Tensions grow as crowd gathers after reported shooting in Minneapolis

An angry crowd gathered tonight in a residential area where law enforcement officers were present and temporarily blocking a street.

People blew whistles, yelled expletives and threw snowballs at masked officers, video captured by NBC affiliate KARE of Minneapolis showed.

At one point, the officers could be seen using ""flash bang"" devices and chemical irritants on the protesters, according to the KARE reporter on the scene, and moving a perimeter closer to multiple law enforcement vehicles that had their lights activated.

Minneapolis says it's aware of reports of shooting involving federal law enforcement

The city of Minneapolis said it was aware of reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in North Minneapolis.

The city said on X tonight that it was working to confirm additional details.

Gov. Walz tells people to record 'atrocities' against Minnesotans

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz encouraged people tonight to help create a record of the “atrocities” against Minnesotans by recording immigration agents.

“You have an absolute right to peacefully film ICE agents as they conduct these activities,” he said in a brief address. “Help us create a database of atrocities against Minnesotans, not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.""

Walz cited a social media post in which Trump told Minnesotans not to fear because “THE DAY OF RECONKING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING,” and he pleaded with Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “end this occupation.”

“You’ve done enough,” he said.

ICE officer who shot Renee Good suffered internal bleeding, official says

Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who fatally shot Good in Minneapolis last week, suffered internal bleeding to the torso following the incident, a Department of Homeland Security official said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the officer had been treated at the hospital and released.

6 prosecutors who resigned from state U.S. attorney’s office identified

The six prosecutors who resigned from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Minnesota were identified as Joe Thompson, Melinda Williams, Harry Jacobs, Tom Calhoun Lopez, Ruth Shnider and Tom Hollenhorst, a source familiar with the resignations told NBC News.

Hollenhorst announced last week that he would be retiring, according to the source.

Trump threatens funding for states over 'sanctuary' cities as clashes intensify in Minneapolis

Trump said that he would cut off federal funding next month for any state that includes “sanctuary” cities, expanding his attacks on mostly Democratic-run cities after days of clashes in Minneapolis.

Trump’s vow, which he made on social media, repeated comments he first made in a speech in Detroit yesterday, when he said he would halt payments starting Feb. 1 to any state that had so-called sanctuary cities, which limit local authorities’ cooperation with federal immigration officers.

Any such effort would undoubtedly be challenged in court. A federal judge in August blocked a previous attempt to freeze funding for more than 30 sanctuary jurisdictions unless they cooperated with his immigration crackdown.

Trump’s declaration came amid escalating tensions in Minneapolis, a week after a U.S. immigration officer fatally shot Good, a U.S. citizen, in her car.

Good family hires noted civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci

Good’s family hired civil rights attorney Antonio Romanucci, who said he's dedicated to ""fervently pursuing justice on behalf"" of Good.

“It is always challenging to pursue litigation against state and local law enforcement officers because of the many immunities they are afforded. But legal action against the federal government is even more complex,"" according to a statement by Romanucci, who also represented loved ones of George Floyd, the Minneapolis man murdered by police officer Derek Chauvin in 2020.

""This process will not deter us in any way from fervently pursuing justice on behalf of Renee Good,” he said.

Renee Good's family releases a statement

Good’s family thanked the public for their support today, remembering her as a “beautiful light” who “brought joy to anyone she met.”

“The kind of unending care we’ve been given during this time is exactly the kind that she gave to everyone,” her parents and four siblings said in a statement released through their attorney.

“She was our best friend with a seemingly infinite capacity for love. Nae-Nae gave everything she had to take care of her friends and family, and indeed people she never met,” the statement read. “If there was any celebration for any one of us, Nae amplified it. If there was sorrow, she was with you for all of it. Nae found joy in others being comforted and was herself a fountain of comfort.”

Her family called her their “protector” and said “we feel her absence deeply as we struggle to compose this statement without her gentle guidance.”

“Knowing we can’t match her eloquence, we are remembering Nae in all the little things she’d be doing for us today. She is in the tight hug we offer each other as we lean on the counter,” the family said. “She’s in the goofy cackles we elicit in each other as we recall sweet memories, and she’s in the tears we leave on each others’ shirts. She is in the flow state that comes when your spirit is creating something passionate to share with others. Her voice is the one singing the song stuck in your head. More than anything, she is there when your heart breaks and fills for another person.”

“When we remember Nae, we remember her abundant heart, and we will move forward imitating that unending care,” they concluded.

Joe Rogan criticizes ICE tactics: ‘Are we really going to be the Gestapo?’

Joe Rogan compared ICE to “the Gestapo” in the latest episode of his popular podcast yesterday, openly breaking with Trump on his administration’s immigration enforcement tactics.

Rogan, one of the biggest podcasters in the world, endorsed Trump in the 2024 election just days after he held a three-hour interview with him on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” The show, which has consistently retained its No. 1 spot on the Spotify podcast charts, has more than 20.6 million subscribers on YouTube.

But yesterday, Rogan, who has been increasingly critical of Trump’s mass deportation agenda in recent months, expressed concern over ICE’s activities in an episode featuring Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. He said that “most people” believe law enforcement should arrest criminals but that many of the same people also believe ICE is “operating illegally.”

No immediate court decision on a request to stop the immigration crackdown in Minnesota

A judge made no immediate decision today on Minnesota’s request to suspend the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the state, where federal agents have yanked people from cars and confronted angry bystanders demanding they pack up and leave.

Plumes of tear gas, the deployment of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since an immigration officer fatally shot Good on Jan. 7 as she drove away.

“What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,” state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said at the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case “on the front burner” and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to the request for a restraining order. Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Menendez said the state and cities will have a few more days to respond.

“It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,” she said of the timetable, noting that there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Justice Department attorney Andrew Warden suggested the slower approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

Menendez is also handling a separate lawsuit challenging the tactics used by ICE officers and other federal officers when they encounter protesters and observers. A decision could be released this week.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and vows not to back down. The Defense Department is preparing to send military lawyers to Minneapolis to assist, CNN reported.

“What we see right now is discrimination taking place only on the basis of race: Are you Latino or are you Somali? And then it is indiscriminate thereafter,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told Fox News. “In other words, they are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets, and you don’t need to take my word for it at this point. This has been very well documented.”

The president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota said four tribal members were detained at a homeless camp in Minnesota last week. Three remained in custody late last night.

“Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty,” said tribe President Frank Star Comes Out, who demanded their release.

A week later, the memorial for Renee Nicole Good is still growing

It has been a week since an ICE officer fatally shot Good in Minneapolis, and the memorial to honor her at the scene of the slaying continues to grow.

Flowers, stuffed animals and protest signs continued to pile up and adorn the spot on Portland Avenue between East 33rd and 34th streets where Good was slain by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Minneapolis mayor speaks on ICE, investigation into Renee Good's death

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he doesn’t want to eliminate Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but believes ICE agents should target states that have larger numbers of undocumented immigrants.

“This, however, is the largest immigration enforcement action on record in the United States,” he said in a Wednesday Fox News interview on “Fox & Friends.”

“Why is the largest scale immigration enforcement action taking place where we don’t even have that many undocumented immigrants? Why would it not take place in Texas or Florida or Utah where you do actually have those large numbers of undocumented immigrants,"" he said.

The Mayor continued: “That is where it would make more sense. But again, if the issue is murder or crime, the answer is we do work with the federal government. In fact, we are presently doing that. So the truth is it is not about murder or crime.”

Frey went on to say that there is “discrimination taking place only on the basis of race” in his city.

“Are you Latino or are you Somali? And it is indiscriminate thereafter. They are pulling people off the streets. They have pulled U.S. citizens off the streets,” he said. “If this were about murder or rape or crime or fraud, then, look, we have worked together not just with the Biden administration, with the past Trump administration, with the Bush administration. We have worked with a number of administrations to successfully drive down crime. This is not about that.”

The Mayor, who called for ICE to “get the f— out” of Minneapolis following Renee Good’s death, said he wants there to be a “full and fair investigation” into what happened.

“I may have disagreements with some people that are part of your audience, but I hope that people can trust that I love my city,"" he said. ""We are experiencing an extraordinary comeback. Crime is down in virtually every category in virtually every neighborhood. Small businesses were opening. And this whole chaos that has taken place, yeah it is setting us back.”

DHS says officers were 'forced' to arrest man whose neck they kneeled on in Minneapolis

After a video posted to social media showed ICE officers kneeling on the neck of a man whom they were arresting in Minneapolis, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said they were ""forced"" to make the arrest after the man impeded law enforcement.

The video shows ICE officers yanking a man from his car and dragging him to the ground, while he is kicking his legs in an attempt to wrestle free. Three officers were attempting to handcuff the man, with one officer holding his arms around the man's neck while two others tried to pin him to the ground.

The officer around the man's neck then moves his hands to assist the other two officers in handcuffing the man, and replaces his hands with his knee on the man's head and neck.

DHS said the incident, which took place on Jan. 7, occurred after officers were responding to a distress call from colleagues at the scene who requested backup ""because they were being attacked by agitators."" The spokesperson said that amid the chaos, an officer who ""feared for his life"" fired his weapon in defense.

When officers arrived, ""hundreds of violent rioters swarmed them, assaulted them, and blocked their path,"" DHS said. It added that officers gave commands to the ""violent agitator who was obstructing law enforcement"" to move out of the way, but he refused and DHS said he ""clearly resisted arrest.""

DHS said officers were ""forced to arrest him for impeding law enforcement,"" and that officers used the ""minimum amount of force necessary to gain control of the violent agitator.""

The spokesperson pointed out that the social media video is slowed down at the point at which the office places his knee on the man's neck. DHS said it was actually ""a split second during a violent struggle.""

Oglala Sioux Tribe calls for release of members

The Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota demanded the release of three tribal members who were allegedly taken into custody from a homeless encampment last week by ICE agents agents in Minnesota.

Those captured are ""tribal citizens"" and ""are not aliens,"" according to a tribe statement. The members being held are categorically outside immigration jurisdiction,"" the tribe said.

""This is not a misunderstanding or an enforcement discretion issue,"" tribal President Frank Star Comes Out said. ""This is a treaty violation. Treaties are not optional. Sovereignty is not conditional. Our citizens are not negotiable.""

Representatives for ICE, DHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs could not be immediately reached for comment today.

Stephen Miller claims Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor are guilty of terrorism

Deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Fox News last night that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey — both strident critics of the federal operation — were guilty of terrorism and of inciting violence.

Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty, who along with city and state authorities was shut out of the FBI's investigation of Renee Good's death, said she still hopes to collect enough evidence herself to make her own decision on bringing criminal charges against ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Whether she manages to do that remains to be seen. Without cooperation from the FBI — which has Ross' gun, shell casings and Good's car — Moriarty said she will rely on an online portal she announced last week for the public to submit evidence, and whatever the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shares from the material it collected at the scene before it was booted from the case.

Moriarty, a former public defender who is in the last year of her four-year term as prosecutor and is not running for re-election, said in an interview that she has the legal authority to prosecute a federal officer. No matter where the evidence takes her, her goal is to add transparency to the case, she said. ""We want community members to feel as though there is documentation and perhaps accountability,” Moriarty said.

The federal investigation has already turned divisive, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying in a statement yesterday there was “currently no basis” for the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division to investigate Ross. Several prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation. At least some felt pressure to examine any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions told NBC News. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about cutting out state and local authorities.

Moriarty said she has also asked police in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs for evidence of other types of serious crimes allegedly committed by federal agents.

Federal prosecutors resign over concerns about probe into Minneapolis ICE shooting, source says

At least three prosecutors with the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have resigned over their concerns with the direction of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, a person familiar with the resignations told NBC News yesterday.

The person confirmed the resignations of Joseph Thompson, Melinda Williams and another attorney. The two named attorneys, Thompson and Williams, did not immediately respond to messages from NBC News seeking comment.

The attorneys felt pressure from Justice Department leadership in both Minneapolis and Washington to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation.

Immigration agents deploy tear gas, pepper spray in Minneapolis as confrontations grow

From high school students to elected officials, residents in Minnesota are pushing back against the growing deployment of federal immigration officers in their neighborhoods, leading to days of confrontations and protests.

Resident Neph Sudduth stopped to choke back tears as she witnessed immigration officers roaming around her neighborhood, just a few blocks from the site where an ICE officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good last week, and clashing with protesters.

""They will hurt you for real! They will hurt you for real!"" she shouted at anti-ICE demonstrators, urging them to move away from the officers’ vehicles. Just then, an immigration officer rolled down his window, extended his arm and sprayed a protester point-blank in the face with a chemical agent.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – JANUARY 15, 2026 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12)and Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) reintroduced the Eliminating Bias in Algorithmic Systems (BIAS) Act, legislation to ensure that every federal agency that uses, funds, or oversees artificial intelligence (AI) has a dedicated Office of Civil Rights focused on combating AI-driven bias, discrimination, and related harms.

The bill would require federal agencies to establish or strengthen civil rights offices with staff trained in algorithmic accountability and civil rights enforcement, and to regularly report to Congress on how AI systems are impacting vulnerable communities. These reports would also include recommendations for legislative action to address emerging harms.

“I represent Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania, a region that reflects both our industrial past and the technologies shaping our future. As a growing hub for innovation in Artificial Intelligence, we have a responsibility to make sure AI does not deepen the inequities Black, brown, low-income, and other vulnerable communities already face. AI carries the same biases humans do, and without oversight, those harms will be replicated if not amplified,” said Rep. Lee. ""The Eliminating BIAS Act puts real guardrails in place to demand transparency, accountability, and strong civil rights protections, especially in an age of rampant disinformation and misinformation. I’m proud to partner with Senator Markey to ensure innovation never comes at the cost of our civil rights or human dignity.”

“From housing to health care to public services, AI is increasingly being used to make consequential decisions, diagnoses, recommendations, and predictions that can significantly alter our lives,” said Senator Markey. “As the risks of bias and discrimination in AI systems become more apparent, the federal government must lead by example and protect marginalized communities that face the greatest consequences when AI goes wrong. My Eliminating BIAS Act will ensure that the government has the proper tools, resources, and personnel to protect these communities and mitigate AI’s dangerous effects, while providing Congress with critical information to address algorithmic harms.”

Algorithms are already discriminating against disadvantaged communities in a variety of contexts. For example, companies have used algorithms to exclude(link is external) users of certain gender identities from viewing job advertisements, block(link is external) advertisements for clothing made for people with disabilities, and charge higher interest rates for minorities. In addition, facial recognition technologies have the highest error rates among Black women(link is external). If left unchecked, biased algorithms will further exacerbate discrimination, inequality, and racism.

“Algorithmic systems affect nearly every part of daily life, making decisions about employment, housing, education, health, finance, and so much more. These systems have been shown to repeatedly create biased outcomes that disproportionately harm Black people and other communities of color. Yet, this administration has encouraged rapid adoption of algorithms without regard for civil rights. The Eliminating Bias in Algorithmic Systems Act presents an alternative path where agencies are required to report the harms created by algorithmic systems and ways to mitigate them” said Jina John, Policy Counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

“Common Sense Media applauds Senator Markey for reintroducing the Eliminating BIAS Act,” said Amina Fazlullah, Head of Tech Policy Advocacy at Common Sense Media. “Without intentional choices to prioritize fairness, AI systems will not learn from past mistakes and will continue to replicate historic inequities, putting children, families, and marginalized communities at risk. This bill ensures federal agencies have the expertise, transparency, and oversight needed to identify and address discriminatory algorithms. As AI increasingly influences access to education, healthcare, employment, and housing, strong safeguards are essential to build public trust in how the government uses these technologies.”

“New America's Open Technology Institute is pleased to endorse Senator Markey's and Congresswoman Lee's Eliminating BIAS Act, which requires federal agencies to establish civil rights offices focused on bias, discrimination, and other harms that may arise from the use of algorithms. This proposed legislation centers rights and fairness in the federal government's development, use, and oversight of artificial intelligence tools. Empowering civil rights offices within federal agencies is critical to ensuring that our government uses artificial intelligence in ways that safeguard vulnerable communities and the health of our democracy.” said Prem Trivedi, Director, New America's Open Technology Institute.

“The National Urban League proudly supports the Eliminating BIAS Act—legislation that is long overdue. While AI holds great promise, far too often opaque algorithms reinforce systemic inequities that disproportionately harm Black, Brown, Indigenous, and immigrant communities. By requiring federal agencies to stand up civil rights offices staffed with technologists, mandating transparency to Congress, and establishing a cross agency working group, this bill puts accountability and equity at the heart of the government’s use of AI. Today, our government must lead by example—ensuring that technology uplifts every community,” said Marc H. Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League.

The Eliminating BIAS Act is cosponsored in the Senate by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Adam Schiff (D-Ca.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and in the House of Representatives by Reps.

U.S. Suspends Immigrant Visa Processing for 75 Countries

The U.S. government has announced an indefinite suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries, effective January 21, 2026, as part of a broader immigration enforcement and vetting review. Under the directive, U.S. consular officers are instructed to pause or refuse immigrant visa issuance for affected nationals while the State Department reassesses screening standards and compliance with public charge and security-related requirements. Countries reportedly impacted include Somalia, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Yemen, and others.

The freeze applies specifically to immigrant visas processed abroad and does not impact nonimmigrant visa categories (such as B, F, H, or L visas) or adjustment of status applications filed within the United States. The measure is characterized as temporary, but no end date has been announced, creating uncertainty for applicants awaiting consular processing and for employers sponsoring employees for permanent residence from overseas.

Impact: The suspension of immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries may cause significant delays to green card timelines and consular case processing. Employers should identify affected cases, adjust mobility planning, and closely monitor State Department guidance as the pause continues.

February 2026 Visa Bulletin

The Department of State’s February 2026 Visa Bulletin reflects continued immigrant visa backlogs, with limited movement across most family- and employment-based categories. For employers, the bulletin underscores ongoing challenges in green card timing, particularly for employees chargeable to India and China, and reinforces the need for realistic workforce and retention planning.

In the employment-based categories, EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 for India and China remain unchanged, continuing long wait times with no forward movement. The most notable advancement appears in EB-3 for Rest of World, Mexico, and the Philippines, which moved forward modestly. Other employment-based categories showed little to no change. Family-sponsored categories also remained largely static, with limited movement primarily in select Mexico and Philippines preferences.

February 2026 Visa Bulletin – High-Level Movement Summary

Impact: Teams should monitor Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing closely. USCIS will accept employment-based adjustment filings using the Dates for Filing chart for February 2026, but slow movement and retrogression risk continue, underscoring the need for early sponsorship, careful tracking, and planning for extended nonimmigrant status reliance.

U.S. Visa Bond Requirements

The U.S. Department of State has updated its “Countries Subject to Visa Bonds” list, expanding the pilot program that requires certain visitors to post refundable visa bonds when applying for B-1/B-2 (business/tourist) visas. Under this Temporary Final Rule, consular officers may require applicants from designated countries to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, intended to increase compliance with visa terms and discourage overstays. The bond requirement is determined at the visa interview and is refunded if the traveler departs the U.S. before their authorized stay expires or if admission is denied.

As of January 8, 2026, the list includes 38 countries whose nationals may be subject to visa bond requirements. Many of the additions took effect on January 21, 2026, though some were already in force earlier. Nationals of these countries must post a bond only if directed by a consular officer and must also file DHS Form I-352 to secure the bond.

Impact: The expanded visa bond program may add significant cost and administrative requirements for certain B-1/B-2 travelers, including $5,000–$15,000 bonds, Form I-352 filing, and possible port-of-entry restrictions. Mobility teams should plan for added expense, update travel guidance, and proactively support affected travelers to avoid delays.

DHS Terminates Somalia’s Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

The Department of Homeland Security has announced the termination of TPS for Somalia, with the designation set to expire on March 17, 2026. Somali nationals currently relying on TPS will lose protection from removal and work authorization unless they obtain another lawful immigration status before that date. TPS for Somalia had been in place since 1991 and was most recently extended through March 2026.

DHS stated that the termination follows a review of country conditions and a determination that Somalia no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS, though the decision has drawn criticism and may be subject to legal challenge.

Impact: Somali TPS holders will need to transition to another immigration status to maintain work authorization after March 17, 2026. Employers should identify affected employees, assess alternative status options, and plan for potential workforce impacts while monitoring for possible litigation or policy changes.

Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration Immigration Policy

A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration immigration policy aimed at curtailing temporary legal status for thousands of migrants, ruling that the government’s action violated procedural and legal requirements. The decision stems from a lawsuit challenging the administration’s effort to end certain humanitarian parole or temporary status programs for migrants from multiple countries, which would have affected an estimated 10,000–12,000 individuals who were lawfully residing in the U.S. under family-based parole programs.

The judge’s order prevents the administration from moving forward with the policy pending further litigation, emphasizing that the government failed to provide the legally required notice and justification for terminating status for those individuals. This action represents a broader pattern of judicial checks on executive immigration actions, particularly those involving rollback of existing status programs without standard procedural safeguards.

Impact: The court’s ruling temporarily preserves lawful status and work authorization for affected individuals, avoiding immediate disruption for employers and employees. However, the administration may appeal, and ongoing litigation creates continued uncertainty, underscoring the need for close monitoring and contingency planning for impacted populations.

USCIS Premium Processing Fee Increase

USCIS has announced that premium processing fees will increase effective March 1, 2026, as part of a required biennial inflation adjustment under the USCIS Stabilization Act. The new fees will apply to Form I-907 requests postmarked on or after March 1, 2026, and filings submitted with outdated fees will be rejected. The increase does not affect eligibility, adjudication standards, or processing timelines.

Updated Premium Processing Fees (Effective March 1, 2026):

Impact: For in-house global mobility and immigration teams, the impact is primarily financial and operational. Premium processing is commonly used for time-sensitive cases such as H-1B and L-1 filings, OPT/STEM employment authorization, travel needs, and immigrant petition milestones, and the higher fees should be reflected in 2026 budgets and forecasts. Where possible, employers may consider filing before March 1, 2026 to use the current fee structure, and should update internal processes and coordinate with finance and external counsel to avoid filing errors.

DHS Removes One-Year R-1 Residency Requirement

Effective January 14, 2026, DHS issued an interim final rule eliminating the one-year foreign residency requirement for religious workers seeking to return to the U.S. in R-1 nonimmigrant status after reaching the five-year maximum stay. While R-1 workers must still depart the U.S. upon reaching the five-year limit, they are no longer required to remain abroad for a full year before reapplying for R-1 admission.

The change applies to all R-1 religious workers, including ministers, monks, nuns, and other qualifying religious occupations. DHS noted that severe EB-4 immigrant visa backlogs have left many religious workers unable to transition to permanent residence before exhausting their R-1 time, and the rule is intended to mitigate staffing disruptions caused by visa retrogression. The rule took effect immediately and is subject to a 60-day public comment period.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/News-Digest-Header-1.png,N,,2026-01-15 12:59:44.667773

Washington, D.C. | The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) strongly condemns today’s State Department action freezing visa processing for nationals from 75 countries under an expanded and deeply troubling interpretation of the “public charge” doctrine.

Unlike prior travel bans that relied on overt nationality-based exclusions, this policy weaponizes economic status, health, age, disability, and other personal characteristics to justify widespread visa denials and indefinite processing freezes. Under the new guidance, consular officers are instructed to deny visas based on speculative assessments of whether an individual might rely on public benefits in the future—including considerations such as health conditions, English proficiency, age, weight, or a potential need for long-term medical care.

This approach represents a dangerous escalation. It replaces even the pretense of individualized adjudication with vague, discretionary standards that invite bias, discrimination, and arbitrary decision-making—while disproportionately impacting immigrants from the Global South, including Arab, African, Muslim, and other historically targeted communities.

By framing this mass freeze as a temporary “reassessment” of immigration procedures, the administration has effectively created an indefinite pause on family reunification, employment-based immigration, and lawful pathways to permanent residence for millions of people—without congressional authorization, clear timelines, or meaningful oversight.

ADC rejects the false premise underlying this policy: that immigrants are a burden rather than contributors and that denying entry based on income, health, or age makes the United States safer. These measures do nothing to enhance security. Instead, they institutionalize discrimination, separate families, and erode long-standing civil and human rights protections.

In light of these restrictive measures, we call on the State Department to immediately implement a robust, transparent, and functional waiver process—one that is accessible in practice, adjudicated promptly, and explicitly designed to keep families together. A waiver system that exists only on paper or that depends on unchecked consular discretion is unacceptable.

Family unity and due process are fundamental rights. ADC will continue to challenge discriminatory immigration policies and advocate for a system rooted in dignity, fairness, and equal protection under the law.

The move, which will affect nearly 40 percent of the countries on the globe, impacts only those seeking to immigrate to the U.S. and does not apply to student or tourism visas.

Nonetheless, it’s the latest effort by the Trump administration to curb immigration by pointing to potential use of U.S. safety net programs.

“The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,” the department posted on the social platform X.

“The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.”

The list of 75 countries includes Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Afghanistan, Egypt, Brazil, Russia and Pakistan. The department said it will stop processing visas from these countries on Jan. 21.

“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” the department wrote in a follow-up post on X.

The pause, first reported by Fox News, comes amid the Trump administration’s sweeping efforts to restrict both legal and illegal immigration into the U.S., as well as its probes into social services fraud in Minnesota, which has focused on the Somali American community.

The State Department in November informed visa officers they could deny immigrant visas to those with certain medical conditions if they deem the applicant likely to rely on public benefits should they have medical issues.

That guidance instructed officers to consider both an applicant’s health and overall financial picture when determining whether to issue a visa.

Common conditions like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes were among those on the list.

Beyond limiting immigration, the State Department has also been revoking existing visas, announcing this week that it has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump returned to office a year ago.

During the press conference held ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, national advocates cited growing concerns following the killing of Renee Nicole Good, a mother and U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis, as well as the numerous accounts of indiscriminate abuse and unwarranted deaths seen in other states couched under the guise of federal immigration enforcement operations.

“The abuse of power we have seen over the last year from this administration is unlawful, unacceptable, and un-American,” said UnidosUS president and CEO Janet Murguía. “What the Latino community has experienced in Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and most recently Minneapolis, feels like this administration has declared war on our community and that we are under assault by our own government. That is why this coalition is demanding Congress use its oversight and appropriations power to ensure transparency and to hold the administration accountable.”

In the joint letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the civil right leaders called on Congress to “enact clear, enforceable guardrails that protect constitutional rights, ensure transparency, and curb the abuse of power we see daily across the country.”

As the Trump administration approaches one year in office, the coalition emphasized that Congress has the authority and responsibility to reject unchecked funding for immigration enforcement, warning that last summer’s legislation provided the administration with unprecedented resources, including $170 billion and 10,000 additional ICE agents. This has fueled abuses of power and the weaponization of a broken immigration system, outcomes that could be repeated without meaningful guardrails and oversight.

Leaders also warned that the expansion of detention, surveillance and unaccountable enforcement, paired with inadequate training and oversight, has predictably resulted in fear, racial profiling, due process violations, wrongful detention of U.S. citizens, unsafe detention conditions and expanded surveillance practices that endanger civil liberties.

National civil rights organizations called on Congress to exercise its constitutional oversight authority and include enforceable guardrails in legislation and in FY 2026 appropriations to rein in abuses of power and protect communities:

Congress Should Respond to Unlawful Use of the Military: Prohibit the domestic deployment of military personnel or resources for immigration enforcement or policing, reaffirming long-standing limits on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Protect Communities from Misuse of Power: Ban masked federal agents and require clear identification and body cameras; codify sensitive-location protections for schools, hospitals, courts and places of worship; suspend 287(g) agreements until independent oversight is in place; and ensure arrests and detentions are properly documented and legally authorized.

Restore Due Process: Require judicial warrants for all arrests and detentions, transparent reporting and independent investigations into deaths or wrongful detentions, access to legal counsel and family for detained individuals, and prohibitions on mass detention, dragnet surveillance, and the use of non-immigration data for enforcement purposes.

The organizations stressed that these reforms should apply nationwide and are intended to protect the constitutional rights and safety of all communities while reinforcing Congress’s role in providing oversight of federal immigration enforcement.

The Republican counteroffer? What if we added money for body cameras?

The wide gulf between the two parties presents a major test for Democratic negotiators, who have struggled to determine where to draw the line on ICE funding. Progressives have demanded changes at the agency, after an agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minnesota, seeking measures to bar agents from wearing masks and to require warrants for arrests.

But Democrats are also eager to enact a full-fledged appropriations bill ahead of a Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Doing so would help them place financial restraints on President Donald Trump’s administration — while failing to pass a funding bill would give Trump and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought greater latitude to make spending decisions.

In short, Democrats are in a bind: Support money for ICE and own the tortured politics of funding that organization, or oppose ICE funding and give the administration the power to make all sorts of spending decisions.

Democrats — or, at least, some of them — would support ICE funding if that legislation came with significant restrictions. But instead of actually negotiating on those principles, Republicans are hoping the body cams could be a workaround, as both parties try to avoid a government shutdown at the end of the month.

According to Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev. — chair of the Appropriations subcommittee that controls Homeland Security funding — Republicans want to send Democrats a new offer soon on Homeland Security funding. He told MS NOW that the offer would include more money for body cameras for ICE agents.

Amodei conceded that Democrats have “legitimate concerns” about accountability at ICE, but he said major policy changes are “not under serious consideration.”

Meanwhile, Amodei seemed to think a funding boost for body cameras could give Democrats a chance to claim a small victory. “You can walk away and say, ‘Hey, we moved the needle on the dial,’” Amodei said.

Democrats, however, have been quick to reject the idea.

“ICE has enough money. We’re not giving them any more,” the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., told MS NOW.

Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., agreed.

“I’m not a cheap date, so no,” McGovern told MS NOW. “Not for me. That doesn’t satisfy me.”

Amodei’s pitch falls far short of a demand by members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who took a formal position against any Homeland Security appropriations bill that doesn’t include “meaningful and significant reforms to immigration enforcement practices,” the group said in a statement.

That could include stopping agents from wearing masks, requiring warrants for arrests, an end to the use of private detention facilities and requiring federal officials to share information with state law enforcement, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told reporters.

But Republicans aren’t interested in those proposals.

Hard-line conservatives in the House could support more money for body cameras, but there’s no appetite for restrictions on agents wearing masks, Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told MS NOW.

“As soon as they stop doxing our ICE agents, I’d be willing to discuss that,” Harris said.

Other Democrats have shifted their focus from policy changes to stricter limits on the Trump administration’s ability to move money around unilaterally.

Recommended

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., the top Senate Democrat on the subcommittee that funds the Department of Homeland Security, said he’s seeking stricter constraints on the Trump administration’s ability to shift money from one program to another. He cited the involvement of Homeland Security Investigations in ICE raids and the diversion of funds to pay for the South Florida immigration detention center nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Murphy separately outlined policy changes he’s seeking at ICE, including a requirement for warrants, a ban on masks during enforcement operations and a requirement for Border Patrol officials to stay at the border. When it comes to appropriations talks, though, Murphy said he’s trying to stay realistic.

“I understand I’m not going to get all my complaints solved in the DHS appropriations bill,” Murphy told reporters. “So I’m not trying to write a perfect bill. I’m simply trying to make it as hard as possible for the money to be used for the purposes, for other purposes other than what Congress intends.”

Other negotiators aim to attach policy changes to the funding measure.

Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., the top House Democratic appropriator, told MS NOW that Democrats are “exploring policy riders, looking at the best way to proceed” in the funding negotiations.

DeLauro said the stance held by the Progressive Caucus isn’t a fringe demand. Democrats are united in pushing for changes at ICE as part of funding talks, she said.

“It’s not a wing of the party — this is a uniformity,” DeLauro told MS NOW. “Everyone is so upset about the terrors in their communities. This is widespread. So it’s not a particular caucus.”

Republicans view the whip count differently.

According to Amodei, Republicans were never counting on progressive Democrats to vote for a measure to fund the DHS. And the idea that progressives would support a DHS funding bill only got more farfetched after the shooting of Renee Good in Minnesota.

The Republican offer is meant to be an olive branch to Democrats who are less concerned about major policy changes and more focused on avoiding a full-year continuing resolution, which gives the Trump administration more flexibility to spend money as they wish.

“It sure as hell didn’t help put the bill to bed,” Amodei said of the ICE shooting’s effect on funding negotiations. “But we also realize there are some folks on the D side who were never going to vote for a DHS bill. And it’s like, OK, tell me how you win with a full-year CR.”

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT, which many Presidents have done before me, and quickly put an end to the travesty that is taking place in that once great State,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

His warning came just hours after a federal officer shot a man in the leg after an attempted traffic stop in Minneapolis on Wednesday night. Protests against federal immigration operations exploded after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross earlier this month.

Trump floated using the Insurrection Act several times last year, including in October, citing the need for “safe cities” across the country.

Deploying the military for domestic law enforcement purposes usually requires congressional authorization, but invoking the 19th-century law would permit Trump to do so unilaterally. It also allows for the federalization of National Guard troops under certain circumstances. The law is rarely used. President George H.W. Bush was the last to invoke it, during the Los Angeles riots in 1992.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

A spokesperson for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday, “Minnesota needs ICE to leave, not an escalation that brings additional federal troops beyond the 3,000 already here. The mayor’s priority is keeping local law enforcement focused on public safety, not diverted by federal overreach.”

On Wednesday evening, Walz, a Democrat, said that the presence of ICE officers was no longer “a matter of immigration enforcement.”

“Instead, it’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government,” he said. “Let me say once again to Donald Trump and Kristi Noem — end this occupation. You’ve done enough.”

The Trump administration escalated immigration enforcement in Minneapolis last month after conservative influencers brought new attention to allegations of day care fraud involving Somali immigrants in the region. However, the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families said investigators determined that child care facilities involved in the recent fraud allegations were operating normally.

Trump and his allies have seized on the allegations, publicly attacking both Minnesota Democrats and Somali immigrants. Last month, he accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., the first Somali American to serve in Congress, of being “one of the many scammers.” Omar has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

The Trump administration announced Wednesday that it’s ending temporary protected status for Somalis, saying that those with TPS must leave the U.S. by March 17.

The president has also repeatedly lashed out at Walz, who was the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president.

“Moronic Tim Walz has allowed Minnesota to become overrun by Somali fraudsters who steal from American Taxpayers, and take advantage of our generosity,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Tuesday. “Tim is completely incompetent, which is why he lost big time last year, and bowing out of Re-Election is the only good decision he has ever made.”

Walz announced earlier this month that he was ending his re-election bid for a third term, citing the focus on the fraud allegations, in order to fully focus on the work of being governor.

“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260114-trump-rs-e97865.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 11:58:26.496913

The 2-1 ruling by a panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opened the door to Khalil being re-arrested after it ordered, opens new tab the dismissal of a lawsuit he filed challenging his initial detention.

That holding came from U.S. Circuit Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, both of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, who said that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, his claims needed to be instead heard through an appeal of a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

""The scheme Congress enacted governing immigration proceedings provides Khalil a meaningful forum in which to raise his claims later on—in a petition for review of a final order of removal,"" they wrote in an unsigned opinion.

Khalil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was arrested on March 8 by immigration agents in the lobby of his university residence in Manhattan.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, had called the protests antisemitic and vowed to deport foreign students who took part. Khalil became the first target of this policy.

Though Khalil was initially detained in New York, by the time his lawyer sued over his detention there, immigration officials had moved him to New Jersey, leading his case to be transferred to a judge there.

He walked out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center in June, after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz of Newark, New Jersey, ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to release him from custody.

A three-judge panel of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia instructed the lower court to dismiss Khalil’s habeas petition, a court filing that secured his release. The panel ruled the federal district court in New Jersey did not have jurisdiction over the matter because immigration challenges are handled differently under the law.

In a 2-1 decision, the panel ruled that federal immigration laws require deportation challenges to be made by filing a petition for review of a final order of removal with a federal appeals court — not a lower-level district court.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple—not zero or two,” the panel wrote. “But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”

The law bars Khalil “from attacking his detention and removal in a habeas petition,” the panel added.

“We are disappointed by and strongly disagree with the majority’s opinion, but take heart in the powerful dissenting opinion and will continue to fight against his unlawful persecution and detention through all available legal avenues,” said Khalil’s attorney, Baher Azmy, in a statement to CNN.

The decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel.

An outspoken leader of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia University, Khalil was arrested at his apartment on March 8, 2025. He then spent three months detained in a Louisiana immigration jail, missing the birth of his firstborn son.

Federal officials have accused Khalil of leading activities “aligned to Hamas,” though they have not presented evidence to back up the claim and have not accused him of criminal conduct.

The government has justified the arrest under a seldom-used statute that allows for the expulsion of noncitizens whose beliefs are deemed to pose a threat to US foreign policy interests.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

President Donald Trump’s administration then appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should ultimately fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court. They have also accused Khalil of failing to disclose information on his green card application.

Khalil has dismissed those allegations as “baseless and ridiculous,” framing his arrest and detention as a “direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”

The appeals court decision comes as an appeals board in the immigration court system is weighing a previous order from an immigration judge that found Khalil could be deported. His attorneys have argued that the federal order should take precedence.

That judge has suggested that Khalil could be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

His attorneys have said he would face mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-ap26015521561946.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-15 11:59:01.277115

While most of the bills have been introduced in Democrat states (Alaska, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Washington) Republican-controlled states of Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee also have proposed legislation.

Legislators are not the only ones to jump into the fray to oppose ICE agents in their states. Twenty-one democrat state attorney generals (AGs) sent a letter to Members of Congress urging them to pass legislation to prohibit immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity. In their letter they claimed that ICE agents wearing masks “have the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.” These AGs further contend that “the commonplace use of masks and the failure of ICE to identify themselves as law enforcement makes everyone less safe and weakens the integrity of our justice systems.”

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) justifiably says that these legislative bans “stoke dangerous rhetoric against ICE agents.” In a January 8 statement released by DHS, the agency pointed out that ICE officers now face “a more than 1,300% increase in assaults, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats.”

California was the first, and so far, the only state to pass legislation prohibiting masking. The legislature passed the No Secret Police Act, Senate Bill (SB) 627 which Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law on September 20.

On November 17, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit to block the implementation of California’s law which was set to go into effect on January 1, 2026, but was paused to allow the court to hear arguments in the case on January 14. In its complaint, DOJ asserted that the law violates the Supremacy clause by attempting to regulate federal agencies and forcing them to adopt certain policies. The complaint also stated that the federal government will not comply with this unconstitutional law that “recklessly disregards officers’ safety and federal operational needs.”",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/ICE-agents-wearing-masks-in-camo-ICE-flickr.jpg.webp?itok=eLQy3LWD,N,,2026-01-15 11:00:11.664183

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House.

“She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”

On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country.

The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.

A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities.

A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December.

Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district.

“We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”

Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action.

In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies.

Now, we're telling the story of the first year of our fight against the Trump administration’s second term, our lessons learned, and our path forward.

We were prepared for this fight from day one.

Before President Trump was elected, we examined his campaign promises — including those outlined in Project 2025 — and outlined a plan for how we would fight to protect the rights and liberties of all people. We spent months plotting out our litigation and advocacy strategy across the country, building a plan to ensure that cities and states would be a Firewall for Freedom — a shield defending against a federal government attacking civil rights and civil liberties.

Within hours of President Trump's inauguration, it was clear that he and his administration would, once again, test the Constitution and the willingness of our nation’s institutions and people to defend it. But we were ready. The ACLU mobilized our lawyers, advocates, organizers, storytellers, and supporters to delay unconstitutional policies before they took effect, dilute their reach when full blockage wasn’t immediately possible, and defeat them through courts, public pressure, and sustained organizing. In 2025, we took over 230 legal actions against the Trump administration, with remarkable success: 64% of our lawsuits have delayed, diluted, or defeated the Trump administration’s agenda.

But despite everything we’ve accomplished so far, we cannot underestimate the continued speed and ferocity of this assault on civil rights and civil liberties or the impact it will continue to have on us all. And as we enter 2026, the stakes feel as high as ever.

Some types of human rights were uniquely politicized and singled out in 2025, including women’s rights and environmental rights.
The Human Rights Funders Network of almost 450 institutions across 70 countries estimates that by 2026, human rights funding globally will experience a $1.9 billion reduction compared to levels in 2023.
As many governments pull back and even attack human rights, the work of human rights defenders and organizations will become more critical than ever.
Many work at the community level, alongside neighbors and friends, with human rights defenders networks around the world, from the Mozambique Human Rights Defenders Network to Somos Defensores in Colombia.","The year 2025 was difficult for human rights and human rights defenders.

Unceasing attacks came from governments, including the most powerful, as well as from the private sector and non-state groups, pushing agendas in opposition to human rights. Many of these assaults are amped up by technology, with the methods and means becoming ever cheaper and ever more accessible to the masses.

An annual analysis from the Dublin-based international rights group Frontline Defenders paints a devastating picture of killings, arbitrary detention, surveillance, and harassment. CIVICUS, an organization that measures civic space (defined as “the respect in policy, law and practice for freedoms of association, expression and peaceful assembly and the extent to which states protect these fundamental rights”), documented declines in 15 countries and improvements in only three. The location and nature of the drops were diverse, taking place from mature democracies such as the United States, Germany, France, and Switzerland, to authoritarian regimes such as Burundi and Oman, and including countries in crisis and conflict such as Sudan and Israel. Some types of human rights were uniquely politicized and singled out in 2025, including women’s rights and environmental rights. Freedom House recorded the 19th straight year of declines in global freedom.

All this is compounded by an unprecedented slash-and-burn to international aid budgets for organizations and individuals working on human rights worldwide. The Human Rights Funders Network of almost 450 institutions across 70 countries estimates that by 2026, human rights funding globally will experience a $1.9 billion reduction compared to levels in 2023.

Taken together, this makes the world more dangerous than ever for human rights defenders and they have fewer resources at their disposal to combat the threats.

In 2026 and moving forward, two crucial questions arise for the defense of human rights globally. First, who will do the work of fighting to protect and advance human rights in the year ahead, and second, how can those in the international community still fiercely committed to human rights support them? These questions will be shadowed by another trend: impunity. Yet, at the same time, lessons and a few positive developments from 2025 can guide human rights defenders on how to seize opportunities in the coming year, beginning even this month at the United Nations.

The Earthquakes of 2025

Eviscerating Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance Assistance

In the United States, 2025 began with the newly inaugurated Trump administration dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and canceling approximately 85 percent of its programming (from a budget of more than $35 billion in the fiscal year ending in September 2024). The gutting eliminated hundreds of millions of dollars of support for those working to protect human rights and expand freedom and democracy around the world. The State Department’s grantmaking efforts were similarly cut, with more than half of its awards canceled, including programs directly supporting human rights defenders such as one initiative providing emergency financial assistance to civil society organizations and a fund to promote human rights and democracy and respond to related crises.

Most other major donor countries followed suit, though not with the same sweep or to nearly the same degree. Canada said it would reduce foreign aid by $2.7 billion over the next four years, the Dutch announced structural spending cuts of € 2.4 billion on development aid starting in 2027, and the European Union announced a €2 billion reduction in its main mechanism for development aid for 2025-2027. Multilateral funders were not immune to the trend: the United Nations, for one, will see major budget and staffing cuts for human rights in 2026.

The U.S. retreat from foreign assistance rapidly impacted all development sectors, from health, to education, to humanitarian assistance, but no sector was targeted with such enmity as that of democracy, human rights, and governance. Advocates and implementers saw not only the dire resource clawbacks discussed above, but also found themselves tarred by a steady diet of derisive commentary from the very policymakers doing the cutting.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who, once championed human rights and democracy “activists” as a U.S. Senator, even serving on the board of the democracy-promoting International Republican Institute before the administration eliminated the congressional funding that supported it. He once told a crowd at the Brookings Institution “[f]oreign aid is a very cost-effective way, not only to export our values and our example, but to advance our security and our economic interests.”

But as secretary of state, he abruptly reversed course, writing last April that the State Department unit overseeing civilian security, human rights, and democracy had “a bloated budget and unclear mandate,” and that its “Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor had become a platform for left-wing activists to wage vendettas against `anti-woke’ leaders in nations such as Poland, Hungary.” Other members of the administration were similarly sharp-tongued about the sector, with now-former USAID Administrator Pete Marocco conflating the promotion of “civic society” with “regime change” in official court documents and President Donald Trump himself referring to USAID’s leadership as “radical lunatics.”

The rhetoric mirrors similar language used by authoritarians across the globe who have long been opposed to foreign assistance for democracy, human rights, and governance work, and it has real-world consequences for those advocating for human rights and freedom. Leaders of multiple countries have seized on the words of the Trump administration to launch spurious investigations of human rights defenders and other civil society activists who had received U.S. funding.

Closing Civic Space and New Technology

Closing civic space is not a new threat to human rights defenders, but it is one that has reached a fevered pitch in the last few years. This has included both an increase in traditional attacks and a greater reliance on new tactics for suppression, especially in the digital sphere.

Nearly 45 percent of all civic space violations CIVICUS recorded for its annual analysis were related to the freedom of expression. The organization documented more than 900 violations of the right to peaceful assembly and more than 800 violations of freedom of association. The most frequent examples were detentions of protesters and journalists, followed by the detention of human rights defenders outside the context of a protest or journalism, merely for doing their work.

Authoritarian regimes also have become ever more adept at utilizing the digital space for repression. Tactics such as doxing, censorship, smearing, and online harassment are important tools in an authoritarian approach. They have been supplemented in recent years by less evident tactics such as shadow-banning, which the CIVICUS analysis defined as when “a platform restricts content visibility without notifying the user,” allowing the platform to maintain an appearance that it is neutral.

Women rights defenders face additional risks online, including technology-facilitated gender-based violence: In a global survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 38 percent of women reported personal experience with violence online, from hacking and stalking to image-based sexual abuse.

Attacks in the digital space often are also connected with or fuel physical attacks, “including killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and harassment,” as Frontline Defenders reported in its analysis. Tunisia is paradigmatic. Amnesty International reported that, beginning in 2024, a “wave of arrests followed a large-scale online campaign…which saw homophobic and transphobic hate speech and discriminatory rhetoric against LGBTI activists and organizations spreading across hundreds of social media pages, including those espousing support for the Tunisian President Kais Said. Traditional media outlets also broadcast inflammatory messages by popular TV and radio hosts attacking LGBTI organizations, calling for their dissolution and for the arrests of LGBTI activists.”

What to Expect for Human Rights in 2026

The absence of meaningful and unified international pushback to human rights abuses by some of the world’s most powerful nations means the rights-based international system will continue to face unprecedented attacks, and the challenges that rights defenders face in the year ahead are likely to increase in number and intensity. Authoritarians worldwide have monitored the assault against human rights in the past year — from genocide in Gaza to the crackdowns on protesters in Tanzania to restrictions on freedom of association and expression in El Salvador and so many more instances — and they have learned that they are unlikely to be held accountable internationally in the near term.

Yet despite these challenges, a few developments in 2025 offer some reasons for optimism in the year ahead. Several large-scale, youth-led movements in 2025 held their governments accountable for rights violations, from the July Revolution in Bangladesh that ousted an abusive prime minister to the Gen Z protests in Kenya over economic conditions and government corruption, a protest moniker that spread to other countries as well.

Some governments passed rights-protecting laws, from Thailand’s legalization of same-sex marriage to Colombia’s laws preventing child marriage. Courts stood up for human rights and held perpetrators to account, from the International Criminal Court’s conviction of Sudan’s Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for war crimes and crimes against humanity to the U.S. conviction of The Gambia’s Michael Saang Correa for torture, to the symbolic judgment of the People’s Tribunal for Women of Afghanistan. These trends are likely to continue in 2026, despite the challenges, because courageous human rights defenders are using every avenue to fight for rights.

This year will also bring targeted opportunities to continue the fight for human rights. A preparatory committee for a proposed international crimes against humanity treaty begins work this month at the United Nations. Also at the U.N., this year’s Universal Periodic Reviews, a regular peer review of countries’ human rights records, will focus on some of the world’s worst rights offenders — including Sudan, Eswatini, and Rwanda — as well as countries with highly mixed records. These reviews provide an opportunity for the world to examine, publicly and critically, the rights records of all 193 countries and for victims and activists to share their stories and insights. While the United States has not submitted its self-evaluation due late last year, the process continued with the usual submissions from the U.N. and others.

Creative activists also are likely to use prominent events, such as the 2026 Olympic Games, to push for the expansion and recognition of human rights. They can take the opportunity of the United States’ 250th anniversary celebrations to highlight and internationalize the country’s founding principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the requirement that all governments “[derive] their just powers from the consent of the governed.”

Who Will Lead the Fight for Human Rights in 2026?

As many governments pull back and even attack human rights, the work of human rights defenders and organizations will become more critical than ever. Some of them have been leading the fight for decades, including leading international NGOs, national organizations, networks, and prominent individual leaders. Others have done critical human rights work but haven’t labeled themselves as rights defenders, such as organizations providing access to clean water, supporting girls’ education, or working to prevent violent conflict.

Many work at the community level, alongside neighbors and friends, with human rights defenders networks around the world, from the Mozambique Human Rights Defenders Network to Somos Defensores in Colombia. Some are in exile, fighting for rights in their home countries and for refugee and diaspora communities, like the brave Afghan women who organized a landmark People’s Tribunal in 2025 to expose rights violations against women. Others are professionals whose skills directly relate to human rights — lawyers, judges, journalists, and more. They include people like the brave journalists who continue to report on the context in Gaza, despite the incredible risks, and the Burmese lawyers who continue to document rights violations. Some are individual activists, using their platforms and skills to protect rights and call attention to attacks against them, like Iranian Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi who was recently detained alongside other rights defenders while attending a memorial service for a human rights lawyer. Some are informal coalitions, student and youth groups, or protest participants — social movements have been and will be an essential component of the fight for human rights. All of these actors play a critical role in the human rights ecosystem. All of them are human rights defenders.

Aid funding cuts have devastated civil society organizations and will continue to impact human rights advocates. A survey by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems and International IDEA of 125 civil society organizations based in 42 countries found that 84 percent of respondents had lost funding due to U.S. and other countries’ aid cuts, with the same number expecting further cuts in 2026. UN Women reported that more than one in three women’s rights and civil society organizations have suspended or shut down programs to end violence against women and girls and more than 40 percent have scaled back or closed life-saving services. The philanthropic organization Humanity United found that 44 percent of peacebuilding organizations that it surveyed would run out of funds by the end of 2025.

These cuts will only be amplified as time goes on, as fewer young people can become human rights professionals while managing to put food on the table, as legal cases that take years to process aren’t filed for lack of funding, as human rights abuses aren’t documented, as the attacks from authoritarian regimes go unchecked. Shrinking development budgets will no longer provide similar levels of support to courts and anti-corruption bodies that human rights defenders have traditionally approached to pursue justice or for support hotlines where ordinary people can call in anonymously to report abuses at the hands of security forces. Such foreign assistance enabled vital avenues of accountability, but also signified solidarity, that at least some political decisionmakers both at home and abroad believed in human rights and supported those working to deepen and protect them.

But despite the myriad challenges, there will be human rights defenders who continue to fight the fight. For many, changes in funding or the withdrawal of political top-cover won’t stop them from finding avenues. One need only look at Iran’s protests today, where thousands of people are exercising and demanding their human rights amidst a brutal crackdown, internet blackout, and without international funding. Rights defenders have been doing a lot with a little for many years. Some — especially women, youth, Indigenous people, and disabled defenders — have often been excluded from human rights funding and support in the past. A new generation has seen the horrors of Gaza, El-Fasher, eastern Ukraine, or even around the corner from their home, in the news and online, and they have committed themselves to social justice and the prevention of atrocities.

Human rights has always been a universal endeavor which has required diverse supporters, advocates, and allies – this is true now more than ever.

How Can the International Community Support?

Even those governments and institutions that continue to lead in supporting human rights internationally will need to do more with less, as the above-outlined cuts exemplify, to support those on the front lines. This is the chance to shift “localization” – the practice of funding local civil society organizations directly and based on their priorities, rather than via large overhead-requiring NGOs funded by donor countries — from an ideal to a necessary strategy. A grant of $20,000 may not keep a major international organization online, but it can fund a community-based service provider. Donors can integrate a rights-based approach across portfolios instead of siloing the issue, integrating human rights goals and strategies into other foreign policy initiatives. For example, companies can integrate human rights efforts and measurements into their supply chains for products from batteries to chocolate, producing products they would already produce but in a way that advances human rights as well. Military operations can add human rights and gender considerations with little cost but potentially huge impact. This requires training, tools, and high-level political will to succeed. And they can continue to advocate for rights and use diplomatic pressure and support as key tools.

The elephant in the room is the United States. The Trump administration not only is backtracking on the traditional U.S. commitment and values of democracy and human rights internally and internationally but also has sought to hamper others in funding such initiatives. But there are still important steps that can be taken to protect human rights. Congress must do its job and provide oversight, holding the administration accountable to the laws that protect this important work. Members should speak out against injustices and rights violations, at home and abroad. Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), for example, has played a key role in the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, calling out rights abuses in places like Turkey, and Rep. Tim Kennedy (D-NY) led a congressional letter to the Department of Homeland Security urging the Trump administration to overturn its decision to terminate Temporary Protective Status for Burmese people. State governments have always played a key role in advancing rights, and this will become more critical than ever.

Foreign governments that have engaged on human rights issues but haven’t been the largest international donors or advocates will be particularly important. Some of them are stepping up already. Examples include Japan playing a leading role in advancing women’s issues, South Africa and Gambia taking cases to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel and Myanmar, respectively, of violating the Genocide Convention, and Ireland continuing its steadfast allyship with human rights defenders.

Now is the time for committed countries around the world to continue to demonstrate the global nature of this agenda, set out more than 75 years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reinvigorated by 18 international human rights treaties.

Philanthropy and the international private sector will be more essential than ever in 2026. Foundations cannot offset the huge funding gaps left by governments and multilateral donors — total U.S. philanthropic giving is about $6 billion per year, whereas U.S. overseas development assistance alone in 2023 accounted for $223 billion — but they can provide strategic investments that help protect rights and those defending them, amplify their voices, fund innovative new approaches, and help the ecosystem survive. Philanthropies around the world provided nearly $5 billion in human rights support globally in 2020 alone, and their funding is critical for many organizations.

Companies have their own role to play, one that includes but goes well beyond corporate social responsibility, from responsible tech and AI to eliminating forced labor from supply chains to hiring diverse employees. The private sector has a unique opportunity to ensure that human rights remain on the global agenda, because there is a strong business case in favor of human rights protections and alliances with those who truly understand the needs and wants of local populations. A great example is the effort by numerous auto and electronics companies to move away from cobalt batteries, both a recognition of the horrible rights violations facing individuals and communities around cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo and a recognition that this move is also better for business due to supply chain volatility.

Defending against challenges to human rights, democracy, and good governance in 2026 and beyond will require creativity and broad coalition-building across sectors that too often are siloed, such as health, peacebuilding, humanitarian assistance, and the field of democracy, human rights, and governance. Everyone who does not traditionally think of themselves as a human rights defender, from government officials to the private sector, will need to step up to support those on the frontlines of the fight to defend human rights.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2233982389.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:35.435549

Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, citing the secretary’s handling of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
“She needs to be held accountable for her actions.” The first impeachment article alleges Noem denied Kelly and other members of Congress “oversight of ICE detention facilities,” the congresswoman said at her presser.
“Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok,” Kelly said at the press conference Wednesday.
“Families are forever torn apart.” “I want to tell her right now: Secretary Noem, you have violated your oath of office, and there will be consequences.
“We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”","Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) on Wednesday introduced articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, citing the secretary’s handling of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.

At a press conference on Wednesday, Kelly outlined three impeachment articles against the secretary, accusing Noem of obstruction of Congress, “violation of public trust” and “self-dealing.”

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, L.A., New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham, and communities north to south to east to west,” Kelly said at the press conference. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions.”

The first impeachment article alleges Noem denied Kelly and other members of Congress “oversight of ICE detention facilities,” the congresswoman said at her presser.

Kelly explained the second article, which accuses Noem of violating public trust, by saying Noem “directed DHS agents to arrest people without warrants, use tear gas against citizens, and ignore due process.”

Kelly said Noem frequently says “she’s taking murderers and rapists off our streets, but none of the 614 people arrested during Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago has been charged or convicted of murder or rape.”

On the third impeachment article, which accuses the secretary of self-dealing, Kelly said Noem “abused her power for personal benefit,” and “steered a federal contract to a new firm run by a friend.”

Kelly, who is running for the Senate in Illinois, announced her intention to file the impeachment articles last week, after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis.

“Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok,” Kelly said at the press conference Wednesday. “Families are forever torn apart.”

“I want to tell her right now: Secretary Noem, you have violated your oath of office, and there will be consequences. I am watching you, members of Congress are watching you, the American people most importantly are watching you. And most of all, we are not liking what we’re seeing,” Kelly said.

While the effort is unlikely to go anywhere in the GOP-controled House, the congresswoman said that as of Wednesday morning the measure has the support of almost 70 members of Congress, and she expects more to sign on.

“We’re trying to build more sponsors of the legislation,” she said, when asked at the press conference if she expects to get a majority of House Democrats on board. “I mean, people joined on quickly when I put it out there, people contacted me almost immediately, and it’s been growing and growing as people find out about it.”

She said she has spoken to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) about the effort but would not say directly whether he supports it.

“You’ll have to answer to Jeffries, but I would not be standing here if I was told not to,” she said.

Former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas last year became the first Cabinet official in recent history to be impeached by the House when Republicans secured a narrow 214-213 vote.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) brushed off the impeachment effort as “silly.”

“How silly during a serious time. As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Hill.

“We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/kellyrobin_011426gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:17.825063

Janet Mills and Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), released statements Wednesday warning U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents could move into the communities soon.

Neither cities nor Mills have confirmed where they are hearing about the possible ICE activity.

Mills addressed the possibility of federal law enforcement operations in Maine in a video statement Wednesday evening.

She said her administration has tried unsuccessfully to confirm whether any operations are planned, but is coordinating with municipalities, including Portland and Lewiston, along with law enforcement, to prepare.

""I have directed the Maine State Police to work closely with local law enforcement, as necessary, to provide whatever support is needed in advance of and during any potential federal operations,” Mills said. “If they come here, I want any federal agents – and the President of the United States – to know what this state stands for. We stand for the rule of law. We oppose violence. We stand for peaceful protest. We stand for compassion, for integrity and justice.""

Mills urged anyone considering protesting to do so peacefully.

""For those of you who may consider protesting, I fully support your right to do so, and I urge you to do so peacefully – to meet any hostility with reserve and resolve,"" Mills said. ""Know this: Maine will not be intimidated, and we will not betray the values that make us who we are.""

""For reasons of operational security and officer safety, ICE does not comment on any ongoing, upcoming or potential operations,"" an ICE spokesperson told NEWS CENTER Maine.

Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline, Portland Mayor Mark Dion, and King also released statements Wednesday about the possibility of ICE agents coming to Maine.

From Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline:

It’s my understanding that there will be ICE enforcement in Lewiston soon. I urge residents and businesses to know their rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops them in the street, visits their home, or visits their business. As a reminder, Lewiston Police do not enforce federal law.

I understand that this is an unsettling time for many of our residents. Lewiston is a strong city and we care about our community and each other. Please check on your neighbors and stay safe.

From Portland Mayor Mark Dion:

Our community is anxious and fearful regarding the understanding that ICE is planning to send agents to Portland and Lewiston next week. We are a welcoming city. There is no evidence of unchecked criminal activity in our community requiring a disproportionate presence of federal agents. In that view, Portland rejects the need for the deployment of ICE agents into our neighborhoods. While we respect the law, we challenge the need for a paramilitary approach to the enforcement of federal statutes. The consequence of law enforcement should not be chaos and violence, which only results in making Portland less safe.

The City Council and I stand, not apart, but with our lawfully admitted immigrant and refugee communities. I urge our residents to look out for one another. Know your rights and have a plan of action if ICE stops you on the street, visits your home, or arrives at your business or place of employment. As a reminder, Portland Police does not cooperate with ICE and they do not participate in enforcing federal immigration law. If you decide to protest or demonstrate, keep your efforts peaceful and consistent with the expectations for lawful behavior that we all share.

NEWS CENTER Maine is still working to independently confirm the mayors’ and the governor’s statements regarding potential federal operations in Maine.

From Sen. Angus King:

Like many in Maine, I have begun to hear rumors of imminent federal law enforcement activities coming to our state. Given the videos and headlines we have seen from operations conducted in other states – many of them reckless, heartless, and irreversibly destructive – I share the same worries many of you have.

Maine believes in law and order. We enjoy that order because our state and local law enforcement authorities place a priority on lawful and timely responses to clear criminal threats.

Abraham Lincoln once reminded Americans in the face of conflict to have faith that ‘right makes might, and in that faith let us do our duty as we understand that.’ In the days ahead, I want to encourage everyone to look out a little closer for one another and be mindful of the rights that our Constitution gives to every man, woman, and child in this nation. If you witness any lawlessness done cloaked in the cause of federal law enforcement, please alert your local leaders, state officials, and federal delegation.

Much of the country was not paying attention to Minnesota before Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent last week.
But with this big surge in ICE agents arriving, they’ve kind of changed tactics.","When Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer last week in Minnesota, it brought attention to the robust effort to combat US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Twin Cities. Residents of Minneapolis and the surrounding areas are joining decentralized networks of activists who are committed to alerting their neighbors to ICE presence on their blocks.

Madison McVan, a reporter for the Minnesota Reformer, rode along with some of those activists to observe their tactics. The activists patrol their neighborhoods looking for ICE officers. When they find them, they alert their networks and tail the officers so their neighbors know where ICE is in the city. These patrols have led to tense standoffs with ICE officers and have drawn accusations of “domestic terrorism” from the Trump administration.

McVan spoke with Today, Explained co-host Noel King about what she experienced while riding along with activists and how these networks sprang up in the first place. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

There’s much more in the full podcast. So listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You’ve been riding along with Minneapolis residents who are tailing ICE as a form of resistance. What’s that been like?

It’s been intense. The idea is that if residents follow ICE and record them, that they can possibly prevent arrest from taking place at all.

Key takeaways

Minnesotans are following ICE vehicles in the Twin Cities and alerting their neighbors that officers may be in the area.

Since Renee Good’s killing, the activists have shown more resolve and their numbers have increased.

ICE has responded by trying to intimidate the activists, driving to their homes and telling them they could be arrested for obstructing their operations.

And is it working?

The people I rode along with think it is working. They basically say if we follow ICE and we record them, they’re a lot less likely to get out of their cars and start asking people for their citizenship documentation and that kind of thing.

Tell me what you’ve experienced when you’ve been in the car with these people.

There’s usually one person driving and then a second person manning the phones. And so the passenger is following along with a group chat. They’re on a group call with other people in the neighborhood who are doing the same thing, so they can correspond about where they’re seeing ICE and notify each other when someone finds ICE and starts following the vehicle.

This kind of plays out [in] a pattern that I’ve seen over and over now, which is that the observers start following an ICE vehicle. The ICE vehicle identifies themselves as federal officers by checking to see if they’re being followed. They turn into a side street or they do an aggressive maneuver, or they start weaving through parking lots — seeming to make sure they’re being followed. And then at some point they stop the vehicle, the observers stop behind them, the ICE agents get out of the car, surround the vehicle, and tell the observers to stop following them — that they’re obstructing ICE operations and that they may be arrested if they continue following.

When I was riding along with a pair of observers, they were following an ICE vehicle, and that exact thing happened. ICE officers got out of their vehicles, they surrounded the car, and one officer told the driver, stop following us or we’ll arrest you. The observers decided to continue following the car, and the ICE vehicle drove straight to the address of one of the observers that was in the car. So it seemed like they were doing some kind of, looking up of the identity of the person who owned the vehicle and then driving to their home address.

The ICE vehicles stopped at the observer’s home and then kept going, and so the observers decided to continue following the vehicles. Two of the vehicles in the convoys split up and the observers decided to follow the third ICE car. As they were following that third ICE car, agents circled back to the observer’s house that they had just stopped in front of and went and banged on the door. The observer’s wife was home. She was terrified and she pretended she wasn’t home, and neighbors started coming out of their houses. Once they realized ICE was next door, [they started] blowing whistles, some people stopped and honked horns, and eventually the agents left.

Much of the country was not paying attention to Minnesota before Renee Good was killed by an ICE agent last week. Was this going on before that?

There was an immigration enforcement surge starting in December, so that was when patrols really started ramping up. But even before that, people were organized in rapid response networks and starting when Trump took over for his second term.

The idea behind the rapid response networks was that if we see an ICE action taking place, we can notify a bunch of people in the neighborhood, and the neighbors can respond to film ICE to inform people of their rights and to protest. But with this big surge in ICE agents arriving, they’ve kind of changed tactics. It seems like now the ICE agents are traveling in smaller groups; they’re conducting arrests quickly. They’re really trying to get in and out before people have time to respond en masse and start protesting. That’s why the rapid response networks have shifted more towards a proactive approach, following ICE agents in hopes of preventing raids or arrests before they even happen.

The Trump administration has suggested that the people doing this are organized activists who have, I don’t know, possibly mendacious goals. Tell me about them, though. Who are these people? How did they get organized?

Well, I think this is where it’s relevant to mention that Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd less than a mile from where an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good. So this neighborhood has been organized before. They’ve mobilized en masse against police brutality before. So I think that there’s already a culture — particularly in the south side of Minneapolis — of organization and protest.

“I think the killing of Renee Good has really only strengthened the resolve of a lot of the people who are already involved in this, and it’s driven more people to try to join the movement.”

The people who are doing this come from all walks of life. We’re seeing churches get involved in this. We’re seeing parents organize with people whose children go to the same schools, so that they can be standing outside during dismissal or so that they can escort immigrant parents when they’re dropping off their children at school. It’s people who have a lot of time and identify as activists, and it’s also people who are commuting to work in the suburbs saying, “Let me take a different route today to see if I spot ICE, and I’ll let you know if I see anything.”

Do you know if Renee Good was one of these people?

We don’t know the details of her involvement in any of these networks. The people I talked to who lived in her neighborhood, who were involved in some of these rapid response groups, said they did not know her. But it’s important to note that it’s possible she could have been in the group and they wouldn’t have known, because everyone uses anonymous nicknames. It’s possible she was there using an anonymous nickname, but I haven’t seen any evidence of that yet.

After Renee Good was killed by the ICE agent, it has seemed like things in Minneapolis have become pretty chaotic. How have these people changed their tactics since she was killed? Are they doing anything differently?

I think the killing of Renee Good has really only strengthened the resolve of a lot of the people who are already involved in this, and it’s driven more people to try to join the movement. I think a lot of people who are protesting ICE or who are going out on patrols are asking themselves what they’re willing to risk for this movement, knowing that someone was shot while protesting ICE.

You’re a journalist, so of course you’re sort of looking at all sides of this debate in Minneapolis. What do you make of the argument from ICE agents that this is threatening — that people following them in cars feels like a threat and that it shouldn’t be happening?

Well, I think that’s part of the point. I think the people on the ground here, many of them feel that this is an occupied city, and they want to show that they’re unhappy with that. They want to try to disrupt ICE operations within the bounds of the law to protect their immigrant neighbors. That’s how they see it. So I’m not surprised that ICE agents feel threatened by this. I think that’s part of the goal.

That’s very interesting, because as you know, the Trump administration has tried to paint Renee Good and others like her as a danger to the city itself. Kristi Noem called Renee Good a “domestic terrorist”. Vice President JD Vance has called this “classic terrorism.”

How do you make sense of statements like that based on what you’re seeing and the activists who are doing this kind of work?

I think it’s important to remember that at least the activists I’ve been with are committed to doing this within the bounds of the law. So it’s really this gray area between what’s considered obstruction in a legal sense and what is practically obstruction of ICE’s work. Honking horns and following them is not physically blocking them from making an arrest, but it certainly discourages them from doing so. That’s kind of where a lot of the action is happening.

And when it comes to Renee Good, it’s unclear what exactly her involvement may have been in any kind of organized movement to protest.

The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.
“They now have to bring them back to FLETC,” said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.
ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency’s vetting process, NBC News has reported.
In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement was racing to add 10,000 new officers to its force, an artificial intelligence error in how their applications were processed sent many new recruits into field offices without proper training, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the error.

The AI tool used by ICE was tasked with looking for potential applicants with law enforcement experience to be placed into the agency’s “LEO program” — short for law enforcement officer — for new recruits who are already law enforcement officers. It requires four weeks of online training.

Applicants without law enforcement backgrounds are required to take an eight-week in-person course at ICE’s academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, which includes courses in immigration law and handling a gun, as well as physical fitness tests.

“They were using AI to scan résumés and found out a bunch of the people who were LEOs weren’t LEOs,” one of the officials said.

The officials said the AI tool sent people with the word “officer” on their résumés to the shorter four-week online training — for example, a “compliance officer” or people who said they aspired to be ICE officers.

The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.

Both law enforcement officials noted that ICE’s field offices provide more training beyond what is provided at the academy or in the online course before officers are sent out onto the street and that the officers singled out by the AI tool most likely received that training. The officials weren’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t respond to a request for comment. The AI mistake was identified in mid-fall — over a month into the recruitment surge — and ICE immediately began taking steps to remedy the situation, including manual reviews of résumés of new hires, the officials said.

“They now have to bring them back to FLETC,” said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.

The AI tool was initially the mechanism used to categorize résumés, the officials said. The officials weren’t sure how many officers were improperly trained. It’s also not clear how many may have been sent out to begin immigration arrests.

As the immigration agency surges agents into American cities, their enforcement tactics are increasingly questioned by local law enforcement, community groups and lawmakers following the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.

Ross had more than 10 years of experience with ICE and wouldn’t have been subject to the AI screening for new recruits.

The error highlights the challenge of training such a large number of new recruits as ICE continues to ramp up operations to boost deportation numbers amid pressure from the White House. ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency’s vetting process, NBC News has reported.

In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Minnesota has sued to try to remove DHS.

ICE had a mandate to hire 10,000 new officers by the end of 2025 and offered new recruits $50,000 signing bonuses using the money Congress allocated under the One Big Beautiful Bill. One of the officials said that although ICE met the goal on paper, bringing back people who were misidentified for more training means it didn’t successfully add 10,000 ICE officers on the street in 2025.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260114-ice-officer-badge-vl-146p-97e565.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 12:59:39.809048

The first point to make here is that plans to scrap the existing asylum appeal system were trailed in the summer then formally announced on 17 November 2025 with no prior consultation.
Since then, we have heard nothing about details, timescales, transitional arrangements or whether the new system will apply to immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals.
The letter confirms that immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals will be heard by this new body.
All of this could potentially be accomplished within the existing system.","The Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has disclosed some further details on the new immigration and asylum appeal body. The plans are contained in a letter to the chair of the Justice Committee. Some further hints at the process behind the scenes separately emerged in live questions to Sarah Sackman, Minister of State for Courts and Legal Services.

The first point to make here is that plans to scrap the existing asylum appeal system were trailed in the summer then formally announced on 17 November 2025 with no prior consultation. The judiciary were only informed 24 hours beforehand. Since then, we have heard nothing about details, timescales, transitional arrangements or whether the new system will apply to immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals. Even now, the “details” that are emerging are very much outline principles.

The second point to make is that not only is the policy process is being led by the Home Office but the Ministry of Justice seems to have very little to do with these plans at all. Have a watch of Sarah Sackman’s brief evidence on this:

Sackman does not appear to be substantively engaged with the project. She speaks of her department “supporting” the Home Office with the project and the MOJ’s role being limited to “managing the transition”. It does not sound as if the new body would even sit within the Ministry of Justice. Will we be returning to the days prior to 1987 when the Home Office appointed adjudicators? How is that “independent” from the Home Office?

Mahmood’s letter suggests that the main purpose of the change is to widen the recruitment pool for appeal decision-makers. She implies there are too few people who meet current minimum recruitment standards who are willing to do the existing job of immigration judge. Essentially any barrister or solicitor with five years of experience is potentially eligible. That’s well over 200,000 people. And a person with equivalent experience in law is also eligible. Rather than seeking to improve pay, conditions or make more use of the ‘equivalent experience’ criterion, the government has decided to reduce the minimum qualifications required. We still do not know what the new minimum will be.

There will still be a right of appeal from the new body to the Upper Tribunal on an error of law, apparently. Some had wondered whether this would be so. Given the minimum qualifications for adjudicators will be widened from actual practicing lawyers to, by definition, non legally qualified individuals, it seems likely there will be more appeals to the Upper Tribunal than at present. That’s not a great way of speeding things up.

The letter confirms that immigration appeals as well as asylum appeals will be heard by this new body. Given that the appeals legislation will need changing, this perhaps (I’m looking for silver linings here) raises the possibility of restoring the “not in accordance with the law, including immigration rules” ground of appeal in place of the “human rights only” grounds introduced in 2014. But I’m not holding my breath.

There is reference in the letter to legal advice being facilitated before a claim is heard by the new body. There’s no equivalent reference to legal representation being funded for appeals at the new body. That’s concerning.

There is some language around making appeals one stop shops, albeit without using those exact words (™Jack Straw 1998). Over the last 30 years we have repeatedly heard politicians claiming to want one appeal to rule them all. Their civil servants have then repeatedly introduced systems that require separate claims to be brought consecutively. Adding issues to an existing appeal is considered by the Home Office to be an ambush, basically.

What would all help with getting all relevant issues decided at a single appeal is making the process fair and quick. Around three months for an initial decision, say, and then three to six months for an appeal. Instead, we’re going to have a load of ill-considered institutional upheaval taking years.

There will be a fast track for claims from safe countries. This is not referred to as a detained fast track, but one imagines it might involve detention. Some other cases will be prioritised by the new “independent” body on public interest grounds. These grounds will presumably be decided by one of the parties to the appeal (the Home Office) but not the other. Late claims made prior to removal would appear to be one such category, according to Mahmood.

The letter does say that the system will preserve “safeguarding for vulnerable individuals, ensuring complex protection claims receive the time and scrutiny required”.

My main thought is that this seems like a colossal waste of time and energy. All of this could potentially be accomplished within the existing system. Improvements to initial decision-making and early access to legal advice would reduce the pressure on the tribunal system. Instead, the government is looking at very complex, costly and protracted procedural changes which may well end up having no impact on the existing tribunal backlog, because existing appeals continue in the existing system. It’s a classic Home Office response to a genuine problem. Instead of doing the admittedly hard work needed to resolve genuine problems, tear it all up to create more work — which is an opportunity cost for doing other more purposeful and impactful work — and still having to solve the same difficult problems anyway.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shabana_Mahmood_Official_Cabinet_Portrait_July_2024_cropped_2-450x600.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:59:39.356248

The suspect was reported to be stable and is now in custody, while the ICE agent is allegedly in the hospital.

This comes after an incident last week in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good, a U.S. citizen, was fatally shot by an ICE agent, who fired into the driver's windshield and open window from the side of the vehicle and subsequently exclaimed ""f---ing b----"" as the car crashed into another parked vehicle.

Democrats and local residents have condemned the shooting as a murder and called for the agent's prosecution, while the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have defended the incident by arguing that it was a justified shooting.

Protests continued on Wednesday after the latest shooting, with demonstrators using horns and whistles and officers deploying tear gas and pepper balls.

There were at least a hundred people at the scene, where officers were dispersing pepper spray, throwing pepper balls and using flash bangs as rioters tossed items at the agents. Demonstrators were also calling on ICE to leave the city and holding signs with phrases such as ""f--- ICE.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a crowd was committing ""unlawful acts,"" including throwing fireworks at officers, and urged people to ""leave immediately.""

""This is already a very tense situation, and we do not need this to escalate any further,"" he said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz urged peaceful demonstrations in response to the shooting.

""I know you’re angry. I’m angry. What Donald Trump wants is violence in the streets. But Minnesota will remain an island of decency, of justice, of community, and of peace. Don’t give him what he wants,"" Walz wrote on X.

Walz also made an address to Minnesotans where he again called on ICE to leave the state.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has repeatedly demanded that ICE leave, said the agency's presence is not establishing safety for community members.

""This is an impossible situation that our city is presently being put in,"" he said at a news conference, adding that the deployment of roughly 3,000 ICE agents in Minneapolis and statewide was ""creating chaos.""

“There are no exceptions to the absolute and universal prohibition of the arbitrary deprivation of life.” “International law does not allow States to kill on the basis of labels, perceptions of how someone appears, or allegations of wrongdoing,” Tidball-Binz said.
“Where there is no armed conflict and no basis in international law for the use of military force, States must rely on law enforcement measures consistent with international legal obligations, including human rights and maritime law requirements,” the expert said.
“States must ensure a legal and operational framework on the use of force consistent with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,”he said.
“States must never normalise a ‘shoot-to-kill’ approach which erodes the strict and absolute limits international law places on the use of lethal force.” The Special Rapporteur is available to engage with the Government of the United States about these concerns.","GENEVA – The excessive and unlawful use of lethal force by United States of America security forces both extraterritorially, including on the high seas and in Venezuela, and domestically, in law enforcement operations especially related to immigration enforcement, is gravely concerning, a UN expert said today.

“Public statements by State officials signalling a “shoot-to-kill” posture risk lowering the threshold for the use of lethal force,” said Morris Tidball-Binz, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. “There are no exceptions to the absolute and universal prohibition of the arbitrary deprivation of life.”

“International law does not allow States to kill on the basis of labels, perceptions of how someone appears, or allegations of wrongdoing,” Tidball-Binz said. “Whether at sea, abroad, or at home, the use of lethal force must be strictly limited by the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and precaution, and may be used only as a last resort to protect life.”

Alarmed by lethal strikes against small vessels in international waters by the United States in the context of a so-called “war on narco-terrorism”, which have unlawfully killed scores of people since September, Tidball-Binz said he was particularly troubled at indications that some of the vessels could have been intercepted but were destroyed, including with double-tap strikes killing survivors.

“Where there is no armed conflict and no basis in international law for the use of military force, States must rely on law enforcement measures consistent with international legal obligations, including human rights and maritime law requirements,” the expert said. “The deliberate use of lethal force against persons who do not pose an imminent threat to life is unlawful and violates fundamental United States obligations under international law, and its own domestic laws.”

Expressing deep concern about the scores of deaths caused by the large-scale United States military action in Venezuela in early January, Tidball-Binz recalled that UN experts have underscored that the unprovoked use of armed force on the sovereign territory of another State is a breach of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter. It may also constitute the international crime of aggression attributable to individual political and military leaders involved.

“Deaths resulting from such an act of aggression are arbitrary by definition,” the Special Rapporteur warned.

“Accountability for human rights violations cannot be pursued through unilateral military intervention in violation of the UN Charter,” he said. “Respect for the right to life is inseparable from respect for international law, including the prohibition on the use of force.”

He also expressed grave concern about the fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis on 7 January 2026 during an operation involving federal immigration enforcement officers, stressing that any death involving law enforcement must be subject to a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial and transparent investigation with those responsible held accountable. Tidball-Binz urged all relevant authorities to fully cooperate to ensure an effective inquiry.

“States must ensure a legal and operational framework on the use of force consistent with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,”he said.

“Where potentially unlawful deaths occur, investigations should comply with the Minnesota Protocol [LINK] and victims’ families must have access to truth, justice and reparation,” the expert said.

Tidball-Binz referred to his report to the General Assembly which addresses unlawful killings by law enforcement officials and sets out practical measures to prevent loss of life and overcome recurrent obstacles to accountability, including in high-risk operational contexts.

He called on the United States to urgently review relevant laws, policies, rules of engagement, operational directives and oversight mechanisms governing the use of lethal force domestically and extraterritorially; to clarify the legal bases and safeguards applicable to maritime and extraterritorial operations; and ensure credible, independent and transparent investigations into all allegations of unlawful killing.

“The right to life is non-derogable and non- negotiable,” he said. “States must never normalise a ‘shoot-to-kill’ approach which erodes the strict and absolute limits international law places on the use of lethal force.”

Ceisler emphasized that ending the partnership does not mean his office will obstruct federal enforcement.

""We are continuing to maintain an open dialogue with ICE and all our federal state and local law enforcement partners,"" he said. ""By any definition of a sanctuary county, we are not one.""

DHS said agents were attempting to arrest a man from Venezuela who was in the U.S. illegally when he crashed his vehicle into a parked car during a “targeted traffic stop.”

The officer caught up to the man, who DHS said began assaulting the officer. Amid a “struggle on the ground” between the pair, two other people came out from a nearby apartment and began attacking the officer, DHS said.

“As the officer was being ambushed and attacked by the two individuals, the original subject got loose and began striking the officer with a shovel or broomstick,” DHS said in a statement.

The officer then fired “defensive shots to defend his life,” hitting the victim in the leg. All three attackers fled into the apartment and barricaded themselves inside, according to DHS.

Witnesses told the Minnesota Star Tribune that officers broke down the apartment door to apprehend them.

All individuals involved were taken into custody, and both the officer and the man who was shot were hospitalized.

Minneapolis Mayor George Frey has continually urged protesters to remain calm amid “disgusting and intolerable” behavior from ICE.

“For those that have peacefully protested, I applaud you. For those that are taking the bait, you are not helping and you are not helping the undocumented immigrants in our city,” Frey said.

In a statement about Wednesday’s shooting, DHS admonished the response from local officials, including Frey and Minnesota Gov. Walz.

Latest ICE shooting comes week after Renee Good’s death

The incident comes a week after the fatal shooting of Renee Macklin Good, a 37-year-old mother who was protesting against ICE in Minneapolis.

On Wednesday, a Homeland Security official confirmed to NewsNation that the officer, Jonathan Ross, suffered internal bleeding after that incident.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said Ross was hit by Good’s vehicle Jan. 7, backing up the administration’s claims he shot the 37-year-old motorist in “self-defense.” “He went to the hospital. A doctor did treat him. He has been released, but he’s going to spend some time with his family,” Noem said last week.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2026/01/MINNESOTA-PROTEST-PT-2-011426-NYNEWOF1ENC007_mxf_00.04.20.29.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:24.070701

While migrants face obstacles in other Latin American countries, some have more structured and supportive integration efforts.
Colombia has implemented various initiatives to prevent statelessness among Venezuelan migrants, including granting protective status and allowing Venezuelan children to access citizenship in some cases.","In the borough of Arima, a small but bustling urban enclave with a country-town feel in north-central Trinidad, a cheerful two-story bungalow painted in turquoise and burgundy is emblazoned with a sign reading La Casita in cursive. Andreina Briceño Ventura-Brown founded it as a bilingual, community-based space for children in 2017. But in recent years, the rapid upswell of Venezuelans moving to the twin islands has shifted the community center’s focus to direct service for recent immigrants, especially women.

Since 2014, Venezuela has faced a deepening political and economic crisis that has forced about eight million people to flee the country. While Colombia hosts the largest number of Venezuelan migrants overall, Trinidad and Tobago, situated just off the coast, hosts the second-highest population of Venezuelan immigrants in the Caribbean. Historically, there has been a steady political, economic, and cultural exchange between the two nations. Venezuelans contributed to Trinidad’s cocoa industry and left a lasting cultural legacy, including the musical tradition of parang. And many Venezuelans travel to Trinidad to learn English. But recently, as conditions worsened in Venezuela, this movement shifted from short-term migration to one of survival. Since 2018, thousands have made the dangerous journey to Trinidad by boat, often arriving undocumented, vulnerable, and in search of safety.

The arrivals of Venezuelans to Trinidad has highlighted the fragility of the country’s immigration system, with many exposed to extreme xenophobia, exploitation, and marginalization due to their undocumented status.

While Trinidad is signatory to international treaties such as the 1951 and 1954 Refugee Conventions, as a dualist state, these agreements only take effect if domestic legislation is passed. In practice, this means there is no governing law requiring compliance, and the current Immigration Act of 1969 contains no provisions for refugees or asylum seekers. Attempts to address this gap have been limited. In 2014, the government, in partnership with the UNHCR, developed a policy to guide the treatment of migrants, but it is not legally binding and carries no enforcement power. A previous registration process allowed only a small number of migrants to formalize their status, leaving thousands in legal limbo. “Due to the deficiencies in our existing legislation and legal framework, that is one of the main reasons or the core reasons why there are so many challenges faced by the migrants,” explained Adaphia Trancoso-Ribeiro, former legal director of the Women’s Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), an organization that advocates for gender justice and human rights. Since the twin island lacks refugee legislation and a migration policy, many Venezuelans are left without legal avenues to reside or work. This increases their vulnerability and marginalization from Trindadian society.

While migrants face obstacles in other Latin American countries, some have more structured and supportive integration efforts. Colombia has implemented various initiatives to prevent statelessness among Venezuelan migrants, including granting protective status and allowing Venezuelan children to access citizenship in some cases. Historically, Ecuador also created opportunities for Venezuelans to regularize their status, with programs aimed at providing temporary residency to reduce vulnerability, though last year, President Daniel Noboa ended the agreement and an amnesty for Venezuelans in the country.",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/La-casita-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 07:59:39.069665

It started with a gunshot in Minneapolis. Days later, a massive leak followed — one that has now thrust thousands of US immigration agents out of the shadows and into a fierce national debate.

Personal and work-related details of roughly 4,500 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol employees have allegedly been shared online after being leaked by a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) whistleblower, according to multiple media reports.

The data reportedly includes names, work emails, phone numbers, job roles, and some résumé-style information, covering about 2,000 frontline agents, 150 supervisors, and thousands of support staff. Early reviews suggest that around 80% of those named are still employed by DHS, according to The Daily Beast.

The information was shared with ICE List, a website that describes itself as a journalistic accountability project documenting immigration enforcement activities.

Triggered by a deadly shooting

The alleged leak came shortly after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. Good was shot through the windshield of her car by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, an incident that sparked protests across the US and drew global attention.

Dominick Skinner, founder of ICE List, said the shooting pushed someone inside DHS to act. “It is a sign that people aren’t happy within the US government, clearly. The shooting was the last straw for many people,” Skinner told The Daily Beast.

Inside the ICE List project

The ICE List states that it does not publish home addresses or target family members. In an ethical statement on its website, the group argues that naming individuals is about accountability, not harassment.

The site claims it verifies identities using public tips, leaked documents, video analysis, and AI-assisted tools, with multiple confirmation steps before publishing any name. It also says individuals can request corrections or removal if they leave the agency.

Skinner told The Daily Beast that ICE List plans to publish “the majority” of the leaked names it can verify, while making exceptions for certain roles such as childcare workers and nurses within DHS.

DHS pushback and safety concerns

Federal officials have strongly condemned the alleged leak, warning it puts lives at risk.

In a statement to The Independent, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “The disgusting doxxing of our officers put their lives and their families in serious danger.” She added, “Our law enforcement officers are on the frontlines arresting terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and rapists.”

McLaughlin also warned that the release of such information could amount to “4,500 felonies,” citing rising threats and assaults against federal officers.

Lawmakers have previously tried to shut down similar efforts. Projects like ICEBlock have been taken offline in the past, and proposed legislation such as the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act aims to limit the public sharing of agent identities.

ICE List, however, is hosted in the Netherlands, where Skinner lives, placing it outside direct US jurisdiction.

The site states it will continue operating despite pressure, referring to its work as “documentation” rather than “intimidation.”",https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2026/01/Untitled-design-37.png,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:26.610324

Since ‍taking office a year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards and ‍screening immigrants’ social media posts and past speeches.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump’s immigration and travel-related ‍policies, saying ‍they harm due process guarantees and ​free speech. Trump and his ​allies ⁠say the policies seek to improve ‌domestic security.

ICE’s actions have been subject to particular criticism by protesters, community leaders, Democrats and human rights advocates.

On Monday, the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul sued the federal government. This is Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.

ATTORNEY GENERAL KEITH ELLISON: Deployment of thousands of armed, masked DHS agents to Minnesota has done our state serious harm.

Thank you so much for being with us. First off, can you talk about the lawsuit that’s being heard in court? The significance of what Saint Paul and Minneapolis — called the Twin Cities, for our global audience — is demanding right now, the ICE force dwarfing the number of police in the Twin Cities?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, I think what we’re seeing is that our constitutional observers and the firsthand accounts of our neighbors is working. We are providing evidence that shows just indiscriminate, unconstitutional violence coming from federal agents in the Twin Cities.

AMY GOODMAN: So, what exactly, Hwa Jeong Kim, is the Saint Paul City Council calling for now? We just heard that last clip of protests, when people are saying, “Take off your masks.” I mean, the issue of everything from the Minneapolis mayor saying, “Get the f— out of Minneapolis,” to ICE, to talking about what they’re allowed to do in the city. And what is your sense of the level of cooperation, or not, of the local police department, Minneapolis and Saint Paul being sanctuary cities?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, I mean, we have a separation ordinance that’s been in place for many years, and the Saint Paul City Council is looking at strengthening that language, just like the Minneapolis Council passed in their city recently. We, unfortunately, had an incident on Rose Street, where residents and myself witnessed what we believe to be cooperation, where our Saint Paul police officers helped secure a scene and helped escort ICE agents out. So, there is always opportunities to strengthen our laws and use every lever that we can to continue to protect our residents.

And I think the lawsuit is very, very clear: We don’t want ICE in our neighborhoods. They are violent, they are creating chaos and terrorizing our immigrant neighbors, and they are not keeping anyone safe. And, in fact, they are bringing danger on our streets every single day.

AMY GOODMAN: Earlier this week, you wrote on Facebook, quote, “To my North Enders, we are seeing a continuous presence of federal agents in our neighborhood. We have had additional community observers present throughout our neighborhood. And vulnerable folks should be very careful. Our neighborhood eyes and protection is working. It is working. We had several of our neighbors kidnapped today. Take precautions.” Can you elaborate on why you’re using the word “kidnap” and what precautions people can take?

HWA JEONG KIM: They’re racially profiling neighbors and just taking them off the streets. We have accounts of folks walking down the sidewalk getting scooped up, neighbors getting pulled out of vehicles. And so, it is not about whether or not they have a warrant. That has never been the case. It’s always been about violent racial profiling in our streets.

And so, right now we’re encouraging our neighbors to be really careful. I myself am carrying around two forms of ID. I’m a naturalized citizen. Neighbors are also considering not going to work, not sending their kids to school, not going grocery shopping, not going to the laundromat — the very simple things that just keep families going. Lack of child care is incredibly important right now for families. So, we’re really hoping to tap into those mutual aid networks to support families in this time. And it’s difficult, as someone that’s watching and hearing and is very tapped into rapid response, to hear the number of people that are taken every hour here in the Twin Cities, in good conscience to tell folks that it feels safe to walk out on your street today.

AMY GOODMAN: In addition to the massive influx of ICE agents, you have now President Trump said they’re revoking TPS status for Somalis — you have a large Somali community in the Twin Cities — and that they will also denaturalize Somali citizens. And they’re going to do mass deportation? What do you understand is going on here? They would have to leave by February, he said.

HWA JEONG KIM: So many of our Somali neighbors are citizens. And so, I think this is incredibly — this is an incredibly dangerous tactic, as we see them attempt to strip away TPS statuses for many communities. And many folks know, here in the Twin Cities, Somali folks are incredibly important to the fabric of our neighborhoods, and not just because of the value that they bring, but because they are humans and that deserve dignity and protection. And the vast majority of our Somali neighbors are citizens.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you tell us about the Saint Paul mayor recently saying, “I wasn’t born here. I’m carrying my passport card and my ID with me all the time, because I don’t know when I’m going to be detained”? Her family fled Laos for the United States when she was 3. Your response?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, Mayor Kaohly Her is a close friend of mine. I myself, my partner is trans. We’ve been carrying around two forms of ID for many, many months. And it was a conversation that I personally had with her, as well. Folks that look like us and look like our communities that we serve and our neighbors are very afraid right now. And even if you are a citizen and you are not white, it is an incredibly fearful event leaving the house every single day and stepping onto the streets of our city. And yeah, we see a lot of our neighbors stepping up to make sure that we’re protected, that we have eyes on each other, and that we’re supporting each other to the best of our abilities in this really difficult time.

AMY GOODMAN: Faith and labor leaders and groups in Minneapolis are calling for a general strike January 23rd. Are you supporting this?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. So much great organizing is coming from our labor unions, and even with SPFE. Our Teachers Union stood up an incredible program to help protect our students. So, yes, I’m incredibly supportive. I’m signed on, and I plan on participating.

AMY GOODMAN: Final comment on the loss of the six experienced attorneys in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minneapolis who have all just quit, followed by five attorneys in the Civil Rights Division in Washington, D.C., because President Trump’s former personal lawyer Todd Blanche has said they won’t be doing a civil rights investigation into the death of Renee Good? If you can talk about the loss of this experience and these attorneys who would be involved with an investigation into Renee’s death?

HWA JEONG KIM: Yeah, I think a lot of folks are putting everything on the line to do what’s right. I think what’s resonating with me in this moment is seeing those resignations, knowing that there’s a line in the sand that folks are unwilling to cross, because the bottom line that a lot of us feels, that there’s there’s no one coming to save us. And that feels really scary, but also empowering, because if it’s up to us, and we draw the line in the sand, and we have the ability to follow through and be accountable to our constituents, to protect them and ensure that immigrant communities and families are safe, we should absolutely do everything within our power and everything within our privilege to do that. And so, seeing them stepping down, I think, is an incredible sign of where the value set and the moral line is for folks right now that are attempting to keep our community safe.

AMY GOODMAN: Hwa Jeong Kim, I want to thank —

HWA JEONG KIM: And that we’re not going to —

AMY GOODMAN: Go ahead.

HWA JEONG KIM: We’re not going to just step down — we’re not just going to turn a blind eye, but we’re doing everything in our power.

AMY GOODMAN: Hwa Jeong Kim, vice president of the Saint Paul City Council, also a member of Immigrant Defense Network.

When we come back, what happens when ICE hires agents with minimal or no screening, then sends them into the streets armed and masked? We’ll speak to a journalist who applied for an ICE job and was offered it without even a background check. And we’ll look at the rapid expansion of ICE detention in Trump’s first year in office. Stay with us.

Half of Americans view ICE unfavorably More generally, about half (52%) of Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of ICE.
While there is not majority support for eliminating ICE, support for this position has increased since Donald Trump's first term as president.
In contrast, majorities of Republicans support keeping ICE in its current form and expanding its size and funding.
In addition to supporting several other restrictions to ICE, majorities of Americans support rules that would make ICE agents more identifiable.","On January 7 in Minneapolis, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good. The shooting sparked an escalation in protests against ICE, an agency that has drawn increasing criticism since the Trump administration significantly increased its funding and hiring and deployed agents to cities across the U.S.

YouGov polling in October 2025 found that majorities of Americans disapproved of ICE and had concerns about the agency's treatment of both citizens and immigrants. New YouGov polling shows that majorities of Americans say that Ross' shooting of Good was not justified and that it should lead to criminal charges. More broadly, Americans view ICE far less favorably than several other federal agencies. Nearly half of Americans now say that ICE should be eliminated as a federal agency entirely, a significant increase from past polling. Majorities of Americans support major changes that would place new restrictions on ICE. (The findings on this poll are largely consistent with other recent YouGov polling about ICE and the shooting conducted in partnership with the Economist and Yahoo News.)

Majorities of Americans say the ICE agent was not justified in the Minneapolis shooting and should face criminal charges

Two-thirds (67%) of Americans say they have heard a lot about Ross shooting and killing Good (the question didn't name either person). Only 11% say they have not heard about the shooting. Democrats are more likely than Independents and Republicans to say they have heard a lot about the shooting (80% vs. 61%).

Additionally, most Americans (70%) say they have seen video footage of the shooting. Only one-quarter (26%) say they have not seen any video footage.

A majority (53%) of Americans say that Ross was not justified in shooting Good. Only 28% say the shooting was justified. While majorities of Democrats (88%) and Independents (58%) believe the shooting was not justified, only 15% of Republicans agree. A majority (61%) of Republicans say that Ross was justified in shooting Good.

A majority (53%) of Americans say that Ross should face criminal charges for shooting Good. Only 30% say he should not face charges. Majorities of Democrats (90%) and Independents (54%) say Ross should face charges, but only 14% of Republicans agree. A majority (63%) of Republicans say he should not.

Most Americans think ICE often uses unnecessary force against people, regardless of immigration status or violations of immigration law

Taking a broader view, most Democrats and Independents think that ICE uses unnecessary physical force against U.S. citizens, authorized immigrants, and unauthorized immigrants. About 90% of Democrats, 60% of Independents, and 30% of Republicans say ICE sometimes or often uses unnecessary force against each group.

In our October poll, Americans were more likely to say that ICE uses unnecessary force against unauthorized immigrants than to say the agency uses unnecessary force against U.S. citizens or immigrants who have not committed any violations. That distinction still exists among Republicans: 35% say ICE uses unnecessary force against unauthorized immigrants, compared to 28% who say they use unnecessary force against U.S. citizens. But Democrats and Independents are now slightly more likely to say ICE uses unnecessary force against U.S. citizens than to say it does so against unauthorized immigrants.

A majority (53%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful, compared to just 12% who say they are not forceful enough. And nearly half (46%) of Americans say they are somewhat or very concerned that ICE could mistreat someone they know, equal to the share who say they are not very or not at all concerned about this (46%). More Americans approve than disapprove of recent protests against ICE (49% vs. 42%). These figures are all similar to those expressed by Americans in the October poll of attitudes about ICE.

Half of Americans view ICE unfavorably

More generally, about half (52%) of Americans have a somewhat or very unfavorable opinion of ICE. Only 40% view the agency favorably. For comparison, we also asked Americans about their views of eight other federal agencies. ICE is the only agency included in our poll that is viewed unfavorably by more Americans than the share who view it favorably. It is also the agency viewed favorably by the smallest share of Americans, and unfavorably by the largest. The next least popular agencies in the survey — the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — are viewed unfavorably by only 39% of Americans each.

While ICE is unpopular overall, views are highly polarized by party. The agency is overwhelmingly viewed negatively by Democrats: ICE has a net favorability rating of −68 among Democrats, meaning the share of Democrats with unfavorable opinions of ICE is 68 percentage points larger than the share who have favorable opinions. No other agency in our poll comes close to such a negative outlook among Democrats. The next lowest net favorability among Democrats is for the FBI: −4. In contrast, Republicans overwhelmingly view ICE favorably, giving the agency a net favorability of +57. This means ICE is viewed more favorably by Republicans than all but one other agency in our survey: the National Weather Service (+60). The NWS is also the most popular agency in the survey among Democrats (+66) and Americans overall (+64).

Nearly half of Americans would eliminate ICE as a federal agency

Americans are divided over whether ICE should be abolished entirely: 42% somewhat or strongly support eliminating the agency, while 45% oppose doing so. While there is not majority support for eliminating ICE, support for this position has increased since Donald Trump's first term as president. In 2018, 29% of Americans supported abolishing ICE, and in 2019, 33% supported it — according to polls that, unlike the latest one, specified that if ICE were abolished, it would be replaced with a different agency.

Younger adults are particularly likely to support eliminating ICE. A majority (58%) of adults under 30 would eliminate the agency, as would nearly half of Americans between 30 and 44 (46%, compared to 35% who oppose eliminating it) — both higher than in 2019. There has also been an increase in support among older Americans, though a majority of Americans 45 and older still oppose eliminating ICE.

Majorities of Americans say ICE needs big change and restrictions

A majority (56%) of Americans say that deaths caused by ICE agents or in ICE custody show that there is a fundamental problem with ICE that needs to be fixed. Only 28% of Americans say that these deaths are unavoidable and do not show that there is a fundamental problem with ICE. Majorities of Democrats (90%) and Independents (59%) say that these deaths reflect a problem in ICE that needs to be fixed. Only 19% of Republicans agree; a majority (61%) do not see these deaths as indicative of a fundamental problem.

Americans are more likely to support than to oppose several changes to ICE that would place more restrictions on the agency. Two-thirds (68%) of Americans strongly or somewhat support creating stricter recruitment requirements for ICE agents. A majority (58%) support criminally prosecuting any ICE agent who kills someone. And more Americans support than oppose reducing ICE's size and funding (49% vs. 38%).

In contrast, more Americans oppose than support keeping ICE in its current form (49% vs. 37%). Expanding ICE and loosening restrictions on its recruitment are even less popular. Half of Americans oppose expanding ICE's size and funding (50% vs. 36% who support it). A majority (63%) oppose loosening recruitment requirements so that ICE can hire new agents more quickly.

While there is majority support for proposals that would restrict ICE and widespread opposition to expanding the agency, these potential changes are viewed very differently by Democrats and Republicans. While Democrats overwhelmingly support creating stricter recruitment requirements for ICE, criminally prosecuting ICE agents who kill people, and reducing the agency's size and funding, far fewer Republicans support these changes. In contrast, majorities of Republicans support keeping ICE in its current form and expanding its size and funding. One source of some agreement: Less than half of both Democrats and Republicans support loosening recruitment requirements so that ICE can hire new agents more quickly, though this proposal is still opposed by far more Democrats than Republicans.

In addition to supporting several other restrictions to ICE, majorities of Americans support rules that would make ICE agents more identifiable. Over two-third (69%) of Americans say agents should be required to wear uniforms when making arrests, compared to just 17% who say uniforms should not be required. And a majority (55%) say that ICE agents should not be allowed to wear masks that hide their identities when making arrests, compared to 31% who say such masks should be allowed.

Majorities of Democrats and Independents support requiring uniforms and banning face masks for ICE agents. Republicans are also more likely to support than to oppose uniform requirements (44% vs. 37%), but a majority of Republicans (63%) would allow ICE agents to wear masks that hide their identities. Only 23% wouldn't allow it.

A majority of Americans also believe that ICE should comply with instructions from states' governors, not just from federal leaders. About half (48%) of Americans say that if a state's governor calls on ICE to leave an area, agents should be required to leave. A further 11% say that agents should voluntarily leave, though they should not be required to do so. Only about one-quarter (27%) of Americans say ICE should not leave an area after a governor calls on them to do so.

A majority of Americans say ICE should stay away from schools

After an ICE agent shot Good, and other agents were seen outside a high school, Minneapolis Public Schools and neighboring districts closed schools to ensure students would be safe from ICE activities. A majority (58%) of Americans say this closure was a reasonable precaution, while only 31% say it was an unreasonable reaction. While majorities of Democrats (83%) and Independents (60%) say the closure was reasonable, only 30% of Republicans do. A majority of Republicans (61%) say it was unreasonable.

More broadly, most Americans (64%) say that ICE agents should not be allowed on K-12 school campuses. Only 20% say they should be allowed. While most Democrats (87%) and Independents (68%) say ICE agents should not be allowed on school campuses, Republicans are about evenly split: 39% of Republicans say agents should be allowed on campuses, while 36% say they should not.

Methodology: This YouGov poll was conducted online on January 9 - 11, 2026, among 1,129 U.S. adult citizens. Respondents were selected from YouGov’s opt-in panel to be representative of adult U.S. citizens. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education, region, 2024 presidential vote, 2020 election turnout and presidential vote, baseline party identification, and current voter registration status. Demographic weighting targets come from the 2019 American Community Survey. 2024 presidential vote, at time of weighting, was estimated to be 48% Harris and 50% Trump. Baseline party identification is the respondent’s most recent answer given around November 8, 2024, and is weighted to the estimated distribution at that time (31% Democratic, 32% Republican). The margin of error for the overall sample is approximately 4 points.

A screenshot of Huseynov’s Facebook page.

The Trump administration maintains its mass deportation program is aimed only at “the worst of the worst.”

In reality, the crackdown on immigrants is a dragnet, one that’s now ensnared a well-regarded neuroscience researcher from the University at Buffalo.

Azerbaijan native Shovgi Huseynov has no criminal record and a visa that allows him to work in the United States through 2029. But on January 7, Huseynov made a wrong turn onto the Peace Bridge and was detained by border agents upon his return to Buffalo.

A spokesperson for U.S Customs and Border Protection said agents “determined he may be subject to removal from the U.S.” and turned him over to ICE. He gave no specific reason for his arrest.

Huseynov has been held at the Batavia detention center for the past week.

According to UB spokesperson John Della Contrada, Huseynov had been working as a researcher at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences since 2022 on a work authorization approved by the Department of Homeland Security. Huseynov entered the country on a J1 visa commonly extended to university students and researchers, a spokesperson from ICE said, who indicated Huseynov had an application for another visa or other legal status pending.

The ICE spokesperson, in a statement, alleged Huseynov didn’t have legal status and said the agency is now seeking to deport him.

Huseynov is not alone. In the past year, at least five other people have been detained by immigration authorities after making a wrong turn onto one of the bridges in the Buffalo area to Canada. That figure, however, only counts people who were criminally charged upon reentry because they’d been previously deported. More people, like Huseynov, have been detained after a wrong turn but not criminally charged.

Such consistent ICE detentions following a wrong turn are a new phenomenon, said Jennifer Connor, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Justice for Migrant Families. Under past administrations, she said, such mistakes would often just delay a traveler. Sometimes they would result in a brief detention and an order to appear before an immigration judge.

“After January 2025, [detention] became the rule,” she said. “It seemed like everyone got detained.”

A respected researcher

For four years, Huseynov has been conducting complicated neuroscience research at the Jacobs School, focusing on various biological phenomena in the brains of opioid-addicted mice in an attempt to understand how the brain and immune system work together. He’s published several research papers alongside colleagues.

In recent Facebook posts, he’s noted his son’s success at swim meets, announced he had attended a large neuroscience conference in San Diego and celebrated his cultural heritage.

“We have been living in the United States of America for 5 years now, but as true Azerbaijanis, we keep our national and moral values, traditions alive [and] we teach our children,” he wrote in a March post. “We are proud to be Azerbaijani and represent it here.”

In other posts, he wrote about how dedicated he was to his job at UB. In a post from December 2024, Huseynov apologized for falling out of touch with friends due to focusing on his research and his family.

“I came to America with 1 purpose, 1 deed, and from the first day of my arrival, no reason has been able to divert me from my path and lead me in other directions,” he wrote. “I spend at least 12-14 hours in a day doing science. Real science is such a thing that you always have to think, do research, get acquainted with the latest innovations and publications in your field of research.”

One colleague at UB, research professor Michael Morales, spoke highly of Huseynov.

“He’s a good scientist, a good citizen. I consider him very hard working,” Morales said. “He was fun to work with.”

Morales noted that Huseynov has a wife and two young children, one of whom is a U.S. citizen.

“He’s certainly not a troublemaker or anything like that,” he said. “He’s found the same pathway that lots of international scientists have.”

Investigative Post attempted to reach Huseynov for this story but was not successful. Phone and text messages left for him at the ICE detention center were not returned. An attorney working with Huseynov, Siana McLean, declined to comment.

In a statement, Della Contrada said UB is aware of Huseynov’s arrest and is monitoring the situation.

“As more information becomes available, UB will provide appropriate support to his family and to his personal attorney,” he said.

Wrong turns lead to detention

In both Buffalo and Lewiston, it can be easy to drive into the wrong lane and get stuck heading to Canada with no way to turn around.

In at least five cases over the past year, migrant drivers have gotten stuck in the wrong lane, crossed into Canada and were detained by U.S. border agents upon their return.

The case of Giovanni Bernal Guerrero is typical.

On the evening of July 19, he was the passenger in a car that made a wrong turn onto the Peace Bridge. The driver traveled across to Canada, turned around and attempted to re-enter the United States. Upon inspection, Bernal Guerrero was found to have been previously deported to Mexico and agents arrested him.

He’s since been deported a second time.

Then there’s the case of Oscar Hernandez Sanchez.

Driving a tractor trailer last June, Hernandez Sanchez realized he’d taken the wrong lane of exit 9 and pulled over near the Duty Free store on the U.S. side of the Peace Bridge. He then attempted to back his truck down the ramp so he could re-enter Interstate 190. That’s when two Customs and Border Protection agents stopped him “out of concern that a traffic accident would occur,” according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court.

The agents asked Hernandez Sanchez for documentation, which included a Mexican passport and an ID from the Mexican consulate. They found he had been previously deported in 2011 and arrested him. He was ordered deported in September.

Arrests and detentions at bridges common

It’s not just a Western New York phenomenon. In Detroit, NPR reported that more than 200 people were detained at the Ambassador Bridge between January and April of last year, most the result of a wrong turn into Canada.

In other local cases, entire families have been detained at the bridges after being turned back from Canada. Last March, for example, a family attempting to emigrate to Canada was denied entry and subsequently held at the Rainbow Bridge for two weeks.

Connor, of Justice for Migrant Families, said detentions at the bridges worry her — whether for wrong turns or another reason — because there’s no public information about those held there. When a person is held at an ICE detention center, their names can be found in an online database. Not so for those detained in a cell at a bridge. That makes getting someone out all the more difficult.

“The issue that still exists with the detentions at the bridges is the complete lack of transparency,” Connor said.

One of her solutions? Don’t take Interstate 190. Find an alternative route.

“I give people advice about this constantly, because I’m trying to do damage control on it,” she said. “It’s like this very easy mistake with devastating consequences.”",https://www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screen-Shot-2026-01-13-at-6.54.39-PM.png,N,,2026-01-15 05:58:08.543377

Agents taking part in President Donald Trump's immigration sweeps have been repeatedly accused of targeting anyone with black or brown skin without proof they are undocumented, and now some Native American tribes are advising members on their rights if they encounter ICE.

This week, ICT, a nonprofit news group that shares stories from Indigenous communities, reported that at least five Native Americans were detained during ICE operations in Minneapolis, Minnesota, despite being U.S. citizens.

Tensions in Minneapolis, and nationwide, grew this week in the wake of the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by ICE agents in the city. Protests took place across the country on Sunday, Jan. 11, against ICE.

In the wake of the Minneapolis shooting and detentions, Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle cautioned members in a Facebook post that ICE may operate in the Upper Peninsula, and reminded tribal members they hold U.S. citizenship.

""In recent weeks, heightened tensions have emerged as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have stopped and detained tribal members and tribal descendants, raising urgent concerns about dignity, safety, and respect for Native American citizens,"" Gravelle wrote. ""Tribal citizens, including all Bay Mills Indian Community tribal citizens, are United States citizens by law — by virtue of the Snyder Act, also known as the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. ICE has no jurisdiction over U.S. citizens in matters of immigration.""

Gravelle added that ""These encounters cut against the sacrifices of our ancestors, who fought to protect our people, our lands, and our inherent rights, and they violate our shared values of respect for human life and the responsibility we share to protect one another.""

In a separate press release, Sault Tribe Chairman Austin Lowes also spoke out against ""recent aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities.""

“The Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians strongly condemns recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities that have created fear, confusion, and anxiety within Indigenous communities and among minority communities more broadly. Enforcement actions that rely on intimidation and racial profiling undermine public trust and place innocent people at risk,"" Lowes said in the release.

“Let me be clear: the Sault Tribe opposes any ICE activity that creates fear and anxiety in both tribal communities and larger communities as a whole. No one should feel unsafe in their neighborhood, workplace, or homeland because of how they look, the language they speak, or the country they were born in,"" Lowes said in the release. “Recent incidents involving the unlawful detention of tribal citizens from federally recognized tribal nations are deeply troubling and unacceptable. Tribal citizens are members of sovereign governments. These actions disregard tribal sovereignty and the government-to-government relationship between tribal nations and the United States.""

Here's what to know.

What is the Snyder Act?

The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, also known as the Snyder Act, was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on June 2, 1924, granting full citizenship to American Indians and Alaska Native Americans, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior - Indian Affairs.

The 15th Amendment, passed in 1870, granted all U.S. citizens the right to vote regardless of race, but it wasn't until the 1924 that American Indians and Alaska Native Americans could enjoy the rights granted by the amendment, the Department of the Interior said.

""That all non-citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided that the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property,"" the Act says.

Why would ICE agents be in Michigan's UP?

Gravelle said ICE agents may be more likely to be in the Sault Ste. Marie and Bay Mills areas because of the international border with Canada at the Soo Locks.

""Bay Mills Indian Community is located in a border region near the international boundary between the United States and Canada, and because of this proximity, federal law enforcement activity may be more visible in and around our homelands, and community members may encounter ICE or other federal agents more frequently,"" she wrote.

Do Native American tribes offer proof of citizenship?

Gravelle reminded members that their tribal ID cards provide proof of citizenship.

""While Tribal Identification Cards are valid and should be sufficient to establish U.S. citizenship and immigration status, it is not guaranteed that every ICE agent will recognize or understand this reality, creating unnecessary risk and harm,"" Gravelle wrote.

“First, tribal citizens concerned about potential encounters with ICE are encouraged to carry their tribal identification card or a copy of their degree of Indian blood, along with a state-issued ID at all times,"" Lowes said. ""Tribal identification affirms tribal citizenship and political status and establishes your identity as a member of a federally recognized tribal nation and as a United States citizen.""

What do officials recommend tribal members do?

In a two-page FAQ, the Bay Mills Community said all tribal citizens should ensure they have a valid and current tribal ID and enrollment card. The FAQ also advised members to be prepared to show additional documentation if asked, including such things as passport, passport card, Real ID license or immigration status paperwork.

Lowes also said tribal members may remain silent.

“If you are harassed, stopped or detained by ICE, remain calm,"" Lowes said. ""You have the right to remain silent and the right to ask to speak with an attorney. Do not sign anything ICE gives you. As a tribal citizen, you cannot be deported. ICE cannot enter your home without a warrant signed by a judge, and you are within your rights to ask them to identify themselves as ICE agents with proper documentation.

“Third, if you are detained, or if a family member is detained, I strongly encourage you to state, ‘I am a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, a federally recognized tribal nation. Under the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, all Native American people born within the territorial limits of the United States are recognized as U.S. citizens by birthright. I am both a tribal citizen and a U.S. citizen. Therefore, ICE has no lawful authority to detain me,’"" Lowes' release said.

How should tribal members deal with ICE in public spaces?

The Bay Mills FAQ said tribal members should ask ICE agents if they are free to leave and do so if possible. It also said they have the right to record agents.

If someone is detained, they have the right to remain silent and request an attorney. The FAQ recommended showing ID to the agents, but reiterated members do not have to speak.

If ICE arrives at a private home, the sheet suggested speaking through a closed door, peephole or window. Residents should request a signed judicial warrant before allowing entry.

The FAQ noted most ICE warrants are administrative (signed by an ICE official) rather than judicial (signed by a judge) and do not allow entry into a home without permission.

""If there is not a valid judicial warrant, you do not need to open your door or consent to any searches,"" the FAQ says.

However, if ICE agents enter a home without consent, the tribe recommends avoiding physical resistance, but to clearly state that a person does not consent.

How should members deal with ICE at tribal buildings?

The Bay Mills Community FAQ notes ICE only may access public spaces, including the lobby of the governmental center and waiting room of the health center without a judicial warrant.

Employees are instructed to ask for a judicial warrant if they encounter ICE, and the FAQ notes only the president can grant access to private areas.

If no warrant is provided, employees should ask ICE to leave. If agents refuse or start a search, employees should state that they do not consent to a search and while contacting tribal officials.","https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/19/PMJS/83729181007-mjs-enbridge-18-3.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 05:58:13.234863

Abbott posted the allegations to his X account on Wednesday morning, stating, ""A criminal illegal alien rammed ICE vehicles in San Antonio, sending an agent to the hospital.""
""What I'll say is the men and women of ICE, the men of women of VRO, the men women of HSI, they're not committing any crimes.
This incident comes a week after Renae Good was killed by ICE agents in Minneapolis, sparking protests across the country.","SAN ANTONIO - A new video captured by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows the moments someone rammed ICE agents with a car here in San Antonio.

The vehicle was driven by a migrant in San Antonio, sending an agent to the hospital, according to an X post from Governor Greg Abbott.

Abbott posted the allegations to his X account on Wednesday morning, stating, ""A criminal illegal alien rammed ICE vehicles in San Antonio, sending an agent to the hospital.""

He calls for the arrest of those obstructing immigration enforcement, claiming organized groups are putting officers and law-abiding civilians at risk.

The incident happened on Tuesday on the North Side at the Walmart Supercenter along Blanco Road near Wurzbach Parkway.

The video, shot by ICE, was first broadcast Tuesday night on ""Hannity."" It shows ICE agents surrounding the vehicle while speaking with the driver, whose windows are up.

According to the ""Hannity Report,” the driver was allegedly in the country illegally.

The driver begins to move the vehicle, despite agents’ attempts to stop him. They then try to flee, reversing and slamming into a vehicle behind him, and then forward again, crashing into a second car as ICE agents attempted to intervene.

Agents are seen drawing their weapons as the situation escalates. The driver eventually exits the vehicle and lies on the ground, where he is taken into custody.

We have been able to confirm with federal sources that the agent on the driver's side of the vehicle is Miguel Vergara, Field Office Director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

But many questions remain. We reached out to San Antonio police, but no police report on the incident exists. We also reached out to the Bexar County Sheriff's Office to see if they were called, and we've also called ICE for comment. We haven't received any additional information about the agent who was injured or what hospital they were taken to.

In an interview with Fox News, ICE director Todd Lyons said agents face roadblocks like this every day. He says while people have the constitutional right to protest, it's unlawful to impede or obstruct law enforcement operations.

""It's constant impediments, constant attacks like this, and, you know, it's not safe for my folks. It's not safe for the public. It really needs to stop.""

Lyons said the agent who was inside the vehicle that was rammed had to be hospitalized for neck injuries. He says HSI, ICE, and the FBI are investigating incidents like these and intend to hold people accountable.

When asked about the Philadelphia District Attorney's threat to prosecute ICE agents, Lyons said they don't have to worry about arresting his agents.

""What I'll say is the men and women of ICE, the men of women of VRO, the men women of HSI, they're not committing any crimes. So he doesn't have to worry about arresting any of my folks, because what we're doing is we're enforcing the law. We are out there every day making this nation and his city safe again. So he shouldn't worry about the men or women of ICE.""

Each group had roughly a dozen people in attendance, with many signing up to speak during public comment. Some speakers even led chants with their groups when they had a chance to talk.

“ICE out now! ICE out now!” one chant exclaimed during Tuesday’s city council meeting.

“Trump’s ICE agents are terrorizing our cities,” Sawant said at the council meeting. “Thousands of immigrant, working, and poor people are being grabbed off the street.”

SAARPR launched an “anti-ICE petition” for members of the Seattle City Council to sign, demanding accountability for ICE’s actions while additionally calling for an immediate end to ICE raids and mass deportations in the region.

The council engaged in a back-and-forth discussion with the public after the public comment period closed, but the interruptions got out of hand, prompting the council to briefly suspend its meeting.

“Will you let us continue our business?” Hollingsworth asked. “OK, we’re going to go into a 10-minute recess to cool it out.”

The Seattle City Council was able to take up business after a recess. Newly elected City Council President Joy Hollingsworth agreed to meet with SAARPR after the council meeting, but it ended abruptly when Hollingsworth would not commit to signing the petition at that time.

“Councilmember Joy Hollingsworth claimed that she would meet with us face to face, and we had a short meeting where she and the rest of the council admitted she had not read our letter, and would not be signing onto it,” SAARPR stated on social media after the meeting. “Knowing this, we have declined the meeting on Wednesday. We will not waste our time. We will continue to disrupt and demand action from the city council.

Platitudes are no longer acceptable,” the statement continued. “Now is the time for action.”

Kshama Sawant is running for Congress against incumbent Adam Smith.

Bucks County Sheriff Danny Ceisler made the announcement during a press conference on Wednesday, Jan. 14, outside the Bucks County Justice Center on North Main Street in Doylestown.

“After careful evaluation, I have determined that the certain public safety costs of this ICE partnership are greatly outweighed by any potential public safety benefits that this partnership may offer,” Ceisler said. “That is why this morning I signed an order terminating the 287(g) partnership between the Bucks County Sheriff’s Office and ICE.”

In April 2025, Fred Harran -- who was the Bucks County Sheriff at the time – announced a plan for his office to partner with ICE under the 287(g) agreement, allowing local law enforcement agencies to become deputized to perform immigration enforcement.

“The 287(g) program dates back to the Clinton administration but has been far more widely used during the Trump administration, particularly during the second Trump administration, as a method to assist in the administration’s stated goals of deporting over one million men, women and children per year,” Ceisler said.

Ceisler explained that 287(g) partnerships can take the forms of jail enforcement, warrant service or a task force, with the task force model granting “exceptionally broad authority” to local law enforcement agencies.

“It allows officers to stop, interrogate and detain anybody who they believe is in the country without current authorization,” Ceisler said.

Harran described the task force as a “common-sense initiative” that allowed select deputies in his office to utilize a federal immigration database and identify individuals who were in the country illegally and were taken into custody based on existing criminal charges and outstanding warrants in Bucks County.

Harran defended his efforts to work with ICE during an appearance on NBC10 @Issue and Battleground Politics with Lauren Mayk. Harran insisted the task force would only go after those who were charged with crimes in the Bucks County region.

“What is so bad about making the arrests, which we do now, but now, afterwards, ship them out so they can’t commit crimes tomorrow? Because our courts, our judicial system, our prisons are packed,” Harran said. “They cannot hold the amount of people. So why not save the U.S. taxpayer dollar and ship them back to the country they came from? Only those people that have already been charged with a crime. I’m not talking about somebody owning a pizza shop or working a landscape company. That’s not who we’re talking about here.”

Harran’s initial announcement of the plan led to considerable backlash, including a lawsuit from the ACLU of Pennsylvania, Make the Road Pennsylvania, NAACP Bucks County, and the BuxMont Unitarian Universalists. The lawsuit – which was filed in September 2025 – accused the sheriff of making the move illegally and claimed that the decision should have been made by the Bucks County Commissioners.

Bucks County Judge Hon. Jeffrey Trauger sided with Harran in an October 2025 ruling, however.

“Today’s court ruling is a victory for the law-abiding residents of Bucks County and a validation of a common-sense approach to public safety which fully leverages partnerships and resources to keep our communities safe,” Harran said at the time. “This decision affirms our ability to use this simple tool to ensure individuals who commit crimes in our county are held fully accountable – regardless of their immigration status.”

A month after the ruling however, Harran – a Republican – was ousted by his Democratic challenger Danny Ceisler in the Bucks County sheriff’s race. Ceisler won by a margin of about 15% as part of a “blue wave” in a county that was long considered “purple” as far as politics.

After his victory, Ceisler, a U.S. Army veteran, attorney and former public safety official in the Shapiro administration, assumed office on Jan. 5, 2026.

During Wednesday’s announcement, Ceisler said 16 deputies in Bucks County had received expanded immigration authority under Harran though no immigrants had actually been detained. While explaining his decision to end the partnership, Ceisler talked about Bucks County’s community of over 50,000 immigrants, primarily from India, South Asia, Latin America, Liberia and Ukraine.

“Those immigrants are our neighbors. They are our friends. They are taxpayers,” Ceisler said. “And they deserve the protection of law enforcement in this community.”

Ceisler said he received feedback from immigration leaders in the community who told him immigrants were living in fear under the county’s ICE partnership.

“One leader in the Latino community who wasn’t able to make it today reported to me that not a single member of their community had called 911 or felt comfortable reporting a crime since this partnership became public,” Ceisler said. “They feared that local law enforcement responding to a crime they reported would take them too.”

Ceisler said tensions with ICE across the country also amplified those fears.

“We have seen good, law-abiding residents who are doing everything right to earn their citizenship detained and deported by the Trump administration,” Ceisler said.

In addition to terminating his office’s partnership with ICE, Ceisler also signed an additional order prohibiting his deputies from asking crime victims, witnesses, or court observers about their immigration status.

Despite the ending of the partnership, Ceisler insisted Bucks County will not be a so-called ""sanctuary county.""

“We will ensure that actual dangerous criminals who are in the country illegally are deported, which has been standard practice in Bucks County for decades,"" Ceisler said.

Officials also said the Bucks County Department of Corrections will continue to share information with ICE regarding its inmate population and ICE will also have 24/7 access to the county jail.

Wednesday afternoon, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson sent NBC10 a statement on Ceisler's decision.

""This announcement will only make law-abiding Bucks County residents less safe. Jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with ICE simply let illegal criminals roam their streets,"" Jackson wrote. ""These types of actions won't stop ICE and the federal government from enforcing the law, they will only make it significantly more challenging to get dangerous criminal illegals off American streets and put innocent Americans in harms way.""",https://media.nbcphiladelphia.com/2026/01/Danny-Ceisler-.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-15 05:58:20.964655

Officials say those agents have arrested around 2,500 people so far.

Outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, protests continue. Advocates say what's happening inside the courtrooms is also alarming.

A group of Minnesotans makes it their job to watch what happens. Known as court observers, they're a team dedicated to watching, listening and documenting.

Madeline Lohman is the advocacy director at The Advocates of Human Rights. She oversees court observers inside immigration courtrooms.

Their job is simple: monitor hearings like asylum claims and removal orders, providing a record of what happens.

""Courts are one of the places where people are supposed to access justice,"" Lohman said.

The group has conducted court monitoring since 2017. Observers typically sit in the back of the courtroom notebook and pen in hand, documenting how the hearing is unfolding and how the individual is treated during the proceeding. But advocates say this year has been the most challenging.

Lohman says since early 2025 access to court proceedings were limited, even at times doors were looked.

""They've spent really a lot of time in this administration to hide what they are doing to make it difficult to document,"" she said.

Lohman says when observers are granted access, they've seen injustices happening like people being denied to argue their case. Other times, names and complete case numbers are removed making it tough for observers to identify the person and follow the case.

That limitation is the reason why a demand letter from attorneys was sent to the courts Friday, putting them on notice.

Lohman said this week, observers were allowed inside the courtroom. But access to the lobby is still being denied.

However, state and local leaders, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have emphatically rejected those claims while demanding federal agents leave.

An analysis by USA TODAY of videos taken at the scene of the shooting show the situation unfolded. A nationwide poll conducted in the days after the shooting found more than half of voters thought the shooting was not justified.

Here's what to know about your rights if federal immigration enforcement agents show up at your door.

Do I have to open my door for ICE?

You don't have to let police officers or immigration agents into your home unless they have certain types of warrants.

If police have an arrest warrant, they're legally allowed to enter the home of the person on the warrant if they believe that person is inside, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. But a warrant of removal or deportation doesn't allow immigration agents to enter your home without your consent.

You have the right to remain silent even if the officer has a warrant.

What should I do if ICE is at my door?

To reduce the risk to yourself, stay calm and keep the door closed – opening the door doesn't give ICE permission to enter, the ACLU says, but it is safer to speak through the door.

Then, the ACLU recommends that you:

Ask if they are immigration agents and what they are there for.

Ask the agent or officer to show you a badge or identification through the window or peephole.

Ask if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If they say they do, ask them to slide it under the door or hold it up to a window so you can inspect it.

Don’t lie or produce any false documents, and don’t sign anything without speaking with a lawyer first.

State: “I do not consent to your entry.”

If agents force their way in, don't resist. If you wish to exercise your rights, state: “I do not consent to your entry or to your search of these premises. I am exercising my right to remain silent. I wish to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible.”

If you are on probation with a search condition, law enforcement is allowed to enter your home.","https://www.sctimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/USAT/88159939007-2256087844.jpg?crop=5812,3270,x0,y302&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 02:57:28.137127

Since taking office a year ago, U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy, involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards and screening immigrants' social media posts and past speeches.

Human rights groups have widely condemned Trump's immigration and travel-related policies, saying they harm due process guarantees and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies seek to improve domestic security.

ICE's actions have been subject to particular criticism by protesters, community leaders, Democrats and human rights advocates.

allows people from nations going through natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises to live and work temporarily in the United States.
Last year, Department of Homeland Security officials moved to terminate the T.P.S.","Immigrant rights lawyers on Wednesday urged a federal appeals court in California to affirm a district court’s order that would block the Trump administration from ending temporary deportation protections for about 600,000 Venezuelans in the United States.

In oral arguments before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, lawyers representing immigrants who had been covered under the protections said many of their clients had already lost their jobs and businesses as the program, known as Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., has been allowed to expire.

Hundreds of Venezuelans have been detained and deported, and parents are being separated from their American-born children, the lawyers said.

“We absolutely have shown harm in all 50 states,” Ahilan T. Arulanantham, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the panel at the hearing in Pasadena, Calif.

Sarah Welch, a lawyer with the Justice Department, urged the appeals court to overturn the district court order. She said the Supreme Court had already made two rare interventions on the issue, both favoring the Trump administration’s decision to end T.P.S.

In October, the Supreme Court temporarily stayed the district court ruling and allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its new policy while arguments continued in the lower courts. Whatever the Ninth Circuit decides, the outcome is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Ms. Welch said that Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, had followed appropriate legal procedures to reverse the Biden administration’s extensions of the initiative and that Ms. Noem had done so in the interest of national security.

The hearing came as the relationship between the United States and Venezuela is entering new territory.

At the beginning of January, the Trump administration conducted a military operation that captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and brought him to New York to stand trial. Since then, President Trump has asserted that the United States is running Venezuela, working with Mr. Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez.

On Thursday, an envoy sent by Ms. Rodríguez will visit Washington to explore reopening Venezuela’s embassy. On the same day, Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet with Venezuela’s top opposition leader, María Corina Machado.

Administration officials have sought to encourage Venezuelan immigrants to return to their native country, arguing that the removal of Mr. Maduro — a man whom American prosecutors accuse of being a narco-terrorist and a drug kingpin — would soon ensure a safer and more stable Venezuela.

The court case, brought by several T.P.S. holders and the National TPS Alliance, an advocacy organization, also seeks to preserve the protected status for roughly 330,000 Haitians that is slated to expire in February.

The hearing is the latest salvo in a wave of legal challenges around the country that are seeking to stop the Trump administration’s efforts to upend the T.P.S. program, slash the number of people admitted as refugees, dismantle the asylum process and end other humanitarian protections for immigrants.

Over the past year, Mr. Trump, long a skeptic of asylum seekers and refugees, has sought to drastically curb the forms of legal immigration, arguing that some petitioners are exploiting the programs and threatening national security.

Immigration lawyers and advocates say that the administration is embarking on the largest de-legalization effort in U.S. history as it seeks to expel millions of immigrants from the United States.

T.P.S. allows people from nations going through natural disasters, armed conflicts or other crises to live and work temporarily in the United States. For some recipients, the program had become all but permanent, as crises in their home countries have continued for decades.

Last year, Department of Homeland Security officials moved to terminate the T.P.S. program for more than a million people from Haiti, Venezuela and at least half a dozen other countries. This week, as more federal immigration agents descended upon Minnesota in the wake of a social services scandal implicating Somali Americans, the Trump administration announced that it would end T.P.S. for Somalis.

In the latest court filings, government lawyers argue that Ms. Noem initially moved to end the Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans because conditions in Venezuela had improved in critical areas, such as public health and the economy. But lawyers representing the T.P.S. holders countered that administration officials had not conducted a meaningful review of the country’s conditions, that Ms. Noem’s actions had violated federal legal procedures and that they were based on racial animus.

An estimated 130,000 Haiti-born residents and nearly 300,000 with Haitian roots live here, making Creole Florida’s third most spoken language.
For Michael Lambert, a TPS holder in the U.S. for nearly five decades, the situation takes a severe mental toll.
""Over 113,000 Haitian TPS [holders] are in the workforce in Florida alone,"" Petit said.
She noted that they contribute $1.3 billion in state and local taxes, while 63,000 TPS homeowners add $19 billion to housing values.","For Farah Larrieux, the United States is more than a place of residence. It is where she rebuilt her life.

A resident since 2005 and a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holder since the program was designated for Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, Larrieux sees herself as proof that TPS works. But with the program set to expire on Feb. 3, 2026, everything she has built is now in jeopardy.

""I’m one of the immigrants who contribute to the development of the United States, that the Trump administration wants to deport,"" Larrieux said during a vigil for the 16th anniversary of Haiti’s 2010 earthquake, hosted by Family Action Network Movement (FANM).

“TPS has changed my life,” she said. “The program has given me the opportunity to continue to build my life, develop my personal capacity and my career as a communication strategist and a social entrepreneur.”

Larrieux is one of approximately 350,000 Haitians whose legal right to live and work in the U.S. hangs in the balance after the Department of Homeland Security announced in November 2025 that Haiti no longer meets the TPS criteria. The administration argued that extending the designation would be “incompatible with national interests,” urging beneficiaries to prepare to leave the country or use the CBP Home app to “self-deport” — a program offering a free flight and a $3,000 stipend.

Living in a countdown

The looming deadline has sent shockwaves through South Florida, particularly in Miami-Dade County, home to the nation's largest Haitian diaspora. An estimated 130,000 Haiti-born residents and nearly 300,000 with Haitian roots live here, making Creole Florida’s third most spoken language.

At FANM, lead organizer Paul Christian Namphy said the dominant emotion is fear.

“It means great uncertainty,” Namphy said. “There is a lawsuit that has been launched to stop the administration from turning thousands of people's and families' lives upside down, but we don't know how that's going to go in court.”

Ongoing lawsuits, including Miot et al. v. Trump, argue that U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem violated administrative law and the Constitution by terminating Haiti’s TPS designation effective Feb. 3, 2026.

Dinah Escarment — a community advocate whose office, Escarment Multiservices, helps with immigration, and a Florida House candidate for the state’s 108th District — describes a community retreating into the shadows.

“They're telling me that they don't go to church anymore,"" Escarment said. ""Because they have fear, the one thing that's supposed to protect them and keep them safe, they feel like they don't even have access to that anymore.""

For Michael Lambert, a TPS holder in the U.S. for nearly five decades, the situation takes a severe mental toll.

“I’m a nervous wreck,” he said. “Every day, I look outside, I hear sirens, and I’m thinking they’re coming for me.”

According to Namphy, families face three impossible choices as the deadline approaches:

""Are you going to stay in the shadows, in fear, where at any moment anything can happen to you? Are you going to try to go to a third country? Or are you going to go to Haiti under very difficult conditions?""

Lambert represents the deep integration of TPS holders. He sold property in Haiti to build a life here, only to face losing it all. When asked about his plans following Feb. 3, Lambert said he feels he has no choice.

“If it is what it is, I would just have to go back to my country and try to avoid getting killed,” leaving his kids and wife behind, he said. “I don’t know, my marriage might end up being gone too, because out of sight.”

Reality on the ground

The U.S. government’s assertion that conditions in Haiti have improved enough to resume deportations stands in stark contrast to reports from human rights organizations. Since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, armed gangs have seized control of large parts of the country.

District 2 Miami-Dade Commissioner Marleine Bastien emphasized the deterioration of the island nation.

""It would have been encouraging to tell you that after 16 years, things are better,” she said. “Haiti is 10 times worse off than it was in 2010.”

She noted gangs control 90% of the capital with ""war weapons.” The U.N. human rights office reported at least 2,680 killings in early 2025, hundreds kidnapped, and sexual violence and child recruitment on the rise, while the International Organization for Migration found the number of displaced residents climbed to 1.4 million by October 2025.

“Young women and girls do not think about if they’re going to be raped,” Bastien said. “They think about when they’re going to be raped. This is a country at war.”

Recently, the Associated Pressreported that Doctors Without Borders suspended services at a Port-au-Prince clinic due to escalating violence.

“If TPS was given because of the earthquake and now the country is in worse shape, how can we plan to deport people who have lived their lives here, who work here?” Bastien asked.

A broken system

Larrieux said the deadline is only the latest chapter in a “broken” immigration system. She described a past residency interview that she said derailed her life.

""She (the immigration officer) coerced my husband at that time and forced him to sign a document to withdraw his petition, which could have granted me the permanent residency,"" Larrieux recalled.

Though the agent eventually interviewed Larrieux separately and ""finally realized that she had made a mistake,” Larrieux said officials lacked the ""moral conscience to fix the mistake,"" making the damage irreversible.

“It affected me for years, to the point that I fell into depression. I lost my hair, and I even became suicidal,” Larrieux said.

Most recently, the administration ended family-reunification parole programs and halted all immigration processes, including adjustment of status, for Haitians and nationals of 15 other countries.

“We are not undocumented by choice. We have been denied immigration reform by legislators, some of whom are children of immigrants who have benefited from immigration reform in the past,” Larrieux said.

Economic fallout

Beyond the human toll, advocates warn of severe economic consequences.

“Without immigrants, South Florida doesn’t exist,” Namphy said. “Immigrants are essential to our way of life, to our economy, to hotels, restaurants, and basic health structures.”

Tessa Petit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, highlighted the financial stakes.

""Over 113,000 Haitian TPS [holders] are in the workforce in Florida alone,"" Petit said.

She noted that they contribute $1.3 billion in state and local taxes, while 63,000 TPS homeowners add $19 billion to housing values.

Escarment says the labor market is already contracting.

""A lot of my clients have lost their jobs since last year,"" she noted. ""The employers are like, 'You're not going to be able to work here long, then I'll have to hire someone else.'""

What’s next?

Community leaders are demanding legislative courage. Namphy criticized local officials who claim to support constituents while cooperating with federal deportation efforts.

“They have a choice now. Many of them are choosing to harm our communities,"" Namphy said.

Escarment, eyeing a seat in the state legislature, believes a pragmatic, financial approach is the only language the administration understands. She proposes a ""pay for status"" model through which long-term residents pay a fee to regularize their status.

""The administration hears money, so we have to talk in their language,"" Escarment argued. ""Think about all these people. It's a win-win because we're going to try to pay for it anyway.”

Larrieux called on the White House to recognize immigrant contributions.

“We deserve a pathway to an adjustment of status,” Larrieux said. “The United States is a land built by immigrants and served by immigrants. We immigrants also make America great.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d846cb4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1476x775+0+104/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2Fe8%2F2cbd9dc44624909fc79084d79452%2F69671924144c0-image.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:59:12.293083

The big picture: Americans are showing signs of discomfort about the far-reaching federal intervention of ICE and Border Patrol, with major cities like Boston and Phoenix anticipating agent arrivals.

That expanded intervention has so far led to thousands of arrests across the country, a CEO's resignation, employees forced out of their workplaces and protesters directly arguing with federal agents, attracting criticism from lawmakers and prominent podcasters from Joe Rogan to comedian Tim Dillon.

""These are not well-trained law enforcement people in ICE,"" Dillon said. ""They're not the cream of the crop.""

By the numbers: A majority of Americans say ICE is making the country less safe rather than more safe (47% vs 34%), according to an Economist and YouGov poll released Tuesday and conducted from Jan. 9-12.

The same poll found that a majority of Americans say shooting Good was not justified (50% vs. 30%), while 20% were unsure.

Here are five flashpoint moments to know.

Renee Good shooting in Minnesota

An ICE officer shot and killed Good, a 37-year-old mother, in early January during ""targeted operations"" in Minneapolis, Axios previously reported.

Good was not the target of the enforcement activity, law enforcement officials said at the time.

The shooting came amid a surge of immigration enforcement in Minnesota, which included thousandsof agents entering the state.

Protesters took to the streets nationwide for ""ICE Out For Good"" protests and vigils after the fatal shooting.

DHS, DOJ investigations into ICE shooting

Tension has bubbled as federal authorities indicated they wouldn't probe the officer's conduct in the Minnesota shooting.

There's ""currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation,"" Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Tuesday.

Federal investigators have restricted Minnesota investigators' access to case materials and put the FBI in charge of the probe.

What they're saying: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has defended the shooting, calling Good's actions an ""act of domestic terrorism"" before any investigation concluded.

""As we uncover more of this criminal activity, we're going to continue to surge resources to make sure this abuse of government funds and government power no longer continues in Minnesota,"" Noem said, per CBS News.

The other side: More than 50 lawmakers signaled support for articles of impeachment against Noem.

""Secretary Noem is failing the American people by threatening, intimidating, and harassing my neighbors and I believe she must be removed from office,"" said Rep. Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.).

CBP shooting in Portland

A separate shooting incident involving federal agents in Portland further added to the mounting tension.

Federal officials said the two people who were shot were trying to harm Border Patrol agents. But local officials decried the incident as an example of federal law enforcement overreach.

Though not an ICE incident — ICE and Border Patrol are different entities — the shooting happened a day after Good's killing, giving protesters more fuel for their demonstrations.

Minnesota woman ripped from car in viral video

A woman in Minneapolis was arrested Tuesday after allegedly impeding an ICE operation in the city, according to multiple reports.

In a video with more than 3.3 million views on X, the woman can be seen near ICE vehicles while driving close to a protest. The agents then yanked the woman from her car in a chaotic scene.

As the woman was dragged away from her car, she can be heard yelling: ""I'm disabled, I'm trying to go to the doctor up there, that's why I couldn't move. I am an autistic disabled person, I'm trying to go to the doctor.""

Oglala Sioux Tribe accuses ICE of holding members

The Oglala Sioux Tribe, which is one of the largest Indigenous tribal nations in the U.S., accused ICE of illegally holding tribal members who were picked up during Minnesota raids, Axios reports.

Oglala Sioux Tribe president Frank Star Comes Out wrote in a memo to federal officials that the tribal members should be released.

The four men who were picked up were homeless, he wrote.

Zoom in: Star Comes Out said that federal officials told the tribal nation that they would receive information about the detained tribal members only if the tribe entered into an agreement with ICE.

The tribe declined.

For more on ICE's operations in Minnesota, I'm joined now by the state's attorney general. That is Keith Ellison.

Attorney General Ellison, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for joining us.

Keith Ellison, Minnesota Attorney General:

Thanks for having me.

Amna Nawaz:

So, I want to begin with a little legal news today, because I know your office had asked a federal judge to temporarily block a surge of ICE agents to the Minneapolis area. The judge declined to rule today, giving DOJ until Monday to respond.

So does that mean that another surge of agents is on their way? And what are you anticipating in the way of the size and scope of that new surge?

Keith Ellison:

Well, it certainly does mean that they have a little bit more time to search, which concerns me, because the searching they have done so far has been destructive, not helpful to anybody. It has risked public safety. It has depleted public resources. It has increased fear.

And It has eroded Americans' confidence in their government and has been a whole -- wholly a failure in every conceivable way. So I am a little disappointed. But I believe that this is a wonderful judge, who's a deeply thoughtful person, who really just wants to make sure the best decision she can make.

And that takes time. No doubt, however, that, as time is of the essence, right, and we need relief from this surge, this dramatic escalation founded on lies and untruths, which is doing so much damage.

Amna Nawaz:

I also want to put to you another piece of news today. We heard from the Border Patrol, Bovino, who said on FOX the Department of Justice is also sending additional prosecutors to Minnesota to process those immigration cases. What's your reaction to that?

Keith Ellison:

Well, I mean, quite honestly, I mean, it -- I'm not shocked, because the -- President Trump is making sure that he is targeting our state, which is odd because we are not a state that has the most immigration in America.

Many other states have dramatically higher rates of immigration than we do. We do have some, and we're very proud of our neighbors who've chosen to make America their home. But I guess I'm not surprised that we're getting unwarranted, unasked-for attention from President Trump.

He's made it very clear that, because he believes that he won Minnesota three times, but in fact lost it, he's upset about that, has repeated that numerous times. So we expect the persecution will continue while he operates the way he's operating.

Amna Nawaz:

You heard there the border czar...

(Crosstalk)

Amna Nawaz:

Sorry. Go ahead.

Keith Ellison:

Or until a court tells him he can no longer do it.

Amna Nawaz:

Well, you probably heard in our report there the border czar Tom Homan telling my colleague Liz Landers that this is about what they call their your sanctuary policies in Minnesota and Minneapolis.

Specifically, there is this idea of not honoring an ICE detainer, meaning, if there's an undocumented person in city or state custody in Minnesota, they're not handed over to ICE. And I do want to point out that you did issue in an informal opinion last year, you wrote that Minnesota law prohibits law enforcement from holding someone on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody.

So what does that otherwise released from custody mean? Do you ever hand people over to ICE or not?

Keith Ellison:

Well, what it means is that we comply with the law and the Constitution of the United States of America and the state of Minnesota.

And I would submit to you that Minnesota is not a sanctuary city. We have never claimed to be a sanctuary city. We have never claimed to be a sanctuary state. What we do is, we devote all of our state resources to state matters and that the federal government has its responsibility. We don't interfere with them, but we don't devote state resources to federal projects like immigration enforcement.

So we don't really -- so this idea of some sort of a sanctuary state is a misnomer. We have never claimed that. And I think it's wholly -- I think the voters and the taxpayers of our state expect that the resources of our state will be devoted for the purposes of our state and that the federal government, they're paid to do their job and we don't interfere with them doing it.

We also don't do their job for them.

Amna Nawaz:

Before we go, I want to briefly ask you too about the ongoing investigation into the shooting and killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent.

I know Minnesota officials were shut out of the federal investigation. Your office has since launched essentially a parallel probe. You have probably seen the news of DHS saying that the ICE officer was injured and suffered internal bleeding. My question to you is, are you going to have any access to any of these medical records, the agent, any other evidence, body camera footage?

And, if not, how can your office carry out a thorough investigation on this issue?

Keith Ellison:

Well, I will just point out that all we have been asking for is a fair, free, open investigation. How they would make such a claim without producing a medical record to prove it I find curious and why in the world they would not just do the investigation.

We have heard that the Department of Justice Civil Rights Department has been excluded from doing the investigation. These people know the most about these cases in the federal government, yet they're not doing the case.

And at the same time, they're reject -- they're stopping the state from doing the work that we're supposed to do. I do not necessarily take the word of those people. I will take the word of a trained medical professional who's made a diagnosis and a medical record made for the purpose of diagnosis and medical treatment.

But I'm not going to just take the word of some nameless, faceless bureaucrat who's just -- I don't know. But, I mean, let me just say this.

I find it interesting that the federal government, the federal authorities shut the state of Minnesota out from the investigation, will not let the most expert people in their own institution investigate the case, but like to -- like to send out little pieces of information that they believe benefit them, like the video that is purported to be from Jonathan Ross and now this non-medical personnel giving testimony or giving public statements about medical conditions.

So I will stop right there.

Amna Nawaz:

That is Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison joining us tonight.

""California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.""","A federal court has upheld the new congressional map approved by California voters last month, giving Democrats a chance to counter the nationwide redistricting effort led by President Trump and his Republican allies.

The court challenge to the redistricting plan had been brought by the California Republican Party and the U.S. Department of Justice. The court found that the new district map did not violate laws against racial gerrymandering.

The Republicans argued that the new map was motivated by a desire to increase the voting power of Latinos. The court, in a two-to-one ruling, rejected that claim, noting that voters approved the measure, called ""Proposition 50"" and there was no evidence they acted on racial grounds.

""The evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats,"" wrote U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton in the majority opinion.

The court denied the Republican plaintiffs' request the court issue an injunction blocking the redistricting as the case proceeds to a final judgement. The Republicans could still appeal the ruling.

Usually states redistrict early in the decade after the decennial census. But Trump set off a mid-decade redistricting race as he tries to prevent Democrats from taking control of the House. This summer he pushed Texas Republicans to redraw that state's districts, potentially helping the GOP win five House seats in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina have each redistricted to help the GOP in one seat.

After the Texas redistricting, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to respond by redrawing the map in his state. At his urging, lawmakers put the matter on the ballot and California voters approved a redistricting plan there in a special election Nov. 4. That measure passed with 64 percent of the vote.

For Democrats, it's been about confronting Trump

For Democrats who supported California's redistricting measure, it was not as much about redrawn lines as it was an ideological battle. Supporters largely viewed it as an opportunity for the blue state to push back against the Trump administration. Newsom argued the approach was necessary to counter the GOP-led redistricting effort in Texas and ""fight fire with fire"" and boost Democrats' chances ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The Republican-led lawsuit against the measure contended it violated the law by disproportionately giving the state's Latino voters a stronger voice over other racial voting blocs.

In a dissenting opinion, Judge Kenneth Lee, who was appointed by President Trump in 2018, said the designer of the map, hired by the Democrats, had publicly said that he was aiming to boost Latino voting power.

""The Democratic supermajority in the California state legislature wanted to curry favor with Latino groups and voters—and to prevent Latino voters from drifting away from the party,"" Lee wrote.

The majority ruling rejected that argument, finding that it was not the mapmaker or even the legislature that held the deciding power but rather the voters on the proposition and that it was debated by proponents and opponents as a partisan move.

In her opinion, Staton, appointed to the bench by President Obama, found a ""mountain of evidence produced by Defendants that the voters intended to enact a partisan gerrymander.""

""Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed,"" wrote Newsom in a statement. ""California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 – to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas – and that is exactly what this court concluded.""

Overall, the redistricting race is close with Republicans on track to tilt a couple or few more seats their way than Democrats have. Indiana Republicans refused to follow Trump's lead last month and redistrict there. But Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has vowed to lead his state in drawing a new map that will favor the GOP.

Meanwhile, Virginia Democrats have started the redistricting process to favor their party in that state. Currently, the House stands at 218 Republicans and 213 Democrats and if Democrats take control, they could slow Trump's agenda or launch investigations into his administration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8253x4642+0+430/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff3%2F5d%2F3c49cc9043eeac66acbac65f3c2b%2Fap25309666893880.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 00:59:16.910989

Prompted by press reports about the policy shift, nonprofits Carolina Migrant Network and Amica Center for Immigrant Rights sought a June 9 memo and related field guidance containing a directive to place ankle monitors on everyone enrolled in the program, except pregnant women, according to their suit.

The groups first sought the documents, which they said have not been made public yet, through a Freedom of Information Act request filed Oct. 28, but sued after the agency failed to act on the request, they said.

The groups say ICE ""has a great deal of discretion"" to release immigrants with pending immigration court hearings into the community through the Alternatives to Detention, or ATD, program, which uses various forms of monitoring to ensure immigrants show up to those hearings.

Carolina Migrant Network and Amica says the program has ballooned over the past five years, with 181,000 immigrants enrolled as of December, nearly three times the number of detained immigrants.

Of those enrolled in the program, the groups said 36,000 are wearing ankle monitors, double the number as of the end of 2024.

Even though ICE has said the ATD program is meant to boost compliance, the groups cited reports showing that enrollees actually have lower compliance rates. They also said the use of ankle monitors inflicts serious financial, physical and psychological harms, disrupting day-to-day life and at times causing injuries and worsening health conditions.

A study cited in the complaint found that 60% of ATD program participants wearing ankle monitors reported severe ""impact"" to their health, the groups said.

""As media reporting on ATD makes apparent, ICE's true purpose in imposing a blanket 'ankle monitoring for all' policy is the goal of coercing noncitizens into accepting 'voluntary' deportation,"" they said.

Counsel for the groups and for ICE did not return requests for comment on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged an arrest detainer for Aristides Eli Orellana-Ramirez, a criminal illegal alien from El Salvador charged for murdering two teenagers.

Bravlio Galeano Ayala

Samir Canales Molina

According to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department, a violent shooting occurred on December 20, 2025, where two individuals were shot and later pronounced dead at the hospital. Bravlio Galeano Ayala, 16, and Samir Canales Molina, 18, were identified as the victims.

According to local reports, the shootings happened around 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, December 20, 2025, in southwest Charlotte. The two teens were found more than six miles away from each other, but detectives believe they were “shot at the same location during the same incident and then traveled away from the scene in an attempt to find help.”

Aristides Eli Orellana-Ramirez

“Another tragic loss of life at the hands of a criminal illegal alien. The two male victims were just 16 and 18 years old, both with a whole life ahead of them. Their lives were ripped away in moments by a criminal illegal alien who should have NEVER been in our country in the first place,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin “ICE lodged an arrest detainer. Unfortunately, North Carolina’s sanctuary politicians often REFUSE to allow us into their jails and release these known criminals back into American communities. President Trump and Secretary Noem launched Operation Charlotte’s Web to target these criminals and get them out of American neighborhoods.”

Orellana-Ramirez illegally crossed the border at an unknown date and location and without inspection by an immigration officer.

Together, The laws bar law enforcement officers from wearing masks and compel them to display identification “while conducting law enforcement operations in the Golden State.” Both offenses would be misdemeanors.

If allowed to take effect, California would become the first state in the nation to block ICE agents and other federal law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty.","A top Trump administration lawyer pressed a federal judge Wednesday to block a newly enacted California law that bans most law enforcement officers in the state from wearing masks, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Tiberius Davis, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, argued at a hearing in Los Angeles that the first-of-its-kind ban on police face coverings could unleash chaos across the country, and potentially land many ICE agents on the wrong side of the law it were allowed to take effect.

“Why couldn’t California say every immigration officer needs to wear pink, so it’s super obvious who they are?” Davis told U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder. “The idea that all 50 states can regulate the conduct and uniforms of officers ... flips the Constitution on its head.”

The judge appeared skeptical.

“Why can’t they perform their duties without a mask? They did that until 2025, did they not?” Snyder said. “How in the world do those who don’t mask manage to operate?”

The administration first sued to block the new rules in November, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the No Secret Police Act and its companion provision, the No Vigilantes Act, into law. Together, The laws bar law enforcement officers from wearing masks and compel them to display identification “while conducting law enforcement operations in the Golden State.” Both offenses would be misdemeanors.

Federal officials have vowed to defy the new rules, saying they are unconstitutional and put agents in danger. They have also decried an exception in the law for California state peace officers, arguing the carve out is discriminatory. The California Highway Patrol is among those exempted, while city and county agencies, including the Los Angeles Police Department, must comply.

“These were clearly and purposefully targeted at the federal government,” Davis told the court Wednesday. “Federal officers face prosecution if they do not comply with California law, but California officers do not.”

The hearing comes at a moment of acute public anger at the agency following the fatal shooting of American protester Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis — rage that has latched on to masks as a symbol of perceived lawlessness and impunity.

“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” California Department of Justice lawyer Cameron Bell told the court Wednesday. “The state has had to bear the cost of the federal government’s actions. These are very real consequences.”

She pointed to declarations from U.S. citizens who believed they were being abducted by criminals when confronted by masked immigration agents, including incidents where local police were called to respond.

“I later learned that my mother and sister witnessed the incident and reported to the Los Angeles Police Department that I was kidnapped,” Angeleno Andrea Velez said in one such declaration. “Because of my mother’s call, LAPD showed up to the raid.”

The administration argues the anti-mask law would put ICE agents and other federal immigration enforcement officers at risk of doxing and chill the “zealous enforcement of the law.”

“The laws would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities,” the government said in court filings.

Davis also told the court that ICE‘s current tactics were necessary in part because of laws across California and in much of the U.S. that limit police cooperation with ICE and bar immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, such as schools and courts.

California contends its provisions are “modest” and aligned with past practice, and that the government’s evidence showing immigration enforcement would be harmed is thin.

Bell challenged Department of Homeland Security statistics purporting to show an 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE agents and a 1,000% increase in assaults, saying the government has recently changed what qualifies as a “threat” and that agency claims have faced “significant credibility issues” in federal court.

“Blowing a whistle to alert the community, that’s hardly something that increases threats,” Bell said.

On the identification rule, Snyder appeared to agree.

“One might argue that there’s serious harm to the government if agents’ anonymity is preserved,” she said.

The fate of the mask law may hinge on the peace officer exemption.

“Would your discrimination argument go away if the state changed legislation to apply to all officers?” Snyder asked.

“I believe so,” Davis said.

The ban was slated to come into force on Jan. 1, but is on hold while the case makes its way through the courts. If allowed to take effect, California would become the first state in the nation to block ICE agents and other federal law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty.

There’s some evidence to suggest those efforts haven’t worked, at least not yet.

Perhaps the most surprising area of conflict between Mr. Blakeman and Ms. Hochul involved a topic on which they ostensibly agree.","As the presumptive Republican candidate for governor of New York, Bruce Blakeman could be expected to find flaws in Gov. Kathy Hochul’s State of the State address.

Appearing in the State Capitol on Wednesday, a day after the annual address, he criticized the Democratic governor’s record on crime, complained about taxes and derided her child care agenda as a New York City giveaway.

But perhaps the starkest difference between them was in their stances on the killing of Renee Good by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis last week, which Ms. Hochul has portrayed as an outrage.

“When you look at both videos, it looks like the individual that was shot, that person was engaged in trying to run down the ICE officer,” Mr. Blakeman told reporters in Albany, with the caveat that he would like to see a full investigation.

And he mused that a similar incident, which he said had resulted from a lack of respect for law enforcement, could happen in New York City, now being led by Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist.

It was a striking warning that underscored the differences between the visions of the state offered by Mr. Blakeman and Ms. Hochul ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The remarks came as Mr. Blakeman, the Nassau County executive, made his first trip to Albany as a candidate for governor. The visit was somewhat ill-timed: Scheduling conflicts (his own inauguration) kept Mr. Blakeman away from the Capitol on Tuesday; by the time he arrived in Albany, most of the Legislature had left for the weekend, leaving a single Republican assemblyman to stand by his side.

Mr. Blakeman announced his intention to run for governor last month, leading to a tense behind-the-scenes dance among state Republicans, a vast majority of whom had already committed to supporting Representative Elise Stefanik. But his candidacy received a boost from President Trump, who undermined Ms. Stefanik’s bid by declining to endorse her. Shortly after, she announced that she would not run for governor, or seek re-election to Congress.

On Wednesday, Mr. Blakeman, a staunch Trump ally, made his loyalty clear. “I support a lot of his policies, if not all of his policies,” he told the reporters gathered outside the press room on the third floor of the Capitol.

That seemed to include the president’s cutting and withholding of billions of dollars in city and state resources.

Mr. Trump said on Tuesday that he would withhold all funds from states like New York that contain so-called sanctuary cities, where local law enforcement officers are largely barred from helping federal immigration authorities. It was the latest in a series of Trump administration threats to cut funds for infrastructure, health care, social services and counterterrorism.

Asked about the cuts on Wednesday, Ms. Hochul took a hard line. “This is just a threat to intimidate states like New York into bowing into submission, and that is something we’ll never do,” she said, noting that the state already cooperates with immigration authorities on criminal investigations.

But Mr. Blakeman disagreed, arguing that the president was right to withhold the funds.

“The problem is not with President Trump,” he said. “The problem is with the mayor and the City Council. You want to be a sanctuary city, you want to violate federal law, there are consequences.” He added later that he didn’t “want to put any shackles on ICE.”

Even so, Mr. Blakeman veered from the president’s insistence that prices have been falling and affordability is not an issue.

“It’s grocery bills, utility costs, rent, property taxes, and paychecks that don’t go far enough,” Mr. Blakeman said in a statement. “Families don’t need more rhetoric — they need results.”

And while Ms. Hochul has put forth a slate of programs, from energy assistance and auto insurance reform to universal child care and free school lunches, Mr. Blakeman said she had not done enough, and he promised to cut taxes if elected governor.

Mr. Blakeman is expected to replicate the strategy that his fellow Long Island Republican Lee Zeldin used to come within six percentage points of the governor’s mansion in 2022, prioritizing affordability issues and crime.

But on that front he may well face challenges: Crime in New York is down from its post-pandemic peak, when Mr. Zeldin was running. Ms. Hochul appeared at a news conference last week to trumpet a 20 percent decline in murders in the city. The decline came amid a 3 percent drop in major crime categories (the one exception was reported rapes, which increased partly because of a new broader definition of sexual assault).

The court did not announce the next date when it will issue rulings. It does not announce in advance which rulings will be released on a given date.

The challenge to Trump's tariffs marks a major test of presidential powers as well as of the court's willingness to check some of the Republican president's far-reaching assertions of authority since he returned to office in January 2025. The outcome will impact the global economy.

During arguments in the case on November 5, conservative and liberal justices appeared to cast doubt on the legality of the tariffs, which Trump imposed by invoking a 1977 law meant for use during national emergencies. Trump's administration is appealing rulings by lower courts that he overstepped his authority.

Yanira Cardona, the city’s Hispanic Outreach Coordinator appointed by Mayor Donna Deegan, said early Wednesday that people who are taken in should “comply,” but they should have a plan because “they’re out in Jacksonville.”

By the end of the day, a Deegan spokesperson said Cardona was on leave while the administration addressed the matter.

Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, who had joined three other Republicans to advance the resolution alongside Democrats last week, flipped after they said they received assurances from the Trump administration.

With Hawley and Young’s votes, the Senate was split 50-50 on the resolution. JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote. Republican senators Rand Paul, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins cast their votes for the war powers resolution alongside Democrats.

Senate Democrats forcefully condemned Republican opposition to the resolution, which aimed to check the president as he threatens further action in other countries including Greenland, Iran and Mexico.

“Make no mistake about it: this vote makes things more dangerous, not less,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said. “It emboldens Donald Trump to push further down this reckless path.”

Tim Kaine, the Democratic senator from Virginia who has championed several war powers measures, said he was prepared to file “a whole lot more” to block Trump from carrying out military operations without congressional authorization.

“They can run but they can’t hide,” he said, referring to Republicans, whose support would be needed to approve the resolutions.

The president had put intense pressure on his fellow Republicans to vote down the measure that would have checked his ability to carry out further military attacks on Venezuela.

Trump lashed out at the five Republican senators who joined with Democrats to advance the resolution last week. Yet even the possibility that the Republican-controlled Senate would defy Trump on such a high-profile vote revealed the growing alarm on Capitol Hill about the president’s expanding foreign policy ambitions.

Democrats forced the vote after US troops captured the deposed Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month.

Young, one of five Republicans who voted with Democrats last week, says he now sides with Trump.

In a statement, Young said he “has received assurances that there are no American troops in Venezuela” after speaking with secretary of state Marco Rubio, and that if Trump were to pursue “major military operations”, he would ask Congress “in advance for an authorization of force”.

Hawley similarly told reporters that he had been persuaded after discussion with both Rubio and Trump that the resolution was no longer necessary.

The defeat comes less than a week after the US Senate advanced a bipartisan war powers resolution to prevent Trump from taking further military action against Venezuela, after Trump authorized a pre-dawn raid to capture its leader, Nicolás Maduro, without giving Congress advance notice. The vote amounted to a rare rebuke of the president, and Trump responded by saying that the Republican senators who supported the resolution “should never be elected to office again”.

Wednesday’s vote hinged on a procedural maneuver challenging the resolution’s relevance based on the fact that no US troops were currently deployed in Venezuela. The motion allowed Young and Hawley to vote to kill the resolution without abandoning their initial objections to military action in Venezuela.

Paul, a libertarian long opposed to US military intervention abroad, called it an “absurdity” to argue Trump hadn’t already taken actions of war in Venezuela. “If we don’t know it’s a war until after all the people die ... wouldn’t it then be a little late?” he told reporters in advance of the vote.

Senator Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, said it was necessary for Congress to reassert its role and put a check on presidential authority that had “atrophied” under recent administrations.

Meanwhile, on social media, senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, accused Republicans of voting in favor of “forever wars, and against the best interests of the American people”.

The Trump Administration has taken action to share Medicaid data provided by states to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for immigration enforcement purposes. This action represents a reversal in prior policy that asserted CMS would not share such information and ICE would not use such information for immigration enforcement purposes, including assurances made to the public, applicants and enrollees, health care providers, and states that information collected to determine eligibility for health coverage programs would not be used for immigration enforcement.

This issue brief provides an overview of a new data sharing agreement for CMS to share Medicaid data with ICE and its potential implications. This sharp departure in policy to allow sharing of Medicaid enrollee data with ICE for immigration enforcement raises several key issues:

Data limitations may make it difficult for CMS to comply with a current court order to share data only for individuals who are not lawfully present for the 20 plaintiff states challenging the data sharing. Under pending litigation, CMS is prohibited from sharing certain information from the plaintiff states, including information for lawfully present individuals or citizens. If the data available to CMS are similar to the data researchers have access to, it is not possible to isolate immigrants who are not lawfully present in the dataset that will be shared with ICE.

Going forward, the sharing of Medicaid enrollee data with ICE will likely make immigrant families, including citizen children in those families, more reluctant to access health coverage and care and other programs and services. The policy exacerbates already heightened fears among immigrant families due to increased immigration enforcement activity overall. Even prior to the public notice of the new data sharing policy, the KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants found that about half (51%) of immigrant adults were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that health officials or health care providers may share their information with ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

The data sharing raises broader questions and concerns about data privacy and protections, which may extend beyond immigrant families. Individuals enrolled in Medicaid did so under prior assurances that information would not be shared for immigration enforcement purposes. Applying new policy retroactively to people who took actions under previous policy and safeguards may broadly increase concerns about privacy and safeguards of data. Health care providers, including community health centers and hospitals, may also have growing concerns about potentially being required to share patient information.

What Medicaid data do states report to CMS?

Medicaid is jointly administered by the federal government and states, and states must share certain information with CMS for program administration. State Medicaid agencies collect and maintain personal and health information for applicants and enrollees to determine eligibility and provide care. Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid or other federally-funded coverage, but payments for emergency services may be made to hospitals on behalf of individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status. States include information about these payments in their reports to CMS. Some states provide health coverage to some immigrants regardless of immigration status using state-only funds. However, states are not required to submit this state-only program information to CMS. States cannot require applicants to provide citizenship or immigration status for any family or household members not applying for coverage.

Under the data sharing agreement, CMS will be sharing data from the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System or T-MSIS with ICE, which provides robust information on Medicaid enrollees but is significantly lagged. T-MSIS data also are made available to researchers, providing insight into what data it includes. The data available to researchers are generally almost two years old (e.g., calendar year 2024 data are available in 2026) and include demographic and eligibility files with information on age, gender, race and ethnicity, Medicaid eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, and coverage through Medicaid managed care. There are also claims files that include claims for all services covered by the states, premium payments from the states to managed care plans, and records of services used by managed care enrollees. In some cases, states provide more data to the federal government than are made available to researchers such as KFF. It is likely that CMS has access to more timely data too, but it is unknown how timely those data are and the extent to which timeliness varies across the states.

In the T-MSIS data available to researchers, there are a few types of information related to immigration status, but no indicator that allows for separate identification of immigrants who are undocumented. Specifically, T-MSIS includes the following data elements:

Immigration status, which indicates whether a person is one of the following:

“A qualified alien,” which is a specific subset of noncitizens with lawful immigration status, such as lawful permanent residents (LPRs or “green card” holders), who may be eligible for Medicaid and CHIP and certain other federal programs. Many must wait five years after obtaining qualified status before they may enroll in coverage.

“Lawfully present under CHIPRA 214,” which includes lawfully residing pregnant people and children in states that have taken up the option to eliminate the five-year wait to enroll in coverage for eligible immigrants with qualified status and extend coverage to lawfully present pregnant people and/or children beyond those with a qualified status.

“Eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services,” which includes individuals who would otherwise be eligible for Medicaid but for their immigration status. This group includes undocumented immigrants, noncitizen immigrants with a qualified status who are in the five-year waiting period for coverage, and lawfully present immigrants without a qualified status.

“A U.S. citizen or U.S. national.”

Whether or not the enrollee’s immigration status has been verified, and

The date on which the five-year waiting period for receiving Medicaid and other federally funded benefits ends.

Undocumented immigrants are included in the population that is “eligible for payment of emergency Medicaid services,” but that group also includes some groups of lawfully present immigrants, and the dataset available to researchers does not separately identify these groups within that population. Additionally, because of the data lag, immigration status may have changed for some people since the data were collected.

What actions has the Trump Administration taken to share Medicaid enrollee data?

In July 2025, CMS and ICE established an Information Exchange Agreement that enables immigration enforcement officials to access the personal data of millions of Medicaid enrollees. A news organization made the agreement public in January 2026, after it was released as part of a lawsuit several states brought against the Department of Health and Human Services and DHS. Under the agreement, CMS will provide ICE, “access to the CMS Integrated Data Repository to retrieve information concerning the identify and location of aliens in the United States.” The agreement indicates this information will allow ICE to, “receive information concerning the identity and location of aliens in the United States, such as address, telephone number, banking information (routing number, account type, account number), email address, internet protocol (IP) addresses and other information relevant to identifying and locating aliens in the United States.”

The agreement specifies that CMS will provide direct access to the T-MSIS to a select set of ICE employees for renewable two-month periods, and that ICE employees will access the T-MSIS to receive information concerning the identification and location of aliens in the U.S. It identifies Medicaid recipients’ name, address, Medicaid identification number, social security number, date of birth, sex, phone number, locality, ethnicity and race as the data elements to be shared. The agreement does not specify whether ICE access to Medicaid data is limited to a certain subset of Medicaid enrollees, such as noncitizens. As such, the agreement could provide ICE employees access to these data for all Medicaid enrollees, regardless of their immigration status. Also, the stated purpose of the access is to identify and locate aliens in the United States, not specifically those who are undocumented.

This action represents a reversal in prior policy that asserted CMS would not share and ICE would not use health coverage eligibility information for immigration enforcement purposes. Under this prior policy, ICE, CMS, and states made assurances to the public, applicants and enrollees, and health care providers that information collected to determine eligibility for and administer health coverage programs, including Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace, would not be used for immigration enforcement. CMS previously stated on its website that the information regarding individuals that it collects will only be used for administration of its programs: “To protect your privacy, we’ll tell you before we collect any personal information we need to run our health care programs and only use it for that purpose.” CMS also previously stated on its website that it will not use immigration status for immigration enforcement purposes: “We won’t use any immigration status you share with us for immigration enforcement purposes.”

A preliminary injunction temporarily halted the Trump Administration’s actions to share Medicaid enrollee data with ICE in some states. In June 2025, there were reports that the Trump administration shared the personal and health data of millions of noncitizen Medicaid enrollees living in California, Illinois, Washington, and D.C. with immigration enforcement officials. Following court challenges, a preliminary injunction temporarily blocked the data sharing in the 20 plaintiff states challenging the data sharing in August 2025. The court found that while “there does not appear to be anything categorically unlawful about DHS obtaining data from agencies like HHS for immigration enforcement, that the data sharing was implemented without a “reasoned decision making process” and likely violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). The injunction did not govern data sharing in other states that are not involved in the lawsuit.

On November 25, 2025, CMS issued anoticeoutlining its plans to begin sharing Medicaid data it receives from states with DHS and ICE once the preliminary injunction is lifted. The notice specifies that ICE, “contemplates requesting from CMS available biographical, contact, and location information, though ICE reserved the right, in a specific case, to consider requesting other information on a case-by-case basis as permitted by law.” CMS indicates that the notice makes the public aware that it intends to disclose certain information to DHS and that it will update relevant websites to reflect its authority to share information with DHS. CMS asserts that the policy change is exempt from a notice and comment period because it is a policy statement outlining actions that are consistent with federal law. ICE also issued a policy memorandum to rescind its previous policy of not using health coverage eligibility information to pursue immigration enforcement action.

In December 2025, the court updated its ruling, allowing CMS to share a subset of information it intends to share as outlined in the CMS notice. Under the injunction, CMS may only share information with DHS and ICE that is associated with the Medicaid program (not any other health programs); pertains only to individuals who are not lawfully present in the U.S.; and is limited to citizenship and immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID. It prohibits the sharing of any additional information, such as health information, or information related to lawfully present individuals or citizens and precludes sharing additional information that may be requested on a case-by-case basis. It also specifies that, “to the extent that such basic biographical, contact, or location information about unlawfully present aliens is not severable from other information that DHS and ICE are not entitled to obtain (e.g., information about lawful permanent residents or citizens, sensitive health records), HHS or CMS may not share it.” The injunction only applies in the 20 plaintiff states involved in the lawsuit, meaning the data sharing can proceed as outlined in the agreement and notice in other states.

Issues to Consider

Courts will ultimately determine the legality of the data sharing policy within the context of existing data privacy and protection laws. Beyond that determination, there are also issues to consider regarding how the data sharing policy can be operationalized in ways consistent with what the courts have allowed so far and broader implications for families, health care providers, and states.

Data limitations may make it difficult for CMS to comply with the current court order to share data only for individuals who are not lawfully present for the 20 states challenging the data sharing agreement. If the T-MSIS data available to CMS are similar to the data researchers have access to, it is not possible to isolate immigrants who are not lawfully present. Existing T-MSIS data elements identify individuals eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services. However, any data shared with ICE using that identifier will include people who are lawfully present (those subject to the five-year waiting period and those who do not have qualified status) as well as individuals who are not lawfully present. The data may also include some individuals who may not have been lawfully present at the time their information was entered into the system, but who have since transitioned to lawfully present status. In the future, the 2025 reconciliation law’s restrictions on Medicaid eligibility for certain lawfully present immigrants (including refugees and asylees among others), which begin in October 2026, will mean that the share of lawfully present immigrants identified as eligible only for payment of emergency Medicaid services will increase.

Going forward, the sharing of health coverage data with ICE will likely make immigrant families, including citizen children in those families, more reluctant to access health coverage and care as well as other programs and services. The policy exacerbates already heightened fears among immigrant families due to increased immigration enforcement activity overall as well as other restrictive immigration policies, including changes in public charge policy and the recission of protections from immigration enforcement in sensitive locations such as health care facilities. Prior to the CMS notice of plans to share data, the KFF/New York Times 2025 Survey of Immigrants found that about half (51%) of immigrant adults were “very concerned” or “somewhat concerned” that health officials or health care providers may share their information with ICE or CBP (Figure 1). These fears may contribute to individuals delaying or avoiding medical care. About one in seven (14%) immigrant adults, including 48% who are likely undocumented and 20% who are parents, say that they or a family member have avoided seeking medical care since January 2025 due to immigration-related concerns.",https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2026/01/Potential-Implications-of-the-New-Medicaid-Data-Sharing-Agreement-Between-CMS-and-ICE_FI.png,N,,2026-01-14 22:57:29.753159

Illinois is locked in a series of legal battles with the Trump administration, challenging everything from federal funding freezes to what the state calls aggressive and unconstitutional immigration enforcement tactics.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined “Chicago Tonight” to discuss how the legal efforts are going amid a tense relationship between the state and federal governments.

On the lawsuit over immigration enforcement:

Illinois and Chicago officials are suing the Trump administration over what they describe as “menacing, violent and unlawful” immigration enforcement actions.

Notable violent encounters with federal immigration agents include the fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, in suburban Franklin Park in September. In October, Marimar Martinez was shot five times after following agents by car.

Minnesota filed its own, separate lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement on similar grounds following the fatal shooting of poet and mother Renee Good earlier this month.

“It’s important to note that our lawsuit is not saying that immigration enforcement should not happen. Of course it should happen,” Raoul said. “There are what are called enforcement and removal officers who have traditionally done that work on the interior and they are trained to do so. It’s targeted enforcement with warrants -— with not being violative of people’s privacy — not just doing sweeps and asking everybody whether or not they are a citizen of the United States.”

On the Supremacy Clause:

There are concerns that Illinois’ lawsuit may clash with the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which maintains that federal law supersedes state law. However, both Illinois and Minnesota’s suits argue that the federal government’s aggressive tactics are trying to force the states to abandon their sanctuary policies that protect immigrant communities, and that those tactics violate the Constitution’s 10th Amendment.

The 10th Amendment states “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”

“It was Justice Scalia that said in a case, U.S. v. Prince, that the federal government cannot commandeer states and state and local resources to do what is the federal government’s work,” Raoul said. “The 10th Amendment gives us our sovereignty, gives us a state’s rights. It used to be that Republicans would advocate for the protection of state rights.”

U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “It really is astounding that the Left can miraculously rediscover the Tenth Amendment when they don’t want federal law enforcement officers to enforce federal law — which is a clear federal responsibility under Article I, Article II and the Supremacy Clause — and then go right back to federalizing every state responsibility possible when they get back in power. Spare us.”

On sanctuary laws and the Constitution:

The legal battle intersects with Illinois’ Trust Act, which limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. Raoul said Illinois’ policies are consistent with the U.S. Constitution.

A recent report from Raoul’s office found that four Illinois sheriff’s offices complied with immigration detainers or civil immigration warrants, defying the state’s sanctuary laws.

“They’re self-reporting to us,” Raoul said. “We communicate back once they alert us that there may have been a violation as to how to avoid it happening again. These are situations where we’ve been alerted and we try to work with our law enforcement partners into making sure they’re abiding by the state law.”

On the federal government freezing funding to social safety net programs:

Last week, a federal judge granted a temporary, two-week restraining order blocking the Trump administration from freezing roughly $10 billion in federal funding for child care and family services programs in Illinois, California, Colorado, Minnesota and New York. The order prevents the funding from being withheld while the case moves forward.

As justification for freezing the funds, the Trump administration cited concerns about fraud and undocumented immigrants receiving benefits and said it needed to conduct internal reviews and collect documentation.

“It’s violative of … the Administrative Procedures Act in that it’s arbitrary in how they’re doing it, but it’s also political retribution,” Raoul said. “It’s just five states. It’s a fishing expedition.”

He continued: “We have systems in place to make sure that people who are receiving these benefits are people who sorely need these benefits, truly need them and truly qualify for them. Could there be a case here or there where somebody scams the system? Absolutely. We actually partner with the federal government in investigating and sometimes prosecuting such fraud.”

On ongoing legal battles:

Illinois is currently involved in dozens of lawsuits against the federal government — a number Raoul said could grow.

“It’s looking that way, and it’s not because I’m looking for battles with the Trump administration, but it’s because our Constitution and our laws are being violated,” Raoul said.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:25.371245

A proposed policy affirms IPS will protect student confidentiality and provide access to education for all children

This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for their newsletters at ckbe.at/newsletters.

Indianapolis Public Schools has rescinded resolutions signaling support for undocumented students following a lawsuit from state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

Instead, a new proposed policy on student access, safety, and privacy says the district will continue to protect the confidentiality of student records and information while providing “equal access to public education” for all students who live within the district — regardless of immigration status.

The proposal comes in the wake of a November lawsuit from Rokita’s office that claims the district impeded federal immigration enforcement. Rokita alleged that IPS policies hindered the deportation of a “Honduran national” who opted to voluntarily leave the country with his son, an IPS student.

Attorneys for IPS have said in court that the district would adopt a new policy that would render the state’s lawsuit moot. The board is expected to vote on the policy proposal at its meeting in February, according to board president Angelia Moore.

The updates could ultimately change little in how the district serves and protects undocumented students, whose rights to education and privacy are already protected by a string of state and federal laws and a U.S. Supreme Court case. The lawsuit, however, claims the district policy violates a state law that prohibits government entities from restricting immigration enforcement.

Neither IPS nor Rokita’s office immediately responded to a request for comment. School board president Angelia Moore declined to comment on the proposed policy, citing the ongoing litigation.

New resolution maintains IPS support for all students

At a retreat on Saturday, Jan. 10, 2026, the IPS school board rescinded two prior resolutions supporting undocumented students. One was adopted early in President Donald Trump’s first term, and the other was adopted early in his second term, amid high-profile and controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

One 2017 resolution stated the district’s support for creating a safe place for all students regardless of immigration status. It directed employees not to assist immigration enforcement efforts “unless legally required and authorized to do so by the Superintendent.”

Another 2025 resolution reaffirmed this commitment to all students.

But the resolution to rescind these prior commitments still maintains that the district supports all students and employees. It also references a variety of state and federal laws to protect immigrant families, including the federal Families and Educational Rights Privacy Act, known as FERPA, which restricts the ability of schools to provide student information to outside parties.

The resolution also references the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable search and seizure. Legal experts say Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can only enter school grounds under certain circumstances.

And the resolution references the 1982 Supreme Court ruling in Plyler v. Doe that undocumented students have a right to public education.

The proposed IPS policy states that IPS will operate within the legal framework provided by the United States Constitution, the state constitution, federal and state civil rights laws, federal education privacy laws, and Indiana statutes on public education.

The superintendent will adopt training and protocols for staff regarding student privacy and requests from outside agencies seeking information or access to students, the proposed policy states.

Rokita’s ICE lawsuit hinges on deportation flight

Rokita’s lawsuit alleges that an IPS student, the son of a Honduran national, went to school on the morning of his father’s scheduled deportation flight. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement later contacted IPS to “help the father take custody of his son,” the lawsuit claims.

The district said it would not release the child to an ICE officer without a judicial warrant or court order, the lawsuit states.

“ICE responded that it simply was asking that the son be released to the father so that they could depart the country as he had agreed to do and that such action did not require a court order,” the lawsuit states.

Rokita’s lawsuit targeted several district policies, including the 2017 resolution.

His office has previously argued that FERPA does permit the disclosure of some information, such as directory information, that could be related to a student’s immigration status. He has also argued that school officials could still give consent for law enforcement to enter school grounds without violating the Fourth Amendment.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/presto/2023/01/20/PIND/de6fa688-203b-4548-9b72-d2662b0acc23-IPSSchoolBoardMeeting_01192022_GH006.jpg?crop=7928,4460,x166,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 03:59:29.438696

The pause will begin Jan. 21 and will continue indefinitely until the department conducts a reassessment of immigrant visa processing.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT MINNESOTA’S ‘FEEDING OUR FUTURE’ FRAUD AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP’S LATEST CRACKDOWN

Somalia has drawn heightened scrutiny from federal officials following a sweeping fraud scandal centered in Minnesota, where prosecutors uncovered massive abuse of taxpayer-funded benefit programs. Many of those involved are Somali nationals or Somali-Americans.

In November 2025, a State Department cable sent to posts around the globe instructed consular officers to enforce sweeping new screening rules under the so-called ""public charge"" provision of immigration law.

The guidance instructs consular officers to deny visas to applicants deemed likely to rely on public benefits, weighing a wide range of factors including health, age, English proficiency, finances and even potential need for long-term medical care.

Older or overweight applicants could be denied, along with those who had any past use of government cash assistance or institutionalization.

""The State Department will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people,"" State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement.

""Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.""

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION REVOKES MORE THAN 100,000 VISAS IN FIRST YEAR BACK

While the public charge provision has existed for decades, enforcement has varied widely across administrations, with consular officers historically given broad discretion in applying the standard.

Exceptions to the new pause will be ""very limited"" and only allowed after an applicant has cleared public charge considerations.

A 2022 version of the public charge rule under the Biden administration had limited the scope of benefits considered — primarily to cash assistance and long-term institutional care — excluding programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the federal supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children, known as WIC, Medicaid or housing vouchers.

The Immigration and Nationality Act has long permitted consular officers to deem applicants inadmissible on public charge grounds, but President Donald Trump in 2019 expanded the definition to include a broader range of public benefits. That expansion was challenged in court, with portions ultimately blocked before being rescinded by the Biden administration.

Philadelphia elected officials are doubling down on last week’s rhetoric against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who violate the law

District Attorney Larry Krasner joined Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal and some city council members in speaking out against the potential for mass ICE raids in the city during a news conference at Salt and Light Church in the city’s Kingsessing neighborhood.

Krasner said ICE agents who break the law in Philadelphia will be arrested.

“We will arrest you. We will put handcuffs on you. We will close those cuffs. We will put you in a cell,” he said. “We will do everything in our power to convict you and we will make sure you serve your entire sentence because Donald Trump has no power whatsoever to pardon you.”

Krasner also defended Bilal, who got national attention last week when she said she would “bring the smoke” against ICE. She doubled down on that statement today.

She said that when someone commits a crime “in the city and the DA charges you, you will be arrested and you will go to jail. That’s the smoke.”

Councilmember Rue Landau said ICE raids can have a chilling effect that will prevent those without documentation from coming forward to testify in criminal cases, especially in cases such as domestic violence where the perpetrator could go free because of a lack of eyewitness testimony.

“If folks are scared to go to court, if they are scared the second they step out of their house to even get to that court hearing, they are in jeopardy,” Landau said. “If going to the hearing and walking outside puts them in harm’s way of ICE agents who are going to jump out of unmarked cars with unmarked vests and not showing their badges, they are going to jump on them, attack them and drag them away. They’re not going to participate in the process.”

Councilmember Jamie Gauthier, who is the daughter of immigrants, said her concerns with the ICE raids are not only focused on those without documentation.

President Donald Trump’s “secret police executed Renee Good, a mother, an American citizen, in broad daylight,” she said. “We see Trump’s actions for what they really are, a violent attempt to seize power and scare those who disagree with him.”

Gauthier pointed to next week’s commemoration of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and urged those in attendance to implement his nonviolent method of protesting to send a message to Washington, D.C.

“What he would want from our city, I think we all know that he was calling us to fiercely fight for our immigrant neighbors, not remain silent in the face of injustice,” she said.

It’s the second week in a row that a group of Philadelphia’s elected leaders gathered to decry activities related to federal immigration agents.

Last Thursday, Bilal drew national headlines for her criticism of ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who fatally shot Good in Minneapolis. Bilal denounced ICE agents for wearing masks and called them “fake law enforcement.”

Krasner dismissed the argument that the ICE officer fired his weapon in self-defense and repeated his pledge to prosecute any federal officers who commit crimes in Philadelphia. “We will charge any ICE agent who tries this nonsense here,” Krasner said last week.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel put out a statement Friday saying the police department was flooded with calls from around the country in response to those comments. Bethel’s statement clarified that Bilal’s office is a separate entity from the police department and does not police the city or conduct criminal investigations.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/larry-krasner-kp-011426-02.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:57:26.436062

A fight over funding ICE, which is a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, could trigger a partial government shutdown if lawmakers don't reach a deal by the end of the month.

Many law enforcement academies teach some of these skills, as well as basic CPR, during the first week.
Maybe ICE personnel are the rare law enforcement officers who do not regularly go through this sort of training.","Since last Wednesday, both the general populace and policymakers have debated whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Officer Jonathan Ross, who allegedly shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, properly applied the Department of Homeland Security’s deadly force policy. In the aftermath of the shooting, protests broke out not just in Minneapolis, where it occurred, but throughout the nation; those marching aver overly aggressive law enforcement officers outright murdered Good. Conversely, Vice President J.D. Vance alleged that Good was “part of a broader left-wing network to attack, to dox, to assault and to make it impossible for our ICE officers to do their job” and that she used the techniques of domestic terrorism to target federal officials; Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem vowed to send hundreds more of her employees to Minnesota to support her department’s ongoing operations there in the face of local resistance. Little agreement exists between the political poles on how to describe that fatal moment.

Whether Ross violated Homeland Security’s deadly force policies—and thus also potentially Good’s Fourth Amendment rights—is certainly one of the most important questions to arise out of her death. But amid the high passion and tumult of the debate, other, equally pressing issues remain largely unaddressed: Namely, what do the events which occurred immediately before Ross took the slack out of his trigger, and the response of him and his colleagues right after the final press, tell us about how ICE is conducting itself as it executes the largest apprehension and deportation operation in the history of the United States?

The answers are not comforting; they will provide little balm to anyone concerned with civil liberties, the lives of civilians, or the application of safe and proven law enforcement techniques (by which I mean ones that protect officers themselves from both adversarial danger and legal liability). Based on what has been publicly released, the whole interaction between Good, Ross, and the other ICE officials was a series of unforced errors by the government. The entire encounter, even accounting for Ross’s own footage, illustrates the general lack of professionalism with which ICE has operated over the past few months and its abandonment of its own internal policies.

This article will not wade into the debate over whether deadly force was justified at the exact moment Ross fired into the vehicle (that debate will largely focus on a narrow legal question—did he have a reasonable belief that Good would use her car as a weapon to hit him—in a manner that will frustrate many observers, and should rely on a much larger tranche of evidence than many observers realize). Because even if Ross’s deadly force was justified in the moment he fired his weapon, what much of the nation has now seen was not professionalized or situationally appropriate law enforcement. It was a series of incredibly bad choices leading to an unnecessary death. At every step which led to the fatal trigger press, ICE could have behaved differently. It could have behaved more tactically. It could have behaved more humanely. The nation—to say nothing of Renee Nicole Good’s family—deserves an honest accounting of why it did not.

* * *

Why was ICE interacting with Good in the first place?

The question isn’t rhetorical. Video footage shows that she was clearly—at least for a few moments, if not longer—blocking traffic by positioning her car in the middle of the road; furthermore, she was doing so while in the presence of law enforcement vehicles with lights and sirens activated. Such behavior would appear to be a prima facie violation of Minnesota Statute 169.20 §5, a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine, and perhaps diversion to a remedial driving school. If a peace officer with the appropriate authority ordered her to move, and she chose not to comply, she also may have been violating Minnesota Statute 169.34 §1(11).

But much of the analysis actually hinges on the phrase “peace officer.” Not all law enforcement agencies are authorized to enforce all statutes; generally speaking, state and local departments enforce state and local laws, while federal officers and agents enforce federal laws and constitutional violations. States can provide exceptions to this general rule by enacting an enabling law granting federal officials the authority to enforce state laws, which confers peace officer status.

Minnesota defines a peace officer as “an employee of a political subdivision [i.e. a local municipality] or state law enforcement agency,” and only grants their federal counterparts arrest authorities for the purposes of state and local violations when a number of conditions are met. The most important of these prerequisites requires that the federal officer be on duty, acting at the request of a local or state officer, and operating pursuant to the supervision of that local or state officer. At this point, neither ICE management nor any executive branch officials have argued that these conditions were met; indeed, the tenor and tone of statements by the Minneapolis mayor and Minnesota governor would certainly suggest otherwise. The proper remedy, then, for Good’s obstruction of traffic would have simply been for the ICE officers to request that local police join in the response and facilitate the movement of her vehicle.

But let’s put this argument aside, for the moment.

Even if ICE had no authority to enforce state traffic regulations, it may argue that Good was violating 18 U.S.C. §111, which prohibits “assaulting, resisting, or impeding” federal law enforcement officials. But as the Justice Department itself maintains, that statute requires an element of force on the part of the offender, and also requires that the officer be engaged in the performance of official duties. With respect to the first part, it is difficult to see, in any of the videos released thus far, any moment at which Good deployed force against the officers. What she and others appear to have been doing is videotaping them, verbally sparring with them, and perhaps blowing whistles. But every federal appellate court which has addressed the issue recognizes a First Amendment right to film the police, regardless of whether one is a bystander or the actual criminal subject; ICE’s behavior with regard to this sort of activity in other jurisdictions, which is becoming increasingly frequent, clearly violates the Constitution. Even Ross’s own footage does not appear to demonstrate any behavior by Good at the outset of the interaction which violates a federal criminal law or would not be shielded by First Amendment protections.

But let’s put this argument aside for the moment as well.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, and the question still remains whether they acted in a manner that comports with their own internal policies. The agency’s Employee Code of Conduct §5.4 mandates that “ICE employees must be professional, polite, respectful, and patient in all official activities that involve contact with…members of the public, even in the face of considerable provocation.” It is difficult to understand how yelling at a woman to “get out of the fucking car” when she is not acting violent, or calling her a “fucking bitch,” after shooting at her three times, would comport with this rule. ICE’s own disciplinary guidance mandates suspensions for “using rude, impolite, discourteous, unprofessional, obscene…or similarly inappropriate language, gestures, or conduct…to members of the public.” Making improper comments during operations is similarly prohibited and punishable under the guidance. It might be a small violation, not particularly important for the larger issues at play here, but it is a data point, nonetheless.

But let’s put aside this argument, too, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law and operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines. The question still remains whether they appropriately de-escalated the situation before resorting to force. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons himself recently noted, in an Associated Press feature, that “[i]n any type of law enforcement situation you’d rather de-escalate with words before you have to use any use of force.” The agency’s head firearms instructor promised that “[w]e do our very best to make sure that even though they’re in that [dangerous] environment, that they have the wherewithal to make the proper decision. Nobody wants to be the one to make a bad shot…” But none of the footage thus far released, by bystanders or the agency, reveals any moment in which any of the officers tried to defuse the situation without violence. Ross spent an inordinate amount of time videotaping his interaction with Good on his cellphone, and at no point in his own recording does he attempt to calm the situation or even betray any sense of his own self-possession. The officers who come to assist him do not interact with Good at all, except to run towards her vehicle while shouting “Get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car,” before trying to forcibly open her door.

But let’s also put this argument aside, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines, and had attempted to de-escalate the situation. The question still remains whether they needed to immediately approach Good’s vehicle. Other standard law enforcement techniques exist to remove someone from an automobile that will less likely lead to a violent outcome, and are actually safer for the involved officers. The intersection near which Good was parked—East 34th Street and Portland Avenue—lay on a standard city grid. A plethora of law enforcement vehicles were in the immediate vicinity, some of which could have redeployed in less than a minute to block Good’s means of egress. ICE could have established a “surround and call out,” wherein they isolated and contained Good, stayed themselves in a position of safe cover, and, if necessary and justified, had drawn and aimed their weapons as a prophylactic measure. After establishing a perimeter, they could have utilized their vehicles’ microphones and loudspeakers to issue instructions for Good to exit her vehicle in a manner that ensured everyone’s safety.

To be clear, while this would not be a common technique to use for someone who was not the identified subject of a warrant or acting violent, it was an available option if ICE seriously thought removing Good from her car, for some reason, was absolutely necessary.

But let’s put this argument aside as well, for the moment.

Assume, just as a thought experiment, that ICE was properly enforcing either state traffic regulations or federal law, operating pursuant to its own professional guidelines, had attempted to de-escalate the situation, and that a surround and call out had not successfully extricated Good from her vehicle. The question still remains whether ICE approached her automobile in a tactically sound manner. Video footage indicates that the first movement occurs when Ross maneuvers himself from the side of Good’s vehicle to its front, all the while videotaping his actions with his cellphone in what appears to be his dominant hand (he switches the device to his other side when it comes time for him to draw his weapon). This change in position defies both standard practice and common sense: As the former chief of the FBI’s Tactical Training Unit noted to The New York Times, “Obviously just from a safety standpoint, officers are taught to approach vehicles from angles that would not put themselves squarely in the traffic path if at all possible.” If Ross thought himself in danger, it also defies explanation why he occupied his best hand with his phone, solely to capture video footage.

The other officers, who quickly join Ross, similarly eschew standard law enforcement techniques. Generally speaking, most agencies train personnel to approach a vehicle deliberately when there is an unknown risk combined with no imminent threat; all the officers here sprinted toward Good’s automobile. A car contains a number of potentially dangerous areas that officers need to observe before any substantive interactions with the occupants: the trunk or rear cabin; the back passenger side, which gives a view as to whether anyone is ensconced in the back seat or on the floor of the vehicle; and, the front driver’s side, which allows the approaching officer to see who is sitting in the front of the car while simultaneously keeping an eye on the hands of the driver. Officers generally should approach these positions cautiously and with enough distance to look through the windows before making any further tactical decisions. (Although I’m referring to deliberate movement and observations, these words do not mean that the personnel should move tentatively or without alacrity, but simply that their actions should rely more on forethought and training than adrenaline and emotion.) In this case, the officers other than Ross both proceed immediately to the driver’s door. Only one maintains a distance and position that would not entangle him with the vehicle should it begin moving.

At this point, we have run out of arguments which we can momentarily cabin. As videos of the incident show, as Renee Nicole Good turns her steering wheel to the right and begins to drive away, three shots ring out, her vehicle careens into a parked car and light post, and the assembled bystanders scream.

* * *

The crack of the shots dissipates into the air, the car sits crumpled and smoking, and then something does not happen. None of the ICE officers appear to be in any hurry to go render aid to Good; they do not approach the crash site tactically, nor do they rush towards it. The only reaction any of the officers seem to have is when Ross appears to exclaim that Good was a “fucking bitch.” ICE personnel actually prevented civilian medics on the scene from rendering any aid.

The withholding of aid alone could have serious consequences for the involved officers if they ever find themselves facing a color of law civil rights investigation, as it speaks to a deliberate indifference to a serious medical condition as prohibited by the relevant statute. The notion that law enforcement personnel would rush to provide medical assistance to someone they have just shot seems counterintuitive to those who have never worn a badge, but in the years following the death of George Floyd, the federal government overhauled its guidelines to mandate this very behavior. The Department of Homeland Security’s deadly force policy specifically requires the following:

As soon as practicable following a use of force and the end of any perceived public safety threat, DHS LEOs shall obtain appropriate medical assistance for any subject who has visible or apparent injuries, complains of being injured, or requests medical attention. This may include rendering first aid if properly trained and equipped to do so, requesting emergency medical services, and/or arranging transportation to an appropriate medical facility.

Federal law enforcement officers and agents generally receive fairly extensive medical training throughout their careers, particularly with respect to gunshot wounds; a standard part of their issued tactical gear, carried on their ballistic vests, is the basic equipment necessary to staunch the attendant bleeding, such as tourniquets, Israeli bandages, and occlusive dressings. Many personnel—certainly those certified as tactical medics—can perform a field tracheotomy and, if needed, intubate someone with an endotracheal tube. Many law enforcement academies teach some of these skills, as well as basic CPR, during the first week. Officers refine their training throughout their careers, and most have a refresher of the basics during the active shooter training which are now a regular part of the job[1] [2] . It is possible that not a single ICE officer on the scene ever received any of this instruction, or that none of them had any medical equipment on hand. But it is also unlikely.

Maybe ICE personnel are the rare law enforcement officers who do not regularly go through this sort of training. But perhaps, then, their leaders should reconsider whether the agency is best suited to be the tip of the spear in operations to apprehend “the worst of the worst.”

After a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renée Good in Minneapolis last Wednesday, Trump administration officials were quick to come out in the agent’s defense.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Jonathan Ross—a veteran officer with ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations arm who has been identified by multiple media reports as the shooter—followed his training and the agency’s protocol. Vice President JD Vance claimed Ross had reason to fear for his life and acted in self-defense. And press secretary Karoline Leavitt referred to Good as a “deranged lunatic woman” who tried to run over the office with her vehicle as a weapon. Officials repeatedly accused Good of perpetrating “domestic terrorism.”

The narrative put forward by the administration is largely disproved by available video evidence. And it has even been received with skepticism by some former ICE employees, who are condemning Ross’ use of force against the 37-year-old mother of three and warning that their one-time agency has lost its way.

Former ICE chief of staff Jason Hauser recently wrote in USA Today: “When enforcement is driven by messaging instead of mission, when optics outweigh judgment and when leadership substitutes spectacle for strategy, the risk to officers, civilian and public safety increases exponentially.”

The second Trump presidency has taken ICE off the leash. The agency is now the highest-funded law enforcement body in the United States, with a budget that eclipses that of some countries’ militaries. With its near-unlimited resources and aggressive directions from the White House, ICE is sending federal immigration agents not trained in community policing to make at-large arrests in cities across the country. (Days after the shooting, Noem announced DHS would deploy hundreds more agents to Minneapolis.)

Two ex-ICE workers I spoke with described an agency that, in pursuit of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation mandate, is engaging in reckless and risky behavior.

“They’re essentially operating now in a resource constraint-free environment and doing very dangerous things,” said Scott Shuchart, who previously worked at the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties within DHS and more recently as ICE’s assistant director for regulatory affairs and policy under the Biden administration. Violent interactions with the public aren’t surprising, he added. “That’s sort of by design.”

Dan Gividen, an immigration lawyer who acted as deputy chief counsel for ICE’s Dallas field office between 2016 and 2019, compared what the agency is doing as akin to running into a crowded movie theater and yelling “fire.” “You’ve got these ICE officers that are pouring out of these vehicles, pointing guns at US citizens—people who’ve done absolutely nothing wrong—and causing chaos.”

ICE removal agents charged with doing administrative arrests, he said, lack the tactical training to safely do operations out in communities. “It’s not at all surprising that this is happening with these ICE ERO officers being sent out to basically treat people terribly,” he said, anticipating more escalation of violence.

Another former ICE trial attorney I spoke with said that, typically, removal officers weren’t trained in high-risk operations because the daily demands of the job didn’t require it. In the past, if such an encounter took place, local law enforcement might have gotten involved to help keep the situation under control. “What has changed is there has been an encouragement from the top to be much more aggressive in enforcement and ramp things up and get the job done,” the ex-counsel for the agency told me.

In Gividen’s view, the federal immigration agents didn’t have a reason to interact with Good to begin with. “He had no reason to believe she had committed any offense that he actually has the authority to investigate,” Gividen said of Ross. “They murdered her, plain and simple. That is all there is to it. The notion that they were in any way, shape, or form acting in self-defense to put three bullets in that woman is absolutely absurd.”

An ICE’s use of force and firearms policy directive from 2023 states that authorized officers should only use force when “no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative” is available. It also mandates that the level of force be “objectively reasonable” given the circumstances and instructs officers to “de-escalate” the situation. The guidelines further state that an agent who uses deadly force should be placed on administrative leave for three consecutive days. (ICE didn’t respond to questions from Mother Jones about its policies and whether Ross had been put on leave.)

“The question isn’t: Was he in any danger?” Shuchart said. “The question is: Was the use of force the only thing he could do to address the danger? And was the use of immediate deadly force the appropriate level of force?”

One of the videos shows that Ross appeared to move out of the way to avoid possible contact with the car. “I don’t understand how you get from there to the idea that deadly stop and force against the driver was necessary to protect the officer from serious bodily harm,” added Shuchart, who until January 2025 was part of a team that handles ICE-wide policy and regulations.

A DHS-wide 2023 policy on use of force generally prohibits deadly force “solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing subject” and the discharging of firearms to “disable moving vehicles.” But a recent Wall Street Journal investigation identified at least 13 instances since July where immigration agents fired at or into civilian cars, shooting eight people—including five US citizens—and leaving two dead.

Instead of de-escalating, Shuchart said, Ross only “exacerbated the danger.” Shuchart pointed to a number of errors Ross made that could have been avoided, starting with his decision to step in front of the car. “This officer was not just freshly coming across the scene when a vehicle lurches at him,” he said. “[He] had already violated policy creating a danger to himself by crossing in front of the vehicle that wasn’t in park. You have to assess what was reasonable in those circumstances from the fact that he had created the potential danger to himself.”

Prior to joining ERO, Ross did a stint with the Indiana National Guard in Iraq and worked as a field intelligence agent for the Border Patrol. His job as an ICE deportation officer in the Twin Cities area involved arresting “higher-value targets,” according to his own testimony from court records obtained by Wired, related to an accident last June when Ross was dragged by a car during an arrest.

“As a matter of what someone in law enforcement anywhere would be trained to do, and what someone would be trained to do under DHS policy, what he was doing was nuts,” Shuchart said of Ross’ actions last week. “He was so completely out of line with respect to what would have been safe for him and the other people on that operation. It was not at all how any kind of operation should go.”

According to Shuchart, the agents at the scene also failed to follow protocol in the aftermath of the shooting by appearing to not immediately render medical assistance or confirm that, if the target was in fact a threat, they no longer presented danger.

Speaking to the New York Times, Trump appeared to try to justify Good’s killing by saying she had been “very, very disrespectful” to law enforcement.

“The fact that their feelings are hurt by US citizens disapproving of what they do loudly is completely irrelevant,” Shuchart said. “The point of the job is not to have your feelings well-cared for by the public.”

Under pressure to meet the administration’s goal of 3,000 daily arrests, ICE has been on a hiring spree. The agency is offering candidates signing bonuses and plans a $100 million “wartime recruitment” effort that includes geo-targeted ads and influencers targeting gun rights supporters and UFC fights attendees to bring in as many as 10,000 new hires. Earlier this month, DHS publicized the addition of 12,000 officers and agents—from a pool of 220,000 “patriotic” applicants who responded to the government’s “Defend the Homeland” calls—more than doubling ICE’s workforce.

So far, the result of that expansion drive has been less than optimal, with recruits failing fitness tests and not undergoing proper vetting. Experts have also raised concerns about the lowering of standards and reduced training times for new hires as the administration pushes to get more agents in the streets and rack up arrest numbers quickly.

“I would be skeptical of anyone who would take a job with an agency that is willing to defend behavior this unprofessional,” Shuchart said. “There are thousands of law enforcement agencies in this country. If you’re a decent recruit, go work for one of the others that has more reasonable standards and expectations.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260113_trump-ice-design_2000_v2b.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:08.333630

Since January 2025, Austin officers have reported people with administrative warrants to ICE dozens of times.

APD Chief Lisa Davis told The Texas Newsroom that she will create new department “general orders” that will explicitly state that local police can cooperate more fully with federal immigration officers in the execution of immigration warrants. She said the change reflects the fact that state law gives officers greater discretion in contacting ICE than is outlined in the department’s current policy.

“Officers may but are not required to call ICE,” Davis told The Texas Newsroom in an interview on Tuesday.

In a follow up email ahead of publication, APD spokesperson Anna Sabana said, “Chief Davis said the rule change comes after city legal advised her that current general orders should address administrative warrants and ensure mandates of [Senate Bill 4] are adhered to.”

The move comes after immigration advocates and legal experts raised questions about APD’s decision to turn over a Honduran mother and her young daughter to ICE earlier this month.

APD officers called U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after encountering the woman during a disturbance call. In a statement, Davis initially said APD was required to notify ICE because the woman had an ICE “administrative warrant.” In fact, Austin police officers have reported dozens of people with similar warrants to ICE since President Donald Trump started his second term, city records show.

Legal experts questioned whether this cooperation was required, noting the department’s policy only required contact with ICE for people who federal authorities have formally requested they detain.

But Davis said the department’s policy has been out of step with state law and needs updating. She said local police will now be able to freely contact ICE and may even ask for the immigration status of people they encounter, a notable departure from current policy that has discouraged prioritizing immigration enforcement.

“I have no doubt that officers have been confused on this,” she said. Adding that the new general order “is going to help with that confusion.”

Late Wednesday, multiple members of the Austin City Council said they do not anticipate more cooperation between APD and ICE under the new department policy. .

Councilmember José “Chito” Vela said his understanding was that individual APD officers will not be freely calling ICE because they would need to run their decisions by a commanding officer. He hopes that under the new policy, which he pointed out has not been finalized, notifications to ICE would only happen rarely, as when the person involved also was guilty of certain violent criminal offenses.

“We have to be very careful in our decisions when to call ICE about the administrative warrants.” he said “Because of [state law], we cannot adopt a blanket policy of ‘we can’t call ICE,’ so we have to be very judicious about the policy that we do adopt and make sure it’s an exceptional circumstance.”

The City of Austin did not respond to a request for comment from The Texas Newsroom, but Vela provided a memo dated January 14 from the city’s legal team that he anticipates will shape the final policy.

He said he expects the new APD policy to be finalized soon.

While ICE actions in Austin have remained relatively low profile, the move comes as immigration enforcement has become a part of daily life in some US cities, prompting nationwide protests.

APD reported dozens of people to ICE

APD’s current policy, General Order 318.3.4, only explicitly mandates officers alert ICE when a so-called “ICE detainer” or request to hold a person is issued.

A detainer is a formal request from federal authorities to hold someone in police custody for a suspected immigration violation. Administrative warrants, by contrast, are routinely issued by federal agents to flag someone who may have violated civil immigration law.

Administrative warrants and detainers “are different things in federal immigration law,” Elissa Steglich, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin, told The Texas Newsroom. She said as far as she can tell, “there is room for Austin to not notify ICE” regarding warrants.

But lawyers working for the city disagreed, according to Davis.

She said they advised her recently that APD cannot stop officers from contacting ICE when they uncover administrative warrants under state laws. Those laws require local police to cooperate with federal law enforcement and allow local officers to detain people they suspect of being undocumented. Some of these provisions are being challenged in court.

“Senate Bill 4 does not allow us to tell officers they cannot call ICE on these things,” Davis told The Texas Newsroom.

Davis said she was unaware that department policy needed to be updated until after the incident with the Honduran mother and her child this month. Advocates with Grassroots Leadership said the pair was deported, despite them saying the daughter is a U.S. citizen, after APD reported them to ICE.

The Texas Newsroom was unable to independently confirm this information.

Davis said ICE notified APD of the uptick in administrative warrants in early 2025, when immigration authorities flooded a federal police database with 14,000 warrants under the second Trump administration.

Some officers began reporting people with these warrants to ICE but APD policy was never updated to reflect their ability to do so, Davis added.

Since January 2025, Austin officers have reported people with administrative warrants to ICE dozens of times. The City of Austin requires APD to file quarterly reports detailing police interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement over someone’s immigration status. An analysis of these reports shows that APD contacted ICE 33 times from January through September of last year.

Data for the fourth quarter of last year has yet to be released.

Some of the people reported to ICE were reaching out to police for help. In one instance, a man contacted EMS “to speak with a doctor about his mental health.” EMS contacted APD, which found that the person was the subject of what the report calls an “ICE warrant.”

“Officers contacted ICE,” the report described, “but no federal officials were available.”

In this case, EMS voluntarily took the caller to the hospital. It’s unclear whether immigration agents contacted that person after he was discharged.

In total, around 13 of the individuals who were determined to have ICE warrants were not taken into custody.

In eight instances, the people were booked into the Travis County jail, from which ICE routinely takes people into its custody. Four times, ICE arrived at the scene of an APD investigation to immediately take people into custody.

Davis said she was unaware local police were present during ICE apprehensions until this month.

The city reports also documented the race/ethnicity of the people reported to ICE: 26 were listed as Hispanic, eight as White and one as Middle Eastern. The reporting did not indicate if any of those people listed as White also identify as another ethnicity as well.

Advocates say that administrative warrants are commonly applied even to immigrants pursuing legal asylum claims. They worry that migrants who may have been flagged with a warrant without being aware may misunderstand their risk of deportation when interacting with local police.

“They may not be aware that [in] calling the police, or coming into contact with police, their information may be run and they will then have ICE called on them,” Sabina Hinz-Foley Trejo, an organizer with the group Grassroots Leadership, told The Texas Newsroom.

How APD policy on ICE will change

Davis said that she does not believe the new policy will contradict earlier statements she made that it is not APD’S job to enforce civil warrants.

Last year, she told The Texas Newsroom that officers lose community trust and their ability to fight crime when they become immigration enforcers. She said at the time, “We do not ask about immigration status here in Austin.”

She said the new general orders will specify a chain of communication that officers must observe when they decide to notify ICE that they have found someone with an administrative warrant. Under her proposal, officers will first notify a duty commander that they intend to contact immigration authorities.

“The officer may want to call ICE and may opt to do that [...] the decision to remain on scene will be with the commander,” Davis said. “The decision to wait would be on a commander.”

She said some details of the new policy are still awaiting input from city legal staff. But the city and police department may be releasing more information about the changes by the end of the week, according to an APD spokesperson.

The Texas Newsroom asked if the changes to policy mean Chief Davis may stop telling the public that APD officers do not ask about people’s immigration status. She replied, “you know what? I don't know how to answer that.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90995d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4583x2406+0+324/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5c%2Fd9%2Fea1fd16e4c32bbc8e24dfa6fc36d%2Faustin-police-department-49585644311-o.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:58:12.169662

The lawmakers called it “unconscionable” that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would consider building another migrant jail in New Jersey, even after an uprising and a detainee’s death at Delaney Hall, the Newark facility that opened last year. They urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons to “immediately cease” any plans for a jail in Roxbury.

Divided NJ Legislature gives final passage to three anti-ICE bills

“Immigration detention facilities in New Jersey have become notorious for inefficiency and waste in addition to humanitarian failure. These failures have inflicted trauma both on detained individuals and on surrounding families, communities and local governments who have been forced to grapple with the ongoing harms associated with immigrant detention,” they wrote in the three-page letter.

According to the Washington Post, internal ICE documents show the Trump administration is seeking contractors to turn industrial warehouses into jails to hold thousands of immigrant detainees. Roxbury is among two dozen locations across the country where officials are mulling warehouse jails.

“The proposal would subject thousands of people, the majority of whom pose no threat to public safety, to confinement under cruel and inhumane conditions. Warehouses are designed for storage and shipping, not for safely housing people,” the lawmakers’ letter reads.

They stressed that ICE detention facilities “already have a poor track record.” Thirty-two people died in ICE custody last year, making it one of the deadliest years in the agency’s history, according to groups like the American Civil Liberties Union that track in-custody deaths.

The Democrats noted in their letter that prior to Delaney Hall’s opening, they warned of the dangers of expanding immigrant detention and urged officials to reverse those plans. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement entered into a 15-year contract with prison company Geo Group to operate the 1,000-bed facility anyway, and the facility opened last spring.

Since then, Delaney Hall has been at the center of numerous controversies. Newark city officials alleged Geo Group opened it without securing the proper permits, prompting a lawsuit. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) was arrested there May 9 — he was charged with trespassing, and prosecutors quickly dismissed the case — and Rep. LaMonica McIver (D) was charged with assault in connection with the melee that occurred when agents moved to detain Baraka. In June, four detainees escaped after knocking down a shoddy wall, and in December, a detainee died less than a day after arriving at the jail.

The letter from Democrats comes on the heels of Roxbury’s all-GOP council unanimously passing an ordinance that says the town is “not an appropriate municipality” for a detainee processing facility. The ordinance says township officials have not been approached or solicited by the federal government about opening the facility there.

Hearing: Biden’s Afghan Parolee Program – A Trojan Horse with Flawed Vetting and Deadly Consequences

Date: January 14, 2026

Submitted by: Refugees International, Afghan American Foundation

Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee:

Between 1996 and 2001, Afghanistan was governed by the Taliban, then an unrecognized but highly centralized regime that imposed an extreme social order, ruling primarily through clerics and armed militias rather than civilian institutions. Under heavy international sanctions and with virtually no technocratic bureaucracy, the Taliban remained diplomatically isolated and incapable of delivering economic recovery nor a viable future for the Afghan people. Girls’ education was largely banned nationwide, women were barred from most work and severely restricted in their movement, and public life was stripped of music, television, and most sports. Punishments were carried out publicly and included beatings, amputations, and executions. At the same time, humanitarian conditions were catastrophic – millions faced chronic hunger amid drought and economic collapse, with widespread shortages of basic necessities such as food, water, and medicine. Regrettably, many of these conditions have resurfaced following the United States withdrawal in 2021.

For two decades, the United States pursued a political and development mission in Afghanistan at enormous cost in American lives and resources. Alongside combat operations, sustained investments in education, healthcare, and human rights produced measurable gains across the country. Afghanistan’s education system expanded dramatically, moving from a period in which girls’ public schooling had been effectively shut down to one in which, by 2020, roughly nine million students were enrolled—up to three and a half million of them girls. Literacy rates among children, including girls, rose substantially over the same period. Health outcomes also improved. The expansion of clinics and the training and deployment of female health workers enabled millions of women and girls to access essential care for the first time. Life expectancy increased, while infant mortality fell by nearly half. These development gains were closely intertwined with advances in human rights and public participation. Millions of Afghans—many of them women—entered civic and public life as teachers, doctors, journalists, civil society leaders, and elected officials. Independent media and civil society organizations expanded, and space opened, however imperfectly, for public debate, political participation, and accountability.

Many of these gains would not have been possible without the close partnership between American forces and Afghan allies, some of whom came to the United States and became valuable community members. For two decades, Afghans stood with the U.S. mission in the belief that it offered a path away from repression and extremism. Afghans supported and sacrificed alongside American service members and civilians so that their children could return to school, their wives and daughters could become doctors, engineers, journalists, and public servants, and their country could begin building institutions capable of sustaining a more just and stable democratic future. That shared project created not only progress in Afghanistan, but trust, personal relationships, and migration pathways to the United States for certain Afghans. Congress established the Special Immigrant Visa program in 2009 to provide a viable pathway to safety in the United States for Afghans who supported the U.S. mission, were subject to extensive vetting, and faced serious threats as a result of their service. Afghans who arrived in the United States in the 2010s, as SIVs or who sought asylum in fear of return to Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban, have become integrated members of our communities, establishing businesses, raising U.S. born-children, working as professionals and continuing to support the U.S. mission of advancing human rights in Afghanistan.

Following the United States withdrawal, interpreters, women leaders, journalists, and partners of U.S. organizations in Afghanistan were placed at acute risk of reprisal by the Taliban. Indeed, following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021, the remaining hope for many Afghan allies was the promise, explicit and implicit, that the U.S. would stand by those who stood with it. The U.S. prioritized evacuation and resettlement through the US Refugee Admissions Program of these individuals who met specific eligibility requirements and passed security and medical screenings. Afghans were also evacuated to U.S. military bases and paroled into the United States through Operation Allies Welcome. Although different policy choices could have been made regarding the operational execution and processing of Afghans on overseas bases and in the United States, the screening and vetting procedures were rigorous to protect our national security.

At the outset of Operations Allies Welcome, community-based organizations– such as two in Virginia, one founded by veterans, volunteers, and neighbors called NovaRaft and another founded by Afghan-Americans whose families had arrived as refugees in the 1980s and 1990s called Fresh Start Refugee Assistance–stepped in to resettle newly arrived Afghans. They secured apartments, enrolled children in school, provided English and IT classes, helped obtain drivers licenses, and connected people with jobs. Meanwhile, in Nebraska, Jason Malloy, a U.S. military veteran who had worked closely with Afghan interpreters, began volunteering with the Afghan-American community in Omaha. He helped newly paroled Afghan evacuees with airport pickups, transportation to medical and DMV appointments, and school enrollment for their children. He remains in touch with many of the families he supported and describes them as among the hardest-working and most grateful people he has known. For him, and for the many thousands of our veterans, supporting Afghan allies is not an act of charity, but a continuation of service and a fulfillment of the United States’ moral obligation to those who stood with it.

Even so, tens of thousands of Afghan allies were left behind, either hiding across Afghanistan or stranded in precarious conditions in neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan. Many Afghans fled in hopes of accessing parole, refugee or SIV pathways, but have since faced mistreatment, detention, and/or forcible return to the Taliban. The Trump administration has not only cut off access to refugee resettlement in the United States for Afghans abroad at risk of return to persecution, it has also stopped processing asylum applications by Afghans in the United States, begun detaining Afghan asylum seekers for deportation, and called for re-examination of resettled Afghan refugees. This betrays not only Afghan allies, but also the many Americans who generously welcomed them to communities across the country.

There are several stories of our Afghan allies now at risk, including from those below, using pseudonyms to protect their identity.

Hajera worked on a USAID-supported medical project that provided life-saving care to pregnant Afghan women. Massoud worked as an interpreter with U.S. military training programs for the Afghan National Army. Massoud, Hajera, and their three children were unable to board U.S. evacuation flights in August 2021. They remained in hiding in Kabul for several months and then moved to Mazar-e-Sharif, hoping it would be safer. They repeatedly sought evacuation options, but months passed without a viable pathway. Without any other option, they traveled first to Brazil, then to Mexico, and entered the United States through the CBP One process. They are now in the U.S. with a pending asylum case. Under the new policies, their case has been suspended.

Fatima was a police officer in Afghanistan. She escaped the Taliban with her elderly mother and sister. They made their way through the Darien Gap and eventually to Mexico, where for most of 2024 they waited for a CBP One appointment, first in Mexico City, and then, after being bussed southward by Mexican immigration authorities, in Villahermosa. Once they received their appointment, they flew to Tijuana, were screened and paroled for two years by CBP officers at the port of San Ysidro, joined their friends and relatives in Sacramento, and applied for asylum. Like all others who arrived via CBP One appointments, they received a notice sent en masse terminating their parole regardless of the specifics of their individual cases. Their immigration court hearing, which had been scheduled for a date in June, disappeared and has been listed as “pending” in the immigration court system ever since. Fatima wrote to Refugees International asking whether they would be detained when they go to their regular check-in with ICE.

These are just a few of the tens of thousands of Afghan allies who took extraordinary risks to support U.S. objectives and help rebuild their country. Fatima and Hajera are now at risk of being deported back to Afghanistan. This is unconscionable. It would return two women who supported U.S. objectives to a country where the state enforces gender apartheid through a tightening national system of bans and restrictions designed to remove women and girls from public life—blocking education, employment, movement without a male guardian, and participation in public spaces and civil society. For humanitarian actors, the result is an operating environment where women’s visibility and agency are treated as violations, and where the impact of donor withdrawal is magnified by deliberate repression. Across the country, the Trump administration is also arbitrarily detaining law-abiding Afghans who arrived in the United States more than a decade ago and have active asylum cases. These are parents, elderly, business owners, and community members, who are now deeply rooted in their neighborhoods, paid taxes, and call America home. These actions do not make our country safer. They are tearing families apart and punishing our Afghan allies using pretext that has no relationship to their cases nor respects their longstanding contributions.",https://d3jwam0i5codb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/RI_Social_Share.png,N,,2026-01-14 19:58:04.371362

The State Department, which oversees visa processing at U.S. embassies and consulates, said it would indefinitely pause the issuance of immigrant visas requested by citizens of 75 countries, halting legal immigration channels for roughly 38% of all nations in the world.

Officials said the pause would apply to immigrant visas, meaning those requested by people abroad who have been sponsored by American relatives or employers to move to the U.S. permanently. The suspension, officials said, does not affect temporary visas requested by would-be tourists and travelers seeking to come to the U.S. on a short-term basis.

The State Department said the 75 countries were chosen as part of an effort to bar the entry of immigrants who were likely to rely on public assistance once in the U.S. Officials said they would examine immigration procedures during the pause to better identify and bar would-be immigrants from those countries who were likely to become a ""public charge"" — or an economic burden — on the U.S.

""The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,"" the department said Wednesday. ""The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.""

The State Department did not formally publish a full list of the 75 affected nations, but said Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea are among them. A list first reported by Fox News, and confirmed by the State Department to CBS News, includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Guatemala, Pakistan and Senegal.

The pause on immigrant visas is set to take effect next week, on Jan. 21, according to a U.S. official and a congressional official briefed on the move.

Longstanding federal law bars immigrants from coming to the U.S. or getting lawful permanent residency if they are deemed to become a public charge. Historically, the restriction has been applied in limited cases, such as when immigrants would require long-term institutionalized care in the U.S.

But dating back to President Trump's first administration, his aides have sought to dramatically expand who can be considered ineligible to immigrate to the U.S. on public charge grounds.

While the Trump administration has launched a highly-visible crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S., it has simultaneously issued a series of policies to sharply restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/08/64149989-78e0-4137-b90a-0dea76b5b1f3/thumbnail/1200x630/f4dd7ba3861e69c37135a32b676b6423/IAD-US-Evacs2L-Apr2020.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:04.700457

Democrats now seem to be openly advocating for the disruption of this social contract − even calling to defund or abolish ICE altogether.","As I watch the firestorm continue to rage between Minnesota lawmakers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, I miss President Barack Obama (just a little bit).

Surprising, I know. Why?

Obama was the last Democrat who, despite my disagreements with many of his ideas and policies − especially Obamacare, which I view as a failure − often made sense, particularly on immigration. In two terms, Barack ""Deporter-In-Chief"" Obama deported over 3.1 million immigrants via ICE. In fiscal year 2012, over 407,000 people were removed. He was even publicly scolded for doing home raids and told to stop.

Though this was a bit controversial, Democrats didn't seem to mind much. Republicans did criticize Obama for favoring amnesty, but these actions were necessary to maintain law, order, and our social contract.

This is different from what the Democratic Party espouses today. Rather than looking at the meltdown in Minnesota as an example to avoid, the Democratic Party seems to be doing the opposite. Progressive Democrats in both chambers are urging their party to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security unless it includes restrictions tied to ICE. Some prominent Democrats are even calling to abolish ICE after last week's deadly event.

This would be a huge mistake, but one that I'd suggest Democrats go ahead and make, especially if it's truly reflective of their values and beliefs. This way, Americans can truly see that they have become a party purposely defying the very social contract that keeps America's fabric stitched together. It will cost Democrats.

National spotlight is on the mess in Minnesota

My home state of Minnesota remains in the national spotlight after a flurry of events involving ICE, residents, and Minnesota lawmakers. On Jan. 14, a judge allowed ICE operations in Minnesota to continue despite the fact that state officials are suing the Trump administration over his immigration crackdown, something they say is an authoritarian reach of power by President Donald Trump.

Several prosecutors in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division said they were resigning after they learned that the DOJ would not be opening an investigation into what happened during the shooting that led to Renee Nicole Good's death. For what it's worth, I think this is a mistake, not just for optics' sake but clarity.

Good's death sparked controversy and outrage over ICE's role in Minnesota and immigration issues at large. The mess in Minnesota has also demonstrated, probably, the single biggest difference between Republicans and Democrats right now.

Democrats want to upend our social contract

Minnesota's Democratic lawmakers, including Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who are outraged over ICE's very presence, have made this entire debacle much harder than it needs to be.

I understand that home raids, or ICE agents going door-to-door seems scary. ICE agents should strive to act in accordance with our laws. They should not behave like thugs. But they are in a difficult position: entering the U.S. illegally is already a crime. If Minnesota law enforcement apprehended more lawbreakers, there would be no need for ICE to participate in home raids or for ICE to swarm metro cities, arresting known rapists and drug traffickers.

Walz and Frey blame ICE's tactics for Minnesota's brewing civil unrest, but in reality, being soft on state and federal crime created the need for ICE to swoop in and enforce them.

I've been disappointed to see that since Obama's term ended in 2017 − perhaps as a reaction to Trump's presidency − the Democratic Party began viewing immigration, in particular, as laws that are optional and ICE as federal agents who aren't legitimate members of law enforcement. This seems to have encouraged former President Joe Biden to undo several Trump-era policies that helped secure the border, allowing a record number of migrants into the U.S. in 2023. ICE is now forced to rectify what Biden allowed.

Federal immigration laws are not just a cornerstone of America's sovereignty and well-being, but of most advanced countries. Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama believed this. The ideas of philosophers − Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau − reinforced this.

They are rooted in the idea that there is a delicate but vital social contract between citizens and governments: Individuals collectively give up some liberty and agree to obey laws to receive security, peace and order. Without this, there is chaos.

Democrats now seem to be openly advocating for the disruption of this social contract − even calling to defund or abolish ICE altogether.

Most Americans don't agree with or want this. Before the 2024 election, immigration was among the top concerns of most Americans.

The Trump administration could do its part better. They need not make this overtly political by trading jabs and smearing Democratic lawmakers. That riles everyone up more and is not a good example of leadership. But they must continue to systematically and methodically enforce immigration law, through ICE, and steer clear of actions, antics or optics that make it look like they are simply thugs hunting down innocent people for kicks.

Our social contract depends on this. Just ask Obama. Democrats upend this at their peril.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/13/USAT/88159938007-20260113-t-163347-z-1171368889-rc-2-f-0-jau-3-g-8-l-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpminnesota.JPG?crop=5494,3091,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-14 18:59:20.589586

This announcement follows Congresswoman McCollum’s Friday announcement(link is external) that she would support efforts to impeach Secretary Noem.

“Secretary Noem should be fired, but we know President Trump won’t do that. That’s why I support impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate for her obstruction of Congress and violation of the public trust,” said Congresswoman McCollum. “Over the past year, Americans in cities across the United States have felt the chaos and terror of Secretary Noem’s Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Secretary Noem has demonstrated that she is unable to enforce immigration law in a peaceful and ethical manner. Her deployment of unprofessional, poorly trained, masked immigration agents has put our neighbors in danger of physical harm. The appalling conduct at ICE and DHS starts with its leadership. Kristi Noem needs to go.”

The Constitution gives the U.S. House of Representatives the sole power of impeachment. Congresswoman McCollum is an original co-sponsor of Congresswoman Kelly’s three articles of impeachment:

1. Obstruction of Congress

Secretary Noem violated her constitutional oath and refused to comply with the law that prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from preventing a Member of Congress from entering a DHS facility used to detain undocumented immigrants. Members of Congress have been denied entry into ICE facilities in Minnesota, Illinois, Texas, Colorado, California, New York, Virginia, and Washington.

2. Violation of Public Trust

Secretary Noem has repeatedly violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First Amendments to the United States Constitution, and Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She’s also violated due process by directing ICE agents to conduct warrantless arrests and use violence against U.S. citizens and lawful residents.

During Secretary Noem’s “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, federal agents used excessive force, in some cases injuring or killing, residents. Federal agents used military-style tactics to raid an apartment building in South Shore, detaining U.S. citizens for hours without warrants or reason for arrest. These dangerous actions have continued in cities across the country, including in Minneapolis, where Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed without justification.

3. Self-Dealing

Secretary Noem has misused her position for personal gain while inappropriately using $200 million in public funds to award an ad campaign for ICE recruitment. She bypassed the standard competitive bidding process to award a contract to a firm called Strategy Group. Strategy Group was formed just days before the award and is run by the husband of senior DHS official Tricia McClaughlin, a close friend of Secretary Noem.

The State Department said in a social media post that the effort was meant to discourage immigration from countries “whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.” It did not provide a full list of the countries affected by the pause, but it confirmed that Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea would be included. It also did not specify the percentage of immigrants from those countries who use public assistance.

The announcement is part of the federal government’s crackdown on immigration, which has included efforts to upend legal pathways for migrants seeking to enter or stay in the United States. It also comes as the Trump administration conducts an immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota, the state with the largest population of Somalis in the United States.

Federal officials said that the pause would begin on Jan. 21 and would remain in place while the department reassesses its processing procedures. The suspension would not apply to people seeking to enter the United States temporarily for tourism, business or medical treatment.

“The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement.

Mr. Pigott said the department would “use its longstanding authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge,” referring to people who rely on government benefits.

The Trump administration has taken various steps in recent months to tighten legal pathways for migrants. The administration has already imposed full or partial travel restrictions on citizens from 39 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, Somalia and Chad. Federal officials have said the travel ban was necessary to protect national security.

The administration has also taken measures that could make it more difficult for certain immigrants already living in the United States to remain in the country. In December, the Department of Homeland Security put on hold immigration applications from citizens of the countries subject to the president’s travel ban, pausing their efforts to obtain benefits such as U.S. citizenship and green cards.

The announcement on Wednesday is also a reprisal of the Trump administration’s focus on immigrants who depend on public assistance. During Mr. Trump’s first term, his administration sought to deny green cards to immigrants who relied on public benefits such as food assistance and housing vouchers.

The Trump administration has also intensely focused on Somalis in recent weeks, deploying roughly 3,000 federal officers and agents to Minnesota. Federal officials said the move was meant to crack down on fraud and illegal immigration. On Tuesday, the Trump administration also said it would end temporary deportation protections for more than 2,000 Somali migrants living in the United States.

His administration’s focus on Minnesota came after revelations about a fraud scheme that siphoned money from social service programs in the state in recent years. More than 90 people have been charged in the federal fraud investigations, and most of the defendants are of Somali descent.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14trump-news-visas-JFK-wkcb/14trump-news-visas-JFK-wkcb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:19.508622

No immediate judicial decision on a request to stop the immigration crackdown

A judge made no immediate decision Wednesday on Minnesota's request to suspend the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the state, where federal agents have yanked people from cars and confronted angry bystanders demanding they pack up and leave.

Plumes of tear gas, the deployment of chemical irritants and the screech of protest whistles have become common on the streets of Minneapolis, especially since an immigration agent fatally shot Renee Good in the head on Jan. 7 as she drove away.

""What we need most of all right now is a pause. The temperature needs to be lowered,"" state Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez promised to keep the case ""on the front burner"" and gave the U.S. Justice Department until Monday to file a response to the request for a restraining order. Local leaders say the government is violating free speech and other constitutional rights with the surge of law enforcement.

Menendez said the state and cities will have a few more days to respond.

""It is simply recognition that these are grave and important matters,"" the judge said of the timetable, noting there are few legal precedents to apply to some of the key points in the case.

Government attorney Andrew Warden suggested the slower approach set by Menendez was appropriate.

The Department of Homeland Security says it has made more than 2,000 arrests in the state since early December and is vowing to not back down.

The bill, Moulton said, would restore ICE funding to its previous annual level of $10 billion and repurpose the rest.
Cosponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. André Carson on Indiana, Darren Soto of Florida and Sylvia Garcia of Texas.
The shooting, according to multiple outlets, has threatened to destroy spending negotiations with some Democrats calling for a freeze on ICE funding even if it means another deadlock.
Asked whether ICE funding should be another shutdown issue for the minority party, Moulton said it “certainly should be,” adding that he has heard from multiple, unnamed Republicans who secretly disagree with the Trump administration’s escalating immigration operations.","Representative Seth Moulton Wednesday introduced a bill that would reverse a recent funding boost to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made through President Donald Trump’s signature budget reconciliation bill and reallocate the dollars to fund premium-lowering health care tax credits.

The bill comes after more than a dozen House Republicans broke from party leadership and sided with Democrats to pass an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that lapsed at the beginning of the new year. Negotiators in the U.S. Senate are now reportedly finalizing a compromise measure to revive the subsidies.

“We absolutely want to extend the ACA premiums tax credits, they shouldn’t be lapsing, but we’re funding it by taking money from ICE’s budget,” said Moulton in an interview, calling the Trump administration’s priorities “completely out of whack.”

“The One Big Beautiful Bill nearly triples ICE’s budget at a time when American families across the country are facing higher premiums due to the ACA premiums tax credit lapsing,” said Moulton referring to the Trump administration’s signature spending package that gave ICE $75 billion in funding through 2029.

The bill, Moulton said, would restore ICE funding to its previous annual level of $10 billion and repurpose the rest. Cosponsors include Democratic U.S. Reps. André Carson on Indiana, Darren Soto of Florida and Sylvia Garcia of Texas.

Moulton’s bill also comes as public outrage grows over the recent killing of a woman by an ICE agent in Minnesota, and as Congress struggles to piece together spending measures ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline to avoid another shutdown. The shooting, according to multiple outlets, has threatened to destroy spending negotiations with some Democrats calling for a freeze on ICE funding even if it means another deadlock.

The latest shutdown lasted a record 43 days as Democrats refused to support a funding deal that allowed the health care subsidies to expire. Eventually, a portion of Democrats voted to support a GOP deal to reopen the government.

Asked whether ICE funding should be another shutdown issue for the minority party, Moulton said it “certainly should be,” adding that he has heard from multiple, unnamed Republicans who secretly disagree with the Trump administration’s escalating immigration operations.

“What happened in Minnesota was an outright murder for anyone who can look at it with their own two eyes, and we should not be funding the continuation of ICE terrorizing American cities,” said Moulton.

The Trump administration has defended the shooting in the name of self defense.

“A lot of GOP colleagues are privately concerned about ICE,” Mouton said. “One approached me after the Minnesota shooting and said that as a former law enforcement official himself, he thinks it’s criminal what happened, but they won’t say any of this out loud because they’re too scared of Donald Trump.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/d21ab5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5248x2755+0+372/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2F5d%2F58190f000ec7699b087344d6112a%2Fap20043631430758.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:25.331150

The contract, under the task force model adopted by Harran, allowed local law enforcement officers to be trained by the federal agency to collaborate and carry out some immigration enforcement activities.
That model “grants extraordinary powers to local law enforcement agencies,” Ceisler said.
“We acknowledge that, along with local law enforcement and our criminal justice system, our unified goal is the pursuit of justice,” Roux told the crowd.

Bucks County Sheriff Danny Ceisler officially withdrew his office from a collaboration agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday, citing public safety concerns and the need to reestablish trust between local law enforcement and the county’s more than 50,000 immigrant residents.

“When large numbers of our residents are afraid to call 911, or come to court and testify, that makes our entire community less safe,” Ceisler told a small crowd Wednesday in front of the Bucks County Justice Center. “This is not a public safety problem for immigrants. This is a public safety problem for everyone.”

Sheriff’s deputies are now prohibited from asking crime victims, witnesses and court observers about their immigration status per the order Ceisler signed this morning.

Former Sheriff Fred Harran signed the 287(g) agreement with ICE last spring, triggering widespread backlash and a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania that argues Harran did not have the authority to enter into the agreement without the approval of county commissioners. In October, a judge upheld Harran’s authority and rejected a preliminary injunction order seeking to stay implementation of the program.

The contract, under the task force model adopted by Harran, allowed local law enforcement officers to be trained by the federal agency to collaborate and carry out some immigration enforcement activities.

That model “grants extraordinary powers to local law enforcement agencies,” Ceisler said. “It allows them to stop anybody, detain anybody who they believe is in the country without current authorization.”

Harran argued that the sheriff’s office would only assist ICE in detaining people who have committed “serious” crimes.

Sixteen sheriff’s deputies underwent training to participate in the program, Ceiseler said, but Harran never fully implemented the collaboration.

Ceisler, a U.S. Army veteran, campaigned heavily on the issue in the 2025 elections, vowing to withdraw from the program. The Democrat won more than 55% of the vote to oust Harran, a Republican.

“This is what was on voters’ minds, and we won, and we won handily,” Ceisler said Wednesday.

Immigrant rights advocate and Bucks County resident Heidi Roux said the immigrant community is “breathing a collective sigh of relief.”

Because of the agreement, Roux said that some immigrant community members feared calling 911 or coming to the courthouse to pay a parking ticket.

“We acknowledge that, along with local law enforcement and our criminal justice system, our unified goal is the pursuit of justice,” Roux told the crowd. “Violent criminals should absolutely be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their immigration status. I believe criminal activity can be addressed while simultaneously supporting the human rights and the dignity of all of our residents.”

Bucks is ‘not a so-called sanctuary county’

Ceisler said that the county “has not severed all ties with ICE, nor precluded future partnership with ICE when it comes to dangerous criminals.” The county “is not, has never been, and will never be a so-called sanctuary county,” he said.

“We will ensure that actual criminals, people involved in human trafficking, fentanyl distribution, child exploitation, violent crime and fraud and are in the country illegally are deported, which had been the standard practice in Bucks County for decades,” he said.

The county’s Department of Corrections shares data and fingerprints from anyone booked in the system via a database called LiveScan, Ceisler said, which is accessible to ICE and hundreds of other law enforcement agencies across the country. Bucks County correctional facilities continue to honor ICE judicial warrants, he said.

“After months of open dialogue with our local police chiefs and community leaders, they have affirmed that this is the right balance between protecting our community from crime and protecting our community from fear,” Ceisler said.

Ceisler condemned Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal’s remarks last week calling ICE “fake, wannabe law enforcement” as “counter-productive.” Bilal “blurred jurisdictional lines,” Ceisler said, and “stepped on the toes of [Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin] Bethel.”

“I understand that many people are angry and frustrated, but we all have our role and responsibility in this process, and as a law enforcement executive, what she did is not it,” he said.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ceisler-ice-agreement-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:29.669364

“Our caucus will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, said during a press conference.

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.

Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants.

Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion.

“We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”

Progressives press Jeffries

The Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Dexter of Oregon.

Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds.

“They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that’s taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership.

While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress.

But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order.

There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits.

Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.”

Investigations urged

Jayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”

Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.

“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.

Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.

“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.

Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.

“We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said.",https://theoutlookonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2026/01/Rep.-Ilhan-Omar-a-Minnesota-Democrat-speaks-at-a-press-conference-with-members-of-the-Congress.jpg?w=648,N,,2026-01-14 18:59:07.947378

You use Google?” the current ICE agent said.
Some retired agents have also been invited by ICE to rejoin the force, but according to the former ICE agent, the risk of going back outweighs staying retired.","The current and former agents spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on the record on behalf of the agency.

The DHS told TIME that Good had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them—an act of domestic terrorism.”

But videos of the incident contradict that account. They appear to show Ross positioned to the side of Good’s vehicle when he fired three shots that killed her, with her wheels turned away from him.

Both the former agent and the current agent also questioned why Ross was assigned to this operation in the first place, given a previous injury involving a driver at the wheel of a vehicle just a few months before the confrontation with Good.

“That, to me, has red flags all over it,” the former ICE agent said.

“So when this person took off, I'm sure that prior incident came to mind, because he's an experienced officer. And then he just reacted, in my opinion, not in the correct way,” the former agent added.

Last Monday, the Trump administration deployed roughly 2,000 agents from ICE to the Twin Cities area amid a growing fraud scandal at day care centers run by Somali residents. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media that the agents are there to conduct “ a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud.”

The current ICE agent pointed out that while the pretense of the immigration operation in Minneapolis is to investigate welfare fraud, neither border patrol officers nor ICE agents in charge of deportation, also known as Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers, are trained to investigate financial fraud.

“You can't train someone to do all the basic law enforcement stuff, let alone the law. Immigration law used to be a five or six-month course at the academy. How do you know that people are here legally unless you know the law? You use Google?” the current ICE agent said.

The former ICE agent also said that this rushed training could lead to a domino effect as more senior ICE agents plan for retirement, and the new recruits, who didn’t have as much legal and enforcement training as previous generations, fill the gap.

Some retired agents have also been invited by ICE to rejoin the force, but according to the former ICE agent, the risk of going back outweighs staying retired.

“The biggest concern is jeopardizing your pension. And then, of course, violating the law. If you're ordered and you know that you're violating the law and you say no, then you stand a chance of being terminated. And then you jeopardize your pension,” the former agent said, adding that some officers are asked to work for 16-hour shifts six to seven days a week. “For most of us, it's not worth it.”

Even before Good’s shooting, public support for the agency has been dropping sharply. A YouGov poll conducted the same day as the shooting killing found that 52% of respondents now either somewhat or strongly disapproved of how ICE was handling its job, compared to 39% who somewhat or strongly approved. For the first time, more people now support abolishing the agency than oppose it.

Asked about the public’s biggest misconception about ICE, both the current and former agent said that ICE, like all government agencies, is at the mercy of the Administration.

“Where was all this energy when the election was happening? Everyone knew this was what the Administration was going to do,” the agent said, adding that for the most part, the agents conducting deportations and arrests are not breaking the law.

“You're putting people in a position where they have to quit and try to find work in a really bad job market. So they justify themselves, and they say, hey, it's legal, and as long as I'm not violating rights or doing something immoral or illegal, I'm going to do it because this is what the American voters voted for.”",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254678149.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1,N,,2026-01-14 15:59:10.105506

Migration policy experts also warned the move will have far-reaching consequences beyond those directly affected by visa denials.","The Donald Trump administration has indefinitely suspended immigrant visa processing for people from 75 countries, marking one of its most expansive efforts yet to restrict legal pathways to the United States.

The freeze, which takes effect on 21 January, targets applicants officials deem likely to become a “public charge” – who they describe as people who may rely on government benefits for basic needs.

The state department wrote on social media that it “will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates”.

The Guardian obtained a state department cable with the full list of countries affected.

“The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people,” the statement continued. “We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused.”

The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration has intensified to record levels, even as nationwide protests over the killing of Renee Good have drawn attention to law enforcement practices. The state department says it revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump returned to office, while the homeland security department reported last month that more than 605,000 people have been deported, while an additional 2.5 million left the country on their own.

The administration has particularly focused on Somali Americans following fraud allegations and federal investigations in Minnesota. Trump referred to the Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar as “garbage” during a cabinet meeting last month and said he did not want Somalis in the US and they should “go back to where they came from”.

The pause follows Trump’s December expansion of travel bans to 39 countries, suspension of asylum processing, and halting of citizenship and green card applications for citizens of countries already subject to restrictions.

Research contradicts administration claims about immigrant welfare use. In February 2025, the libertarian Cato Institute published a paper showing that native-born Americans consumed, on an average per capita basis, more welfare and entitlement benefits than all immigrants. The study found immigrants consumed 21% fewer welfare and entitlement benefits than native-born Americans on a per capita basis in 2022.

Migration policy experts also warned the move will have far-reaching consequences beyond those directly affected by visa denials.

“The likely result will be that many immigrant families will be afraid to access any public benefits for which a household member is eligible, forgoing supports in times of need to preserve future immigration prospects,” Julia Gelatt, associate director of the US immigration policy program at the Migration Policy Institute, wrote in an analysis posted on Wednesday.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ba42c16b4c0adaa21271947f5936cb3231c20f/387_0_4409_3526/master/4409.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7e530d704caf8e6c48bb58af15eac95",N,,2026-01-14 15:58:57.936413

The State Department issued its advisory for Americans.
But only weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course on the 18-month extension.
The Trump administration also noted in a public register notice that the designation was not in the U.S.’s national interests even if conditions warranted them.","The Trump administration is publishing contrasting information about on-the-ground conditions in Venezuela, raising questions about how different agencies are making policy decisions towards Venezuela and its nationals in the U.S., as well as American travelers.

The Department of Homeland Security, when ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela in February 2025, said that while some conditions for the deportation protections continue, there have been “notable improvements” in sectors like the economy, public health and crime. That made it possible for Venezuelans “to be safely returned.”

But in a recent security alert on Jan. 10, the State Department urged any Americans to depart Venezuela immediately. It emphasized reports that pro-regime groups were stopping people for evidence of U.S. citizenship or U.S. support and highlighted the risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, kidnapping, crime, poor health infrastructure and civil unrest.

The safety alert from the State Department comes days after the United States bombed military installations in Caracas and snatched Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. It also comes as uncertainty around Venezuela’s political future has renewed calls in the U.S. to restore TPS for the over half-a-million Venezuelans residing in the U.S. who lost the protections.

The United States has said since 2019 that U.S. citizens should not visit Venezuela for any reason, and its embassy in Caracas suspended diplomatic operations and consular services that same year.

Both the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department told the Miami Herald that the descriptions of Venezuela agency communications and documents about conditions in Venezuela are not inconsistent with each other.

“The State Department’s travel messaging is for American citizens and is written with their safety in mind. Noting that it may be safe for Venezuelans, does not mean it is safe for Americans,” spokespersons for both agencies in separate statements.

A spokesperson for the State Department said that “the Trump administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas.” Meanwhile, Tricia McLaughlin at DHS said “there is no discrepancy here. The State Department issued its advisory for Americans. You seem to be under the impression that the United States is here to serve foreigners and act as a forever haven for gang members, rapists, drug dealers and narco terrorists.”

The State Department’s “Do not travel” advisory, reissued Dec. 3 without changes, says that violent crimes like armed robbery and homicides are common; that the government is engaged in a brutal crackdown against opposition groups; that shortages of basic supplies like gasoline, electricity, and water are commonplace throughout much of the country; and that access to medical care is limited and that facilities may not have basic medications available.

“You cannot warn Americans not to travel to Venezuela because of extreme risk, persecution and danger, while simultaneously telling Venezuelans in the United States that they can safely return because the country is now safe for them. That contradiction is not just policy inconsistency, it is a failure of common sense, humanitarian responsibility and due process,” said Adelys Ferro, the director of the Venezuelan-American Caucus.

Independent groups like Human Rights Watch say the Venezuelan government intimidates human rights advocates, arrests and detains protesters and harasses journalists. There are also armed gangs in border states that control daily life and pro-regime groups that intimidate opposition candidates, according to the watchdog organization.

Nearly 8 million people have fled Venezuela in the past decade In the last days of the Biden administration, the Department of Homeland Security extended Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela another year and a half, citing the “severe humanitarian emergency.” About 5.1 million Venezuelans live with hunger and 53% of the population in extreme poverty, according to the United Nations.

But only weeks later, the Trump administration reversed course on the 18-month extension. It noted the “notable improvements” in certain conditions that allowed for a safe return and warranted the end of TPS. The Trump administration also noted in a public register notice that the designation was not in the U.S.’s national interests even if conditions warranted them.

“Temporary Protected Status is meant to be just that: temporary. President Trump is bringing stability to Venezuela and bringing to justice an illegitimate Narco Terrorist dictator who stole from his own people. Secretary Noem ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 500,000 Venezuelans and now they can go home to a country that they love,” said McLaughlin.

Human Rights First, which tracks Immigration and Customs Enforcement removals, said in a Jan. 9 report that the Trump administration has not sent any deportation flights to Venezuela since Dec. 10. Last month, the Venezuelan government announced that the federal government had unilaterally suspended its twice-weekly deportations amid escalating tensions.

It remains to be seen how ongoing negotiations following Maduro’s capture will impact future deportations.

In a recent letter, U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Darren Soto of Florida, along with Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, asked the Trump administration to bring back TPS for Venezuela in the wake of Maduro’s capture, which has left his former vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, as interim president.

“The Trump Administration’s calamitous decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in January 2025 was rooted in a determination that conditions in the country had improved,” the lawmakers wrote. “This claim was baseless at the time, and, with the regime left in place, it is certainly untrue now.”",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/kqlgmm/picture314147088/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/GettyImages-2253875369.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:58:33.995116

""Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,"" he added.

The move was first reported by Fox News.

Trump has pursued a sweeping immigration crackdown since returning to office in January. His administration has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and sparking violent confrontations with both migrants and U.S. citizens.

While he campaigned on stopping illegal immigration into the United States, his administration has made legal immigration more difficult, for example, by imposing new and expensive fees on the applicants of H-1B visas for highly skilled workers.

""This administration has proven itself to have the most anti-legal immigration agenda in American history,"" David Bier, Cato’s Director of Immigration Studies and The Selz Foundation Chair in Immigration Policy, said in a statement.

""This action will ban nearly half of all legal immigrants to the United States, turning away about 315,000 legal immigrants over the next year alone,"" Bier said.

Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

The State Department has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump took office, it said on Monday. The administration has also adopted a stricter policy on granting visas, with tightened social media vetting and expanded screening.

In November, Trump had vowed to ""permanently pause"" migration from all ""Third World Countries"" following a shooting near the White House by an Afghan national that killed a National Guard member.

The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.

""Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.""

President Donald Trump's administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

The November guidance on which Wednesday's decision is based directed U.S. embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S.

While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn't be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.

Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations.

The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants' English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.

Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already tightening those rules.

Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will die.” As many as 2,800 grantees through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa) received a letter immediately ending their funding – about 26% of Samhsa’s entire budget.
Many of these programs are on the frontlines of mental health and substance use, functioning as the first point of contact for people who need care.
“Overnight, our entire backbone and infrastructure of addiction and mental health in this country flipped up on its head,” Hampton said.
The administration’s goals include “innovative programs and interventions” to reduce mental illness, substance use, overdoses and suicide, the letter said.","The Trump administration on Tuesday evening unexpectedly canceled up to $1.9bn in funding for substance use and mental health care, which providers say will immediately affect thousands of patients.

“It feels like Armageddon for everyone who’s on the frontlines of the addiction and mental health space,” said Ryan Hampton, founder of Mobilize Recovery, a national advocacy organization for people in and seeking recovery.

“The scope of care that’s disrupted by these grants is catastrophic. Tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will die.”

As many as 2,800 grantees through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa) received a letter immediately ending their funding – about 26% of Samhsa’s entire budget.

Staff at Samhsa were not consulted on the cuts or even told they were happening, according to two sources familiar with the cuts who asked for anonymity to speak about sensitive matters. The agency also endured massive cuts throughout 2025.

Providers woke up this morning to learn they would need to lay off staff and end programs immediately, Hampton said. Many of these programs are on the frontlines of mental health and substance use, functioning as the first point of contact for people who need care.

“These are programs that save lives, so the impact could be really devastating,” said Regina LaBelle, former acting director of the Biden White House office of national drug control policy and professor at Georgetown University.

“It really covers the spectrum of prevention, treatment and recovery services, both on substance use and mental health,” said Yngvild Olsen, who until last July served as the director for the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment at Samhsa and is now a national adviser at Manatt Health.

The cuts will affect overdose-prevention work, naloxone distribution and use by first responders, mental health and substance use support within schools, support for pregnant and postpartum women who receive assistance for substance use disorder, underage drinking prevention and recovery support programs – all cut without warning.

“Overnight, our entire backbone and infrastructure of addiction and mental health in this country flipped up on its head,” Hampton said. “These grants are lifesaving tools that honestly are a good reason why we have started to see a reversal in trends of drug overdoses in this country.”

Overdoses soared over the past two decades, but in recent years they began falling. In 2024, the US overdose rate dropped by 27%. Now, with these abrupt cuts, “a lot of lives are going to be lost”, Hampton said. “A lot of harm is happening in real time this morning.”

The cuts “came as a surprise, given all the changes that grantees had already made in response to executive orders and Samhsa guidance”, Olsen said. “This potentially could have an unbelievably disruptive impact on people’s access to services. It could mean really thousands of people losing access to the treatment.”

The funding was appropriated by Congress to Samhsa, which then disburses funding to organizations around the country. Congress does not appear to have been involved in the cancellations. Republicans and Democrats have been negotiating funding, and these cuts seem to be politically motivated, said LaBelle, who added: “We didn’t know that the administration would just basically use their regulatory authority to pull the plug.”

The awards were terminated because they no longer aligned with the Trump administration’s priorities, according to a letter to grantees from Christopher Carroll, the deputy assistant secretary at Samhsa, obtained by the Guardian. The administration’s goals include “innovative programs and interventions” to reduce mental illness, substance use, overdoses and suicide, the letter said.

“You can’t tell me that naloxone distribution, providing mental health support in schools, providing outreach to get people into treatment who are unhoused, providing drug court services, that these are not in line with administration priorities. They are 100% in line with administration priorities, as stated by the administration as recently as two or three months ago,” Hampton said.

“All of us are in a state of complete and utter shock that the administration would take such a reckless action.”

The cuts are for nearly all discretionary funds, which account for nearly $2bn of Samhsa’s budget. The grants that were not affected include the state opioid response block grants, the certified community behavioral clinics program, and the 988 hotline.

Samhsa did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s inquiry about whether staff were consulted or informed of these changes and how they would affect care.

The cuts were made under the same rule as previous health agency layoffs and cutbacks, which were successfully challenged in court.

“My hope is that this will go to court and the courts will stop it,” Hampton said. But “the harm is happening in real time right now, and as this gets sorted out in the courts, people will die. People will die.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/489573a411a21951fbaac3e40c36ceb70f5b6c19/900_7_4135_3307/master/4135.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=61c2e8a7b5c971076dd6d0bc1dd2650b",N,,2026-01-14 16:58:26.255033

And indeed, the chief justice found that Representative Mike Bost, the Illinois Republican who challenged his state’s election rules, clearly had that kind of stake in the outcome.
They argued that allowing mail-in ballots to arrive after Election Day and still be counted ran counter to Congress’s intent.","The Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with a conservative congressman who had sued over rules in Illinois that allow mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after an election.

The question in the case was not the rule itself but whether a political candidate has the right to challenge the rules governing the vote count in the candidate’s election.

A majority of the court found that the answer was yes.

The justices have said they will hear a more significant case evaluating the legality of late-arriving mail-in ballots later this year. That case will test rules in Mississippi that allow the counting of ballots received after Election Day.

But many election law experts had warned that a decision in the congressman’s favor in Wednesday’s case could clear the way for a host of lawsuits challenging all kinds of election rules in states throughout the country, particularly from Republicans who have advanced a narrative that some state rules, especially involving mail-in ballots, unfairly favor Democrats.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, said the Constitution required a legal challenger to have a “personal stake” in a case in order to sue. And indeed, the chief justice found that Representative Mike Bost, the Illinois Republican who challenged his state’s election rules, clearly had that kind of stake in the outcome. Mr. Bost argued that his campaign would incur extra costs to monitor the counting of late-arriving ballots.

“He is a candidate for office,” the chief justice wrote. “And a candidate has a personal stake in the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.”

The case is one of several lawsuits brought by allies of President Trump challenging rules around mail-in ballots after his 2020 election loss. Mr. Trump has long falsely blamed fraud resulting from the increased use of mail-in ballots during the pandemic in part for his loss.

The court’s other conservatives joined the chief justice in the outcome, although Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, a liberal, wrote separately to say they would have found for Mr. Bost for slightly different reasons. The court’s other two liberals, Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented.

Chief Justice Roberts analogized the congressional elections to a 100-meter dash. He wrote that each runner would suffer if the race were “unexpectedly extended to 105 meters.” In much the same way, he wrote, “an unlawful extension of vote counting,” if one took place, would deprive candidates “of the opportunity to compete for election.”

Justices Barrett and Kagan said Mr. Bost had standing to sue because he had shown he suffered a financial injury, not because he was a political candidate.

Justice Barrett, in her concurrence, wrote that Mr. Bost had “suffered a traditional pocketbook injury” because of his increased campaign costs to monitor the ballots received after Election Day.

In her dissent, Justice Jackson said the majority had incorrectly carved out “a bespoke rule” for political candidates in a decision that “now complicates and destabilizes” the court’s standing rules and “America’s electoral processes.”

In a statement, Mr. Bost said he was thankful the court had ruled in his favor, a decision he called “a critically important step forward in the fight for election integrity and fair elections.”

A spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. (As a result of the ruling, Mr. Bost’s lawsuit can now proceed in lower courts.)

The case is one of a number related to elections pending before the justices. In October, they heard arguments in a dispute over Louisiana’s congressional district map. That case, Louisiana v. Callais, began as a traditional fight over whether the map was an illegal racial gerrymander, but the justices significantly broadened the question last summer to include an evaluation of what role race can play in drawing electoral maps. That move called into question whether the Supreme Court would gut the Voting Rights Act, a landmark law from the civil rights era.

In the Mississippi case that will be heard later this term, Watson v. Republican National Committee, the committee, along with the state’s Republican Party and some individual voters, sued in 2024 over the state’s rules for mail-in ballots.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

The three articles of impeachment were introduced by Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly. Nearly 70 Democrats have co-signed, but as the minority party in both chambers, any support or movement for the articles will likely only occur if Democrats win the midterm elections and flip the House.

“She needs to be held accountable for her actions,” Kelly said. “Renee Nicole Good is dead because Secretary Noem allowed her DHS agents to run amok.”

On Jan. 7, 37-year-old Renee Good was shot and killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. Federal immigration officers have intensified immigration enforcement, leading to massive pushback from the community there and protests across the country.

The articles from Kelly accuse Noem of obstructing Congress after lawmakers were denied oversight visits at DHS facilities that hold immigrants; violating public trust through due process violations of U.S. citizens’ and immigrants’ rights and aggressive warrantless arrests in immigration enforcement; and misusing $200 million in taxpayer funds by awarding a contract to a company run by the husband of DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, according to ProPublica.

A dozen members of Congress have sued Noem over those denied visits at ICE facilities to conduct oversight and were granted a stay to that policy by a federal judge. But Noem issued a new policy and last weekend several Minnesota lawmakers were blocked from visits to ICE facilities.

A federal judge is currently probing to see if the new policy from Noem violates her court order from December.

Kelly was joined by several Democrats, including Minnesota’s Angie Craig, who represents a swing district.

“We are being terrorized by Homeland Security and ICE,” Craig said. “This has crossed a line. This rogue agency is violating the rights of American citizens in our communities, and last Wednesday … the escalation by ICE in our communities got Renee Good killed.”

Noem would not be the only Homeland Secretary to be impeached, should the House take that action.

In 2024, Republicans impeached the Biden administration’s DHS secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, on the grounds that he lied to Congress that the southern border was secure and that he violated his duty when he rolled back several Trump-era immigration policies.

The Senate, then controlled by Democrats, dismissed the articles of impeachment.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2026-01/kristinoemmay82025.jpg?h=616f4463&itok=3bzKipV5,N,,2026-01-14 14:57:53.840429

It also lowered the standard of review for those determinations.

“One thing is clear — this administration doesn’t want us to know what goes on inside these facilities,” Rep. Emily Randall, D-Bremerton, said in a statement to The Seattle Times. “Accountability is not optional.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued the rule late last week, a day after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis. The incident sparked nationwide outrage and calls — including by Randall — to impeach Noem.

Citing violence against ICE facilities, Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that all requests by members of Congress to enter ICE detention facilities must be made “at least seven days in advance.”

“This was done in order to ensure the safety of staff, law enforcement, visitors and detainees alike,” McLaughlin said.

The privately run Northwest ICE Processing Center is one of the largest detention centers nationwide, with 1,575 beds. Advocates have decried the conditions for years, and government agencies and human rights groups have published wide-ranging concerns. It’s among various detention centers across the country that Democratic members of Congress have descended on for spontaneous oversight visits in the last year as the Trump administration ramped up immigration detentions and raids.

In April, Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey was charged with two counts of assault after trying to block the arrest of Newark’s mayor during a tour of the city’s detention facility. Randall said the Tacoma facility denied her entry in August, and over the weekend, Minnesota Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig and Kelly Morrison said they were denied entry to a detention center in Minneapolis.

Randall visited the Tacoma facility three days before Homeland Security published the new rule. “I heard again and again from detainees that they’re being denied proper medical care, and conditions continue to worsen,” Randall said.

It’s the federal agency’s second attempt at such a policy: A federal judge last month rejected a similar rule by Noem, stating that federal spending laws require unrestricted congressional visits to ICE detention facilities. Noem sidestepped the decision by leaning on a funding technicality: the judge said that funding derived from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is exempt from the limitation.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, who last visited the Tacoma facility in May, characterized the move as an attempt by the administration to hide the center’s poor conditions.

“The law allows members of Congress to conduct unannounced visits to ICE facilities whenever we want, no advanced notice or permission needed,” Jayapal said in a statement to The Seattle Times. “We are the authorizing and funding branch of government, and it is absolutely outrageous that DHS is trying yet again to prevent members from conducting our oversight responsibility.”

Jayapal, who is ranking member of the Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement Subcommittee, will host a field hearing Friday with Omar in St. Paul, Minn., to review actions by the Trump administration and ICE in Minneapolis and hear from witnesses.

Josefina Mora-Cheung, director of organizing at immigrant advocacy group La Resistencia NW, said she worries about the conditions that detained immigrants are facing, and that they may be aggravated without proper oversight.

“It’s funny that they would say it’s for the safety of people in detention” Mora-Cheung said. “It’s not about safety.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01132026_2_110003.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:00.546352

With whistles and chants, cowbells and clanging pots, demonstrators gathered Tuesday night outside the Hyatt Regency Morristown to loudly protest the weekend’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions.

A Morristown High School senior, Juan Daniel Mendoza, was among several individuals rounded up Sunday morning near a Speedwell Avenue laundromat.

“I hear there are people saying that he is 19, that he’s in a gang back in Honduras, and that’s just not true. He’s a school student. He’s 17. He’s just trying to get an education,” said MHS freshman Zoe Lopez.

The Morris County Sheriff’s Office backed up Morristown cops, who estimated the crowd at 300. It was boisterous yet peaceful; officers occasionally reminded participants to be careful about keeping clear of traffic.

Some motorists honked in solidarity with people chanting “ICE out of Morristown” or waving flags from Honduras, Guatemala and Colombia. A couple of upside-down U.S. flags symbolized a nation in distress under President Trump’s immigration policies.

Video by Andrew Dutton and Kevin Coughlin for MorristownGreen.com:

Other demonstrators bore signs remembering Renee Nicole Good, an activist shot in Minneapolis last week by an ICE officer who claimed it was self-defense.

“People are getting killed, people are getting hurt, and people are getting taken. And we … don’t know what happened to them…that’s the issue, the lawlessness and the lack of accountability and the cruelty,” said recent MHS grad Miles Gorman.

“They are behaving lawlessly and cruelly, and nobody wants them here,” a woman named Liz said of ICE, over her cacophonous cowbell.

‘NOT A DREAM PLACE ANYMORE’

The throng included at least one Congressional candidate.

“I’m out here because this is home… we want to show that New Jersey stands with its neighbors, its friends and its family, and that ICE is not welcome here,” said Zach Beecher of Morristown, running for Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill’s former 11th District seat. Congress should fix the immigration system, he said, instead of funding “punitive, targeted raids that are based on politics and not on policy.”

Further down the sidewalk, Alexis Lake of Sussex and her friend Jackie Malone of Madison craned for a better view.

“Morristown runs on immigrants,” Lake said. “We have immigrants everywhere. They are our family, our friends, our co-workers, and it’s not right what’s happening right now.”

Lake is against open borders. “But for people that are here that are working that haven’t committed a crime, there’s no reason that they should be taken off the streets in the ways that we are seeing,” she said.

“My kids grew up here, they went to school here,” explained Morristown resident Dave Olander. “They enjoyed the diversity, and they are part of the community. I anticipated something like…this raid that happened over the weekend. And this just can’t happen.”

TAKING A STAND

Madeline Nelson, 34, emigrated from Haiti as a teen and is grateful for opportunities that enabled her to become a nurse practitioner.

“I just think that this is a time for people to take a stand,” Nelson said.

“I’m an immigrant, and I love this country. America is a great country. Wherever you are in the world, you dream of America. That was the past. I feel like now, people don’t think of America as a place to come anymore. It’s not a dream place anymore.”

Joel Tapia, 25, handed out more than 200 whistles, for blowing warnings when ICE is in the neighborhood. He was born in Denville, but his parents hail from Uruguay.

“I’m here because we have to remember that at the end of the day, if we don’t stand for something, we will fall for everything,” Tapia said. “The only thing that’s really a threat is the chaos that (ICE is) creating.”

Twenty-eight-year-old Keyri Escobar of Morristown organized the protest; she heard rumors that ICE agents were bunking at the Hyatt.

Escobar’s parents survived a perilous journey from El Salvador to the U.S. “I started this because I myself, and my parents, are immigrants. My parents have been here since 1995, working their ass off, paying taxes, giving me a better life.”

Haverford Township commissioners have voted Monday night to restrict the police department from aiding United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on noncriminal federal immigration policies.

Following last week’s fatal shooting of a woman in Minneapolis, Commissioner Laura Cavender sponsored the resolution for the meeting on Monday night.

Cavender said the resolution speaks to the township’s values, affirms the police department practices, and draws an important boundary in that immigration policy should not be pushed onto local officers.

In July, Radnor Township passed a similar resolution that states the municipality will not enter into any 287G agreement, which would allow ICE officers to partner with municipal law enforcement to enforce federal immigration laws.

The wording at the agency website is “allows your law enforcement agency to enforce certain aspects of U.S. immigration law.”

According to U.S. census records, about 7 percent of the township, whose median household income is $127,000, is foreign born. Officials did not have an estimate on any number of illegal residents in the township.

A full house was on hand for the spirited discussion as residents and commissioners alike had a chance to present their views.

One resident said from a fiscal position signing a 287G agreement would cost the township financially with local police responsible for personnel expenses used in carrying out any mission while the officers were under ICE supervision.

“I don’t understand why we would imagine that entering into a 287G agreement would benefit us given that our property taxes go to pay for our public safety … ICE’s budget … has more than tripled. It’s now up to $27.5 billion annually, that’s more than all of the federal law enforcement agencies combined,” the resident said. “It is sufficiently funded.

Another speaker said the Minneapolis incident offers a teachable moment.

“In a situation involving law enforcement, even if concerned about actions of law enforcement, do not get directly involved, especially if you are operating a vehicle which is capable of becoming a weapon, keep your distance. If an officer tells you to do something, comply with what they ask,” he said.

Another man, who said he is a former police officer, opposed the resolution on the ground that, in his opinion, it puts residents, law enforcement and the future of the community at risk.

“Cooperating with ICE stops the engagement at street level,” he said. “It puts the engagements exactly where they belong, in detention centers.”

He went on to say reports that “jack booted” ICE agents ripping babies from their mothers and sending them back is not what is happening. That brought a groan from the audience, which consisted mostly of supporters of the resolution.

President Judy Trombetta quieted the crowd to allow the man to speak.

He finished repeating his oath when he became a police officer to uphold the constitution: “to protect the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.” He added, “And we have to protect this country from both foreign and domestic intrusion.”

One of the next speakers had a differing view.

“Clearly, ICE has overstepped,” she said.

She said what she sees is armed militia’s patrolling streets, dragging people from their cars and day care centers who are “on the hunt for people who are not breaking laws, and are only here to try to forge a better life for themselves and their families.”

She also noted the Boston Massacre was spurred when a militia was brought in to patrol the streets.

“We don’t like it. We haven’t liked it since the beginning of the Revolution,” she said in support of the resolution.

One resident asked if information from license plate readers is shared to track immigrants. Police Chief John Viola said to his knowledge that is not the case.

A woman said it is criminal to be here illegally, and she is worried that some undocumented immigrants who might be here, even if it is 1 percent, want to hurt us badly. She said police should support federal officers.

A woman speaking for the Havertown Community action group spoke strongly in support of the resolution.

“We have watched in horror as masked ICE agents have increasingly relied on violence, which has turned deadly as in the case of Renee Nicole Good,” she said. “Aggressive and unlawful ICE actions make our communities far less safe.”

One longtime resident said an illegal immigrant raped her 13-year-old niece. She said police had no facts on the man and the judge gave him a second chance and he then went on to impregnate three other women.

“I approve of ICE coming to Havertown … don’t we want to know who might want to hurt and kill our children … Dammit, we need to know who else is here, who has a criminal background,” she said.

She added the proclamation before the board is “laughable” and “come legally, become a citizen and do good.”

Haverford School Board member Chris Shelton reminded commissioners that in 2018 the school district adopted a resolution to welcome all students, regardless of immigration status.

“If the police department were to enter into any agreement with ICE, that would present where we could have students become at risk … I would ask the board to support the resolution in lines with the goals of the district,” he said.

‘Grandstanding’

One speaker who said he was a lawyer, compared the resolution to performance art, and in his opinion what has gone on to this point is legal.

He also asked if they have considered costs to the township could incur if the federal government decides to withhold funding or file suit against the township.

After reading on immigration law, another woman called the resolution “grandstanding” on the emotions of what has happened in Minnesota saying the law already exists.

Following the public time, Commissioner Larry Holmes said the Constitution protects everyone in the country, not just citizens. Holmes said he doesn’t want the township police department’s reputation to be hurt by the “reckless and criminal activity of ICE.”

Commissioner Brian Gondek said 287G actually consists of multiple programs.

He said he doesn’t like political theater and the topic creates a lot of hostility, which results in confusion. He said in reviewing the language of the resolution it would add to that confusion, adding to the combustion of the topic.

Gondek added ICE could still come into the town at any time and there is nothing the municipality can do.

Cavender said the feds don’t need local assistance.

“ICE does not need the assistance of our local government and they have been encouraging local municipalities to partner,” Cavander said, with that number growing by 600 percent.

Commissioner Kevin McCloskey said no one wants to see a 37-year-old mother get shot.

“None of us should want armed militia in the streets shooting us citizens at any point,” McCloskey said. “No disagreement, or blowing a whistle, or saying I don’t agree with what you are doing should ever lead to someone being shot by a trained officer of the federal government … it really shouldn’t be that complicated

Holmes said ICE has ignored laws and any benefit of the doubt they are entitled to “has been flushed down the toilet.”

Trombetta said she sees the resolution as a proactive measure so police are never put into an impossible situation between supporting federal requests and protecting all residents of the community.

She said the resolution makes clear police will enforce all criminal law but they will not be used as agents of federal civil immigration enforcement unless there is a judicial warrant signed by a judge. She said it protects civil liberties, protects safety and gives police officers clear direction.

“We are not refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement on criminal matters, we are not creating a sanctuary,” Trombeta said.

Gondek asked for an amendment on the wording, to include federal law, which was agreed to.

Trump’s immigration agenda reached a flash point last week following an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer fatally shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, a Minnesota woman federal officials allege impeded an ICE operation in Minneapolis by using her vehicle as a weapon.

Cellphone videos of the encounter have prompted a mix of reactions from officials and lawmakers.

The Illinois law allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted if they are received up to two weeks later. More than a dozen states, as well as the District of Columbia, accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, LA, New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham and communities east, north, to south to east to west” Kelly said in a press conference on Wednesday.
Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, said she filed three articles of impeachment against Noem – obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self-dealing – and has the backing of 70 members of Congress.
They accuse the secretary of willfully obstructing congressional oversight by withholding appropriated funds and repeatedly blocking lawmakers from entering DHS facilities.
House Democratic leaders have not endorsed Kelly’s impeachment effort, which is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House.","The Democratic representative Robin Kelly on Wednesday formally introduced articles of impeachment against Donald Trump’s homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, following the fatal shooting of a US citizen by an immigration agent in Minneapolis last week.

“Secretary Noem has brought her reign of terror to the Chicagoland area, LA, New Orleans, Charlotte, Durham and communities east, north, to south to east to west” Kelly said in a press conference on Wednesday. “She needs to be held accountable for her actions”.

The new push comes amid mounting national outrage over the death of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, killed at the wheel of her car on a residential street by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer during high-octane deployments of law enforcement in cities and towns across the country.

Kelly, an Illinois Democrat, said she filed three articles of impeachment against Noem – obstruction of Congress, violation of public trust, and self-dealing – and has the backing of 70 members of Congress.

While Noem and the Trump administration have characterized the incident as an act of “domestic terrorism” by a “professional agitator”, video evidence and local officials have sharply contested that narrative. The Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, described the shooting as a reckless use of power and demanded the agency leave the city. The administration has responded by sending more federal agents, as tensions between officers and residents escalate.

“How silly during a serious time. As ICE officers are facing a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, Rep. Kelly is more focused on showmanship and fundraising clicks than actually cleaning up her crime-ridden Chicago district,” said a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. “We hope she would get serious about doing her job to protect American people, which is what this Department is doing under Secretary Noem.”

In response, Kelly said of Noem: “You have violated your oath of office and there will be consequences.”

Late last year, the representative Delia Ramirez, a fellow Illinois Democrat, moved to impeach Noem, amid an immigration crackdown in Chicago.

They accuse the secretary of willfully obstructing congressional oversight by withholding appropriated funds and repeatedly blocking lawmakers from entering DHS facilities. It further alleges a violation of public trust through the use of “warrantless arrests” and the use of “violence against US citizens and lawful individuals”. It also charges Noem with self-dealing for “inappropriately” using taxpayer dollars to fund an ad campaign for ICE recruitment, and awarding the $200m recruitment contract to a firm run by the husband of the senior DHS official and chief spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin.

Despite rising fury among Democrats over the administration’s increasingly violent enforcement tactics, the party is at odds over how to respond. House Democratic leaders have not endorsed Kelly’s impeachment effort, which is unlikely to succeed in the Republican-controlled House. Other Democrats have called for using an upcoming government funding deadline to try to rein in ICE and slash funding to the agency. Kelly, who is running in a competitive Democratic primary to replace retiring Senator Dick Durbin in Illinois, has positioned herself more aggressively on the issue than leadership.

“We haven’t ruled anything in and we haven’t ruled anything out. Everything is on the table from the standpoint of complete and total accountability,” the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, told reporters on Monday. Noem, Jeffries added, was “completely and totally unqualified” and should be “run out of town as soon as possible” but he questioned whether impeachment was “the best way to accomplish that objective”.

In 2024, House Republicans impeached Joe Biden’s secretary of homeland security, Alejandro Mayorkas, breaking precedent and pushing through charges that even some in their own party warned were political in nature. The Senate dismissed the charges on the basis that they did not”allege conduct that rises to the level of a high crime or misdemeanor”.

Impeachment requires a majority vote in the House to approve the charges, and a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove an official from office.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea2dc5d994c2f52bb659f3f04425bc7b14b600d1/417_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65781cb03df0f40dcc45105b93fdfe5a",N,,2026-01-14 14:57:58.246891

In the Powderhorn neighborhood in Minneapolis, federal agents dispersed pepper balls and flash bangs amid the protests.","A hearing is expected Wednesday in the lawsuit filed by the state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities challenging the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operation there, which the lawsuit calls “a federal invasion.”

The hearing follows the resignation of at least half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota amid pressure from the Trump administration on how to conduct an investigation into the deadly shooting of a woman by an ICE agent last week, a source said.

The killing of Renee Good, a US citizen and mother of three, sparked days of protests in Minneapolis as the Trump administration said it was deploying around 1,000 additional Customs and Border Protection personnel to the region.

Here are the key things to know:

Lawsuit: The Wednesday court hearing involves the Minnesota lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, which is seeking a court order halting immigration enforcement operations. The lawsuit claims Operation Metro Surge is not a legitimate law enforcement action and says the Twin Cities are being targeted because of sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with the federal government during immigration enforcement efforts. In response to the lawsuit, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Constitution was on the administration’s side and the surge of federal officers was needed because politicians in Illinois and Minnesota were not protecting their citizens.

Prosecutors resign: The senior career prosecutors who stepped down reportedly objected to pressure from the White House to shift the investigation into Good’s shooting away from the agent’s use of force and toward Good, her widow, and others connected to immigration protests. Joseph Thompson, who frequently handled investigations with political implications including one into social services fraud, was among those who resigned. Read more about who some of the other prosecutors were here.

No civil rights investigation: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department does not believe there is evidence to back a criminal civil rights investigation into the actions of the ICE agent who shot Good. Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara criticized the move. An FBI investigation of the shooting is ongoing, though local authorities have been blocked from joining the probe.

More federal agents: US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino said “hundreds and hundreds” of additional federal agents are being deployed to Minneapolis. The agents started deploying Friday and continued over the weekend, according to two federal law enforcement sources. This comes on top of the deployment of about 2,000 agents to the area that CNN reportedearlier.

White House reaction: Trump on Tuesday defended ICE agents operating in Minnesota, calling them “patriots” and warning online that a “day of reckoning and retribution is coming,” as the administration sends more federal agents to Minneapolis.

Federal funding: During a speech Tuesday, President Donald Trump announced the federal government will not make “any payments” to sanctuary cities or states with sanctuary cities starting February 1. A judge blocked the administration from denying funding to over 30 cities last year for policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Protests: A few blocks away from where Renee Good was killed federal officers clashed with protesters Tuesday. Agents smashed one woman’s car window and pulled her out of the vehicle, video showed. In the Powderhorn neighborhood in Minneapolis, federal agents dispersed pepper balls and flash bangs amid the protests. Outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, protesters chanted, waved signs and flags, and confronted federal agents parked at the gate, at times stepping into the street to try to block vehicles they believed were carrying ICE officers.

Somali community targeted: The Trump administration sharpened it’s focus on Minneapolis after allegations of widespread fraud at Somali-run child care centers in the area were raised in a video posted by a conservative YouTuber last month, with little evidence. On Tuesday, DHS said it will terminate humanitarian relief for Somali nationals living in the US, arguing conditions in Somalia no longer justify those protections. The termination of the relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, drew swift backlash from Minnesota leaders, who said they were not consulted and warn the decision, combined with the president’s escalating rhetoric and stepped‑up enforcement is fueling fear in the Somali community and could affect people with legal status and no criminal records.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26014061838437-1.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 12:58:29.503774

At least six federal prosecutors in Minnesota have quit.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

The six have one big reason - Justice Department officials pressured them to twist the investigation of a shooting in Minneapolis. Rather than focus on the federal agent who shot Renee Macklin Good in the head, political leaders wanted an investigation to find dirt on Good's widow. The resignations have disrupted other federal probes, such as an investigation of Social Service fraud the Trump administration says it cares about.

MARTÍNEZ: Minnesota Public Radio's Matt Sepic has been covering both the fraud cases and the shooting death. Matt, why did the six attorneys resign?

MATT SEPIC, BYLINE: The attorneys aren't speaking publicly, but there are several reasons, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. That person asked that we use their name because they're not authorized to talk to the media. One of those reasons is tied to last week's fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Macklin Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Trump administration officials say the agent fired in self-defense, but many state and local officials are pointing to video taken from multiple angles that contradicts claims that Good posed any threat.

The person with knowledge of the situation I spoke with says there's pressure from DOJ leaders to investigate Good's widow, Becca Good, for ties to activist groups, which is not illegal. The group also objects to the DOJ's reluctance to investigate Agent Ross and to exclude state police from the investigation. And the same source tells me that the veteran prosecutors are concerned that Trump's focus on immigration has drawn resources away from the fraud investigations.

MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. You mentioned they're veteran prosecutors - been around a while. What's significant about their decision?

SEPIC: Well, it's a loss of big talent. The attorneys spent their careers with the Justice Department and prosecuted many major cases. One of them is Melinda Williams, an assistant U.S. attorney who led the criminal division here. Another is Joe Thompson. He's been key in the government's prosecution of fraud, particularly the infamous Feeding Our Future case. Thompson charged 78 people with stealing around $300 million from federal child nutrition programs during the pandemic. Fifty-eight have been convicted. Investigators also uncovered massive Medicaid fraud. Last month, Thompson estimated that around $9 billion may have been stolen.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOE THOMPSON: Taxpayers deserve to know the truth of the fraud. The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated.

SEPIC: The convicted food fraud ring leader is white, but nearly all of the other defendants are Somali American. Even though the majority are U.S. citizens, President Trump is using the fraud as a pretext for his immigration crackdown.

MARTÍNEZ: I would imagine leaders in Minnesota have a lot to say about these resignations.

SEPIC: Yeah, they do. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, is calling the prosecutors heroes. In a statement, he adds, quote, ""the people pushing to prosecute Renee's widow are monsters."" And U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, also a Democrat and a former prosecutor herself, says DOJ is politicizing the investigation into Good's killing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

AMY KLOBUCHAR: The first way they did it was cutting out the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. That was such a bad sign that there was more bad to come because our Minnesota bureau has seasoned professionals. They've always worked together, and they cut them out.

MARTÍNEZ: What about the Justice Department, Matt? What are they saying?

SEPIC: Assistant Attorney General Todd Blanche says in a short statement, quote, ""there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation."" The DOJ tells me ICE is running its own investigation that's parallel to, quote, ""any FBI investigation."" But the same source, not authorized to speak on the record, calls that a lie and says ICE is not investigating the shooting.

MARTÍNEZ: That's Matt Sepic of Minnesota Public Radio. Thanks.

SEPIC: You're welcome.

The post follows his Tuesday speech at the Detroit Economic Club when he said sanctuary cities “do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.” Sanctuary jurisdictions often limit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

“EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY FIRST, NO MORE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO STATES FOR THEIR CORRUPT CRIMINAL PROTECTION CENTERS KNOWN AS SANCTUARY CITIES,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.

“ALL THEY DO IS BREED CRIME AND VIOLENCE! If States want them, they will have to pay for them! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!” he added.

The post follows his Tuesday speech at the Detroit Economic Club when he said sanctuary cities “do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens.”

Sanctuary jurisdictions often limit local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Some also provide social benefits to immigrants lacking legal status.

In August, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to 32 sanctuary jurisdictions deemed noncompliant with federal immigration laws. The list of states included California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

She urged them to comply with the administration’s immigration enforcement efforts or lose funding, citing an executive order signed by Trump in April.

The order directs Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “identify appropriate Federal funds to sanctuary jurisdictions, including grants and contracts, for suspension or termination, as appropriate.”

The latest move comes after a federal judge ruled the executive order, which would have paused funding for more than 30 sanctuary cities, was likely unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge William Orrick, who was appointed by former President Obama, extended his preliminary injunction in August after the administration did little to object to the original order.

Orrick also barred officials from imposing conditions on grant programs that provide funding “for a variety of critical needs.”

Still, the Department of Homeland Security ramped up pressure by publicly listing more than 500 “sanctuary jurisdictions,” including cities, counties and states, arguing they put American lives at risk by obstructing immigration enforcement.

The president’s crackdown on illegal immigration has also sparked protests across the U.S. Most recently, the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer last week and another shooting by Border Patrol agents in Portland, Ore., have fanned the flames.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26013662920667_5952cf-e1768333619342.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:04.982926

What could be further from that than masked agents roaming American streets in packs, refusing to identify themselves, and terrorizing—there is no other word for it at this point—American citizens?

Early on, the excuse for wearing masks was that it was necessary to protect the agents. From what? There were reports that they were being doxxed, which no one in law enforcement likes to deal with. But they’re the ones assaulting and killing people, which is far more problematic.

You don’t routinely see the FBI or U.S. Marshals out doing their jobs with masks on. There is literally no legitimate reason for ICE and Customs Border Patrol (CBP) to continue to operate this way during immigration “enforcement actions,” especially in light of the recent history of documented abuses. Anonymity accelerates that kind of behavior. It tells the agents they aren’t accountable for violating people’s civil rights.

The overwhelming majority of federal law enforcement agents I worked with during my 25-year career at DOJ were men and women who were committed to following the law themselves while protecting their communities and prosecuting crimes. They believed citizens had constitutional rights. There’s no reason for the sudden change, a world where an agent shoots and kills a woman for no good reason, except that the current leadership in the White House and at DHS is willing to tolerate, if not encourage, what we’re now seeing. There are people ripped out of their cars, homes entered without a judicial warrant, agents who treat American citizens like they have no rights. This administration dishonors the service of the federal agents who spent their careers committed to constitutional policing.

Law enforcement officers are trained to de-escalate tense situations. Instead, we’re watching ICE agents act like the accelerant to a smoldering fire. The administration’s take on the failure of agents to behave like the good guys they’re supposed to be isn’t to put a stop to it. Instead, they revel in the Gestapo-like images of doors being busted down, school kids being knocked to the ground, and peaceful protesters being hit with pepper spray. So, it’s up to someone else to stop it.

The state of training at ICE is unclear, as new agents are rapidly hired and deployed. But what we’re seeing is troubling.

Some states have tried passing laws to prohibit masking.

California passed SB 627 (the “No Secret Police Act”) in late 2025, restricting law enforcement, including federal agents, from using extreme face coverings like ski masks during operations, effective Jan 1, 2026. There are logical exemptions to protect officer safety and the identity of undercover operatives. California Governor Gavin Newsom said at the time, “This is about the secret police. We're not North Korea, Mr. President. We're not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America.”

The language of the bill explains that “facial coverings limit the visibility of facial expressions, which are essential components of nonverbal communication. In high-stress or emotionally charged interactions, the inability to read an officer’s expression may lead to misinterpretation of tone or intent, increasing the risk of conflict escalation” and that “the visibility of an officer’s face is vital for promoting transparency, facilitating communication, and building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve.” It also points out that “when officers are not readily identifiable, it increases the risk of impersonation by unauthorized individuals, which further undermines public trust, endangers public safety, and hinders legitimate law enforcement operations.”

But the Constitution protects federal supremacy, and the predictable challenge to the law from DOJ ensued in November 2025, arguing that the measure infringes on federal authority and endangers agent safety in an environment of accelerating threats made against them. California agreed it would not enforce the law until a judge had the opportunity to rule on the federal government’s request for a preliminary injunction. The concession was viewed as “a tactical decision by the state, speeding the court proceedings toward a conclusion while avoiding a temporary restraining order that likely would have prevented the law from taking effect in the meantime.” A preliminary injunction hearing is scheduled to take place this week.

Other states and localities are working with similar measures, including Denver, New Jersey, and New York. Congress could get into the act, too, avoiding the Supremacy Clause issue. California Representative Eric Swalwell has suggested it could be possible, for instance, to deny agents who are inappropriately masked the benefits of qualified immunity if they engage in misconduct. Greg Sargent detailed his conversation with Swalwell in a series of tweets. Other Democratic representatives have suggested on social media that they, too, would support such a move, but it remains to be seen whether it can gain any traction with Republicans.

Law enforcement can adapt to measures that prohibit masking except when necessary (as in SWAT operations or for undercover agents). Although federal law doesn’t contain any restrictions on wearing masks, in 2022, the Secret Service and the Park Police agreed to wear badges and identify themselves in public, as a result of the debacle in Lafayette Square during the first Trump administration, when rubber bullets, tear gas, and flash bangs were used on peaceful protestors. Federal agents and police cleared the Square to facilitate Trump’s desire for a photo opportunity at St. John’s Church.

Whether or not the California law passes constitutional muster, its rationale is strong. In a moment where the focus should be on de-escalating tension between federal agents and communities, masks are making it worse. It would be a simple measure and a show of good faith toward communities like Minneapolis to end their use. That the administration won’t take even that simple step tells you all you need to know about where this is headed.

“Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty.” Details about the circumstances that led to their detention were unclear.

“It’s kind of like a continuation on the monopoly of violence from the military outpost to the ICE facility.” It's not the first time in recent months that ICE agents have detained tribal members.","The president of Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota on Tuesday called for the immediate release of tribal members who were detained at a homeless encampment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minnesota last week.

Three of the four Oglala Sioux Tribe members who were arrested in Minneapolis on Friday have been transferred to an ICE facility at Fort Snelling, President Frank Star Comes Out said in a statement released with a memorandum sent to federal immigration authorities.

“The Oglala Sioux Tribe's memorandum makes clear that ‘tribal citizens are not aliens’ and are ‘categorically outside immigration jurisdiction,’” Star Comes Out said. “Enrolled tribal members are citizens of the United States by statute and citizens of the Oglala Sioux Nation by treaty.”

Details about the circumstances that led to their detention were unclear.

In the memorandum sent to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Star Comes Out said the when tribal nation reached out to the agency it was provided with only the first names of the men. Homeland Security refused to release more information, unless the tribe “entered into an immigration agreement with ICE.”

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday evening.

Star Comes Out said the tribe has no plans enter an agreement with ICE.

In a post to his Facebook page, Star Comes Out said that the four detained tribal members are experiencing homelessness and living under a bridge in Minneapolis. One of the members was released from detention.

In the press release, he demanded information on the status of the three men in detention, the release of all tribal citizens in ICE custody and a meeting between the tribe and the government.

Fort Snelling has a troubling history for Indigenous people. It was the first military outpost in the area, and Dakota people were held prisoner there during the Dakota War of 1862, an armed conflict between the U.S. and Native Americans, said Nick Estes, an associate professor in American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota and a member of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe.

“It has this really notorious anti-Indigenous, specifically anti-Dakota, history,” Estes said. “It’s kind of like a continuation on the monopoly of violence from the military outpost to the ICE facility.”

It's not the first time in recent months that ICE agents have detained tribal members.

Last year, elected leaders in the Navajo Nation said that tribal citizens in Arizona and New Mexico reported being stopped and detained by ICE officers. In November, a member of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona who had been arrested in Iowa was mistakenly scheduled to be deported before the error was caught and she was released.

That same month, Elaine Miles, a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon and an actress known for her roles in “Northern Exposure” and “The Last of Us,” said she was stopped by ICE officers in Washington state who told her that her tribal ID looked fake.

Indigenous rights groups as well as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians have established places in Minneapolis where tribal citizens can apply for tribal ID cards, in case they are approached by ICE and need to provide identification.

“I never thought that I’d have my tribal ID hanging around my neck, but I do,” said Mary LaGarde, executive director of the Minneapolis American Indian Center. “So, it’s just important that they have proper identification on them and not to panic.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a75f3f9e-257a-4036-af1e-d3dd70607921/wirestory_29ac43de85569b80bd64875388097ab6_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-14 12:58:25.362892

The same story is playing out at other parishes in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis since ICE's ""Operation Metro Surge"" began in December.","In the days following the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good by a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis, there has been an upwelling of community prayer and support for people targeted by the government's immigration crackdown surge.

Hours after the shooting, a crowd of thousands gathered around the site to remember Good and protest the ICE action that took her life. Thousands more have gathered at other events since then, including an ""ICE out of Minnesota"" march hosted by the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee on Jan. 10.

Anne Attea, a longtime parishioner at Church of the Ascension in North Minneapolis, attended a ""Vigil of Hope"" at the state capitol Jan. 9. She said many in the Spanish-speaking immigrant community at her parish experienced what she described as an ""Advent of darkness"" as the ICE crackdown in the city began. Both documented and undocumented immigrants have been living in fear, she said, because ICE agents have been engaged in aggressive racial and ethnic profiling.

""We as a Catholic body should become more forceful in denouncing hate, evil, racism and lack of respect for human dignity,"" said Attea, who is program minister in the Center for Spirituality & Social Justice at St. Catherine University in St. Paul.

About 400 people prayed Jan. 13 outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis where people are being detained by ICE. Participants held signs denouncing ICE and remembering Good.

""I think solidarity in times like this is so important,"" said Aaron Sinner, a parishioner at St. Thomas More Catholic Church in St. Paul. ""ICE has a pretty clear mandate, and it's a pretty narrow mandate by law. It's scary to see the wanton disregard for what their scope of duty is and the reckless abandon with which they are exceeding their mandate and putting lives at risk.""

Marty Roers, of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet Justice Office in St. Paul, belongs to an interfaith group that has been showing up to pray at the federal immigration detention facility every month for 12 years. On Jan. 13 he said he was there ""standing up for a better way to work with the issues and struggles of immigration.""

The ICE agents in the Minneapolis area in recent weeks wearing black head coverings have reminded Houa Her, a parishioner at Presentation of Mary Parish in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood, of the Communist military forces that came to his village in Laos. They questioned people about their activities and loyalties and took some away, never to return, he said.

People were living in fear, he told The National Catholic Reporter. Her was 12 years old at the time. He eventually came to the U.S. with his brother from a refugee camp in Thailand and has been a U.S. citizen since 1995.

Currently in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, ICE agents have not limited their actions to city streets. They have also entered people's homes and, in doing so, have created a sense of fear that is disrupting family life, according to a Latino parish ministry worker in the archdiocese who did not want her name to be used out of safety concerns. She described a feeling of great desolation in the community.

""These (people) are not threats to our community,"" said Fr. Dale Korogi, pastor of Ascension Church, in remarks about immigrants at an interfaith press conference in Minneapolis Jan. 8. ""These are really good people!"" The priest said that families were afraid to leave their homes. They're not being inconvenienced by ICE, he said, they're being harassed, terrorized and traumatized by ICE. In the memory of Renee Good and in the name of God, Karogi called for an end to this cruelty.

Korogi said Mass attendance among Spanish-speakers at Ascension is down about 80%. Fear of leaving home has also contributed to an over 60% drop in attendance numbers at the Sunday afternoon Spanish-language Mass at Assumption Catholic Church in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, another parish with a large Spanish-speaking immigrant congregation. The same story is playing out at other parishes in the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis since ICE's ""Operation Metro Surge"" began in December.

""Currently in Minneapolis we see so much inhumanity,"" said one South Minneapolis pastor in his weekend homily. ""Whatever our nationality or race, our true citizenship is in the Kingdom of God. Let's live that way,"" said the priest who didn't want to be identified out of concern for his parishioners' safety.

""When it comes to ICE operations, I understand they are doing their job,"" said Digna Yaurincela, a parishioner at St. Richards Catholic Church in Richfield, ""but they're focusing on the wrong people.""

Yaurincela, who is a U.S. citizen, related several accounts of people being picked up by ICE agents. They included a 17-year old who was picked up at the Richfield Target store, then released 3 miles away at the Bloomington Walmart after producing a passport to establish his U.S. citizenship. She worries her own children might be picked up based simply on how they look.

""We're human beings, people with children trying to provide for our families,"" Yaurincela said.

“Our caucus will oppose all funding for immigration enforcement in any appropriations bills until meaningful reforms are enacted to end militarized policing practices,” Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents Minneapolis, said during a press conference.

Last week, federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis, which has seen a drastic increase in immigration enforcement for weeks following allegations of fraud. After the shooting, massive protests against the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement occurred in Minnesota and across the country.

The U.S. Senate is moving forward with the remaining appropriations bills for Congress to avoid a partial shutdown by a Jan. 30 deadline, and negotiations continue over funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement is “one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said the appropriations bill for “Homeland is obviously the hardest one,” and that flat funding, or a continuing resolution, for the agency is the likely outcome.

Members of the Progressive Caucus are pushing for reforms including a ban on federal immigration officers wearing face coverings, the requirement of a warrant for an arrest and greater oversight of private detention facilities that hold immigrants.

Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Congress also needs to pass legislation to roll back the billions allocated to the Department of Homeland Security last summer in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The massive GOP spending and tax cuts package provided a huge budget increase to DHS for immigration enforcement of roughly $175 billion.

“We have to urgently pass legislation to roll back the excessive funding for immigration enforcement” in the spending and tax cuts package, Jayapal said. “We cannot support additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security without seriously meaningful and significant reforms to the way that federal authorities conduct activity in our cities, our communities and our neighborhoods.”

Progressives press Jeffries

The Progressive Caucus has nearly 100 Democratic House members. Those members joining the press conference included Omar, Jayapal, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Chuy Garcia of Illinois, Delia Ramirez of Illinois and Dexter of Oregon.

Garcia, who is the whip of the Progressive Caucus, said the group has informed House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of their position, but did not say if Jeffries supported slashing DHS funds.

“They are very concerned, and they also share our sentiment that we need to do something to bring reform, to bring change to stop the lawlessness, the cruelty and the abuse of power that’s taking place within ICE and (Customs and Border Patrol) and DHS,” he said of Democratic leadership.

While Democrats do not control either chamber, one tool lawmakers have used amid the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration campaign is the power of congressional oversight of federal facilities that house immigrants and are funded by Congress.

But following the shooting in Minnesota, several lawmakers were denied an oversight visit to a federal ICE facility, a move that Democrats argue violates a court order.

There will be an emergency hearing in the District Court for the District of Columbia on Wednesday on a new Trump administration policy that argues those facilities are funded through the spending and tax cuts package and therefore exempt from unannounced oversight visits.

Jayapal called the reasoning “a B.S. argument, and hopefully the court is going to see that.”

Investigations urged

Jayapal added that there also needs to be “independent investigations of lawlessness and violence by immigration agents and border patrol agents, and meaningful consequences for those who commit these acts of violence, not a slap on the wrist.”

Dexter, who represents part of Portland, Oregon, where two people were shot by CBP the same week Good was shot and killed, agreed.

“One thing is absolutely clear, when any law enforcement officer fires a weapon in any community, the public must have answers to questions,” Dexter said.

Ramirez said there needs to be greater accountability beyond appropriations, and said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be impeached.

Illinois Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly is planning to introduce articles of impeachment for Noem on three counts: obstructing Congress, violating public trust and self-dealing. While such a move likely would be uphill in the House, Republicans at the moment control the chamber by a very narrow margin.

“DHS and ICE have been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate our rights under the pretense of security and safety,” Ramirez said.

Frost said that Congress needs to assert its control over appropriations as a check against the Trump administration.

“We cannot depend on this administration to police themselves and an end to the enforcement practices that are terrorizing our communities,” Frost said.",https://portlandtribune.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2026/01/Rep.-Ilhan-Omar-a-Minnesota-Democrat-speaks-at-a-press-conference-with-members-of-the-Congress.jpg?w=648,N,,2026-01-14 13:59:08.731906

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.
Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.
Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.
“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) – The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

While an FBI probe is ongoing, lawyers in the Civil Rights Division were informed last week that they would not play a role in the investigation at this time, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department deliberations.

And on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” The statement, first reported by CNN, did not elaborate on how the department had reached a conclusion that no investigation was warranted.

Federal officials have said that the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled forward toward him.

Also this week, roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division in Washington gave notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday, days after lawyers were told the section would not be involved in the probe. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings by law enforcement even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration. “And historically the federal government has played an important role by being a neutral and impartial agency committing its resources to conducting a full and fair investigation, and the public loses out when that doesn’t happen,” she said.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-shooting-minneapolis-01-07-26.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:59:05.435992

Some people wondered if Ms. Good’s death would lead to a broader reckoning by organizers about the risks of confronting ICE agents, and the safety of pursuing them in cars.
But group chats on WhatsApp have proliferated, as neighbors watched for signs of immigration agents and rushed outside to confront them.
“Because of what happened to Renee, I felt like we had nothing to lose anymore,” said Ms. Lopez, who has joined patrols that blow whistles and set off their own car alarms if they see ICE agents.
“When they release tear gas in a neighborhood, it doesn’t matter if you support ICE or not.","It began in Los Angeles, in Signal chats and strategy sessions on Zoom. Last year, as immigration raids proliferated throughout the city, Latino activists and neighbors began organizing a response, monitoring for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents along sidewalks and in Home Depot parking lots and texting their networks when they spotted an arrest underway.

By late summer, activists in Chicago were trained and ready. Before the Trump administration had announced a crackdown called Operation Midway Blitz, immigrant rights organizations had handed out orange whistles for volunteers to use as a public warning system, formed “rapid-response” groups and advised people to report sightings of ICE agents and memorize their own legal rights. Chicagoans, even many without formal ties to protest groups, showed defiance against ICE with “Hands Off Chicago” signs adorned with the city’s beloved starred-and-striped flag, placed prominently in windows of restaurants and bungalows.

And in recent weeks in Minneapolis, the latest focus for a Trump administration surge of immigration enforcement, a loose but growing network of neighborhood volunteers has shown up near reported arrests, yelling at agents and recording them on iPhone cameras. Some gathered near hotels where agents were believed to be staying, pounding drums and making noise.

President Trump’s sweeping effort to tamp down illegal immigration, using masked federal agents who film their interactions with cellphones and often question American citizens about their legal status, has set off a surge in confrontational activism fueled by both large liberal advocacy groups and hyperlocal neighborhood networks.

Participants say they have been propelled into action with two goals in mind: an urge to protect their neighbors, many of whom are in the country without authorization but have no criminal backgrounds, and also to push back against what they see as a violent and overreaching federal government.

“It’s a lot of people who wouldn’t normally involve themselves in politics, but at the same time don’t like what’s happening in their community,” said Sandra Trevino, a Chicago resident who works in sales but spends her weekends patrolling the city for immigration agents and texting her networks with updates.

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, has called the actions of such activists dangerous, part of “a coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement.”

In Minnesota, where an ICE agent fatally shot a 37-year-old woman, Renee Nicole Good, last week, tensions have mounted since an immigration crackdown began there in early December. Some Minnesota residents have thrown icy snowballs or other objects at agents, called them Nazis and fascists and trailed them in their cars, honking their horns, a practice frequently used in Chicago last year.

“Secretary Noem has been clear: Anyone who obstructs or assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” the department said in a statement on Tuesday.

It is not yet clear how deeply the Goods were connected to anti-ICE efforts in Minneapolis. Becca Good was wearing an orange whistle around her neck as she confronted federal agents while filming them with her cellphone, videos show, moments before Renee Good was fatally shot in her car.

In a statement issued to Minnesota Public Radio, Becca Good suggested that the two women had taken part in a protest on the day of the shooting, but their involvement beyond that day is unknown.

“On Wednesday, Jan. 7, we stopped to support our neighbors,” Becca Good said. “We had whistles. They had guns.”

Anti-ICE tactics by volunteers and so-called patrollers who track and follow immigration agents in caravans have only intensified in the Twin Cities in the last week, despite Ms. Good’s death, activists and officials said in interviews.

Some people wondered if Ms. Good’s death would lead to a broader reckoning by organizers about the risks of confronting ICE agents, and the safety of pursuing them in cars. But group chats on WhatsApp have proliferated, as neighbors watched for signs of immigration agents and rushed outside to confront them.

Ashley Lopez, who works in education and lives in the city of West St. Paul, has become active in anti-ICE neighborhood groups only in the week since Ms. Good’s death.

“Because of what happened to Renee, I felt like we had nothing to lose anymore,” said Ms. Lopez, who has joined patrols that blow whistles and set off their own car alarms if they see ICE agents. “Why should she be the only one who put herself in danger?”

Dieu Do, an immigrant rights activist, said that before the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, her organization received dozens of emails a day from people asking how they could get involved. That has now grown to hundreds daily.

“People are still showing up and defending their community despite seeing such a violent act,” she said. “They’re calling for justice, even though there is a chance they could be hurt in the process.”

Patrollers in Chicago said this week that they were still roaming around the city looking for ICE agents. But many of their Signal chats and Facebook groups have gone quiet, a sign that the Trump administration’s focus has shifted squarely to Minneapolis — at least for now.

That feels far different from how it did in Chicago last fall, when masked federal agents walked down the Magnificent Mile downtown, startling residents and tourists. As residents began protesting their presence in neighborhoods, agents used aggressive methods to disperse crowds, releasing tear gas and pepper spray along blocks around the city.

“In a way, it really galvanized local support against them everywhere they went,” said Brandon Lee, a coordinator for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “When they release tear gas in a neighborhood, it doesn’t matter if you support ICE or not. You’re going to get tear-gassed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/14/multimedia/14nat-ice-activists-1-kwgp/14nat-ice-activists-1-kwgp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 10:58:37.074702

Now they're turning on his economy. - POLITICO,"Samuel Benson, Alec Hernandez",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/14/latino-voters-powered-trumps-comeback-now-theyre-turning-on-his-economy-00726548,"From lowering inflation to creating a housing plan, President Trump is fighting for the working families Democrats left behind,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.
But polling shows Trump’s approval among Latino voters cratering as their satisfaction with the economy and immigration enforcement plummet.
Those elections are a referendum on Trump’s economy, said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist and adviser to newly-elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins’ campaign.
Palomarez, the U.S. Hispanic Business Council president, compared it to the Biden administration’s insistence that the post-Covid economy was healthy, even as consumer sentiment plunged.
“It sends a really negative message to the 48 percent of Hispanic voters that voted for President Trump,” Sanchez said.","“The broader Hispanic community certainly feels let down,” said Javier Palomarez, the organization’s president and CEO. “It would be different if immigration and the economy had not been principal talking points for [Trump]. On both fronts, we didn’t get what we thought we were going to get.”

The combination of ongoing economic uncertainty and stubbornly high prices driven by Trump’s tariffs — coupled with the economic impact of the Trump administration’s ongoing raids in immigrant-heavy communities — makes the situation increasingly dire for some Hispanic business owners.

Trump and his allies argue that they’re just cleaning up the mess left by the previous president.

“Republicans are putting in the work to fix the Bidenflation mess we inherited. From lowering inflation to creating a housing plan, President Trump is fighting for the working families Democrats left behind,” said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Delanie Bomar.

Monica Villalobos, president and CEO of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told POLITICO about a South Phoenix restaurant hit hard by tariffs and labor shortages. Then, a series of ICE raids in the parking lot in front of the restaurant caused customers and workers to stop showing up and forced the owners to shut it down for several days. She predicted this kind of situation will blow back on Republicans in the next election.

“We certainly do sense that our members — our clients in Arizona and across the country — feel a sense of betrayal by this administration, given its excessive overreach,” Villalobos said. “Now that we’ve had a taste of [the Trump administration], I think you’re going to see a big shift [in the vote].”

In 2024, Trump won 48 percent of self-described Hispanic or Latino voters, the highest mark for a Republican presidential candidate in at least a half-century, driven largely by economic anxiety. But polling shows Trump’s approval among Latino voters cratering as their satisfaction with the economy and immigration enforcement plummet.

In a November POLITICO Poll, a plurality — 48 percent — of Hispanic respondents said the cost of living in the U.S. is “the worst I can ever remember it being,” and a majority (67 percent) said responsibility lies with the president to fix it.

According to a November Pew Research poll, about two-thirds (68 percent) of U.S. Hispanics say their situation today is worse than it was a year ago, and just nine percent say it is better; 65 percent of Latinos disagree with this administration’s approach to immigration, and a majority (52 percent) said they worried they, a family member or a close friend could be deported, a ten-point increase since March.

Trump’s net favorability rating among Hispanics is now at 28 percent, per a recent The Economist/YouGov poll, 13 points lower than it was in February of last year.

“Small business owners are becoming a swing constituency, when you think about the midterms coming up,” said Tayde Aburto, president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of E-Commerce. “And not because their values have changed—it’s just because their costs did.”

Latino voters have swung hard back toward Democrats in recent elections as well. In Passaic County, New Jersey, Latinos voted narrowly for Trump in 2024 but in November backed Democratic Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill by double digits. And in Miami, where over 70 percent of residents are Hispanic, a Democratic mayor was elected last month for the first time in 28 years last month.

Those elections are a referendum on Trump’s economy, said Christian Ulvert, a Democratic strategist and adviser to newly-elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins’ campaign.

“[Trump’s] agenda literally does little to nothing to help Hispanic families,” Ulvert said. “Worse, it preys on Hispanic families. And what we heard on the campaign trail most pointedly is the old adage: is my life better today than it was yesterday under new leaders? And resoundingly, not only verbally, but through the ballot box throughout the year, Hispanic families are saying, ‘no, my life is actually worse.’”

Joe Vichot, the Republican Party chair in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, said he knows many Hispanic Republicans in Allentown who are supportive of curbing illegal immigration and fighting crime. “But there’s also stories of people who have been here for 10 years or more with their family, but they’ve never been legal, that are now caught up into the [deportation] system,” he said.

“There should be a way to find some type of common ground where that won’t happen.”

The White House has tried to ease the ailing economic sentiment by sending Trump and Vice President JD Vance on the road, delivering a series of stump speeches on affordability in working-class areas, including Vance’s Dec. 16 stop in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, which includes the Hispanic-majority city of Allentown. They insist the economy deserves an “A+++” grade, and are now buoyed by a December consumer price index report released Tuesday that showed inflation rising at a slower pace than expected.

“Joe Biden gave us a colossal catastrophe, but my administration has rapidly and very decisively ended that,” Trump said during a speech in Detroit Tuesday. “We have quickly achieved the exact opposite of stagflation — almost no inflation and super high growth.”

But cooling inflation rates just mean prices aren’t rising as fast as they had been — prices still remain much higher on many goods than they had been in recent years. And improving macroeconomic trends are not yet being felt by consumers, said Massey Villarreal, a business executive in Houston.

“I’m like most Americans. I hear the inflation number and I don’t translate it to my going to the grocery store, when I look at the cost of hamburger meat,” said Villarreal, a former chair of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly.

Palomarez, the U.S. Hispanic Business Council president, compared it to the Biden administration’s insistence that the post-Covid economy was healthy, even as consumer sentiment plunged. “While we were talking about GDP and unemployment and jobs growth rates, people were worried about the rent and the price of gas and the price of eggs. And we’ve got kind of the same thing here,” he said.

In Chicago, where some of the most-publicized immigration enforcement occurred last year, Hispanic-run businesses have been hit hard. Sam Sanchez, CEO of Third Coast Hospitality, said 2025 was the hardest period for business of his four decades in restauranteering, aside from the COVID pandemic.

“It sends a really negative message to the 48 percent of Hispanic voters that voted for President Trump,” Sanchez said. “Everything’s just starting to fall apart.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F11%2F74%2F1b0726414d549e42ba7e117b7668%2F201101-trump-az-ap-773.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 11:58:52.340179

Southside, an elementary school that was founded in 1972, had 111 students enrolled last year, according to a school board document.","The woman killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis last week served on the board of her son’s school, which linked to documents encouraging parents to monitor ICE and directing them to training.

The documents shed new light on Renee Good’s connection to efforts to monitor and potentially disrupt ICE operations – an association that federal officials have made clear is at the center of their review into the deadly incident that occurred as she partially blocked ICE agents in the street with her SUV.

But four legal experts who reviewed the documents for CNN said they largely describe nonviolent civil disobedience tactics practiced at American protests for generations – far from the sinister depiction of extremism and domestic terrorism portrayed by Trump administration officials like Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Vice President JD Vance.

“There’s nothing in there that suggests attacking ICE agents or engaging in any other form of physical harm or property damage,” said Timothy Zick, a professor at William and Mary Law School who wrote a book on protest law. “This is authoritarianism 101 where you blame the dissenters and the activists for causing their own death.”

At least six federal prosecutors in Minneapolis resigned Tuesday over pressure from the Trump administration to focus their probe on the actions of Good and those around her, according to a person briefed on the matter.

One of the documents linked by the school appears to be a message to parents dated December 16 that begins, “Thank you to families who have been on ICE watch, helping to protect their neighbors.”

The note links to a separate training document with guides on getting whistles to alert neighbors to ICE raids and contact information for a school parent offering “noncooperation training.”

“ICE are untrained bullies looking for easy targets. Neighbors showing up have saved lives,” that training document reads.

Another guide linked to in the training document stresses nonviolent responses to ICE agents, while also encouraging a refusal to “comply with demands, requests, and orders.” It suggests “creative tactics,” noting that “Crowds, props, traffic, and noise can make detentions difficult, sometimes ICE vehicles can’t move (‘whoops!’).” It does not specifically suggest blocking operations with a vehicle.

The December 16 note, titled “School Report,” was an item on the school board’s meeting on that date, an agenda shows – a meeting that Good attended as one of three parents on the board of the Southside Family Charter School.

Records don’t indicate that the board voted on the message. It’s unclear whether it was more widely shared with families at Southside, a small charter school with a long history of progressive activism. Neither the school nor other board members who served with Good responded to messages from CNN.

Two sources familiar with the school said the “School Report” message appeared similar to past newsletters shared with parents, but neither was on the email list at the time to confirm if it was sent out.

The “School Report” message was uploaded to the school’s public Google Drive about two weeks into the federal operation ramping up immigration enforcement actions in the Minneapolis area, which federal officials had launched to target the region’s Somali community.

Good was partially blocking a street with her SUV on Wednesday as ICE agents operated in the area. An ICE officer who was filming Good shot her after she started to accelerate her SUV. Videos of the deadly interaction show that Good was turning her vehicle away from the agent as she pulled forward, but it’s unclear whether she made contact with him before he fired.

Federal officials have claimed without providing evidence that Good was engaging in “domestic terrorism” and had been “stalking agents all day long,” while some state and local lawmakers have decried that rhetoric as false and incendiary.

Good’s family members have said that she and her wife had come from dropping off their son earlier that morning at Southside, about a mile and a half from where Good was shot.

Good’s wife, Becca Good, said in a statement last week that the couple had “stopped to support our neighbors,” adding, “We had whistles. They had guns.”

Legal experts who spoke to CNN said it was troubling that federal officials appeared to be focusing on low-level violations by protesters instead of the shooting of Good itself.

Gregory Magarian, a professor and First Amendment expert at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, said that the noncooperation tactics described in the guide could potentially violate some laws depending on the context of the situation. But overall, he said, the document endorsed standard nonviolent protest actions that don’t merit an investigation by federal law enforcement.

“If the FBI has an inkling of investigating the protest organizers, it should read that and say, ‘OK, there’s not a fruitful path of inquiry here. Nothing about that raises red flags, nothing about that raises alarms, we should get back to doing our job,’” Magarian said. The idea that the agency would investigate protesters instead of the use of deadly force is “appalling and really dangerous,” he added.

Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, added that attempts to investigate activists and protesters appear to have “the goal of trying to justify the officer’s conduct.”

Good joined the Southside school board in August 2025, a few months after she moved to Minneapolis with her wife and six-year-old son, according to board meeting notes. Her leadership role at the school has not been previously reported.

Southside, an elementary school that was founded in 1972, had 111 students enrolled last year, according to a school board document. It offers programming like student trips to the South to study the history of the Civil Rights Movement and “hands-on experience planting and harvesting” as part of a curriculum on environmental issues.

“The heart of the school’s mission, social justice education, is woven into every subject and grade level,” an annual report read. “By addressing social justice issues at an early age, the school encourages children to see themselves as citizen activists who can change the world and also helps children avoid internalizing the effects of discrimination.”

The documents show that Good was deeply involved with the school community, even as a relatively recent arrival. Good regularly attended board meetings, with records of one meeting noting that “Renee had some questions about the future growth of the school.”

The same school bulletin that encouraged activism to monitor ICE last month also shared how Good and her wife had “brought pots for us to paint” to a school event: “We will sell them at our plant sale in the spring. They look beautiful!”

Rashad Rich, a former physical education teacher at Southside who taught Good’s son in his class, said the couple were familiar faces at the school.

When they dropped off their son, he “would say goodbye several times before they could leave, and then they would drive around the front of the school so they had a window where he could see them,” Rich told CNN. “They’d wave. They were just awesome parents.”

In the wake of Good’s shooting, Rich said, teachers and staff members at the school have had their names and addresses posted on social media.

“They’re getting threats,” he said. “It’s a scary thing right now.”

Donald Trump’s administration said Tuesday it will end Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Somalia, the latest move in the president’s mass deportation agenda.

The move affects hundreds of people who are a small subset of immigrants living in the United States with TPS protections. It comes during Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where many native Somalis live and where street protests have intensified since a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent killed a U.S citizen who was demonstrating against federal presence in the city.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that affected Somalis must leave the U.S. by March 17, when existing protections, last extended by then-President Joe Biden, will expire.

“Temporary means temporary,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, adding that the decision puts “Americans first.”

The Congressional Research Service last spring said the Somali TPS population was 705 out of nearly 1.3 million TPS immigrants. Trump has ended protections across multiple countries in his second presidency.

Homeland Security secretary says conditions in Somalia have changed

Noem insisted circumstances in Somalia “have improved to the point that it no longer meets the law’s requirement for Temporary Protected Status.”

But the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which advocates for fair treatment of Muslims in the U.S., criticized the latest rollback as a “bigoted attack” that will send some Somalis back to a war-torn, unstable nation.

“This decision does not reflect changed conditions in Somalia,” CAIR said in a statement released jointly with its Minnesota chapter. “By dismantling protections for one of the most vulnerable Black and Muslim communities, this decision exposes an agenda rooted in exclusion, not public safety.”

Located in the horn of Africa, Somalia is one of the world’s poorest nations and has for decades been beset by chronic strife exacerbated by multiple natural disasters, including severe droughts. Al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab controls parts of the country and has carried out truck bombings and other assaults in the capital, Mogadishu, in recent years that killed dozens of people.

Congress established the Temporary Protected Status program in 1990 to help foreign nationals who’ve fled unstable, threatening conditions in their home countries and are living in the U.S. It allows the executive branch to designate a country, generally in 18-month increments, for the protected status. Citizens of that country who are already in the U.S. and qualify for protection can apply with Homeland Security for the designation.

If approved, recipients can legally work and are protected from deportation but there is no pathway to a green card or U.S. citizenship and they are reliant on the government renewing the TPS designation every few years.

Critics say that while these designations are supposed to be temporary, they are renewed so often that they essentially become permanent.

Somalia designation traces to the elder Bush’s administration

Somalia first received the designation under President George H.W. Bush amid a civil war in 1991. The status has been extended for decades, most recently by Biden in July 2024.

The 2025 congressional report stated that Somalis had received more than two dozen extensions because of perpetual “insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees.”

Trump has targeted Somali immigrants with racist rhetoric and accused those in Minneapolis of massively defrauding federal programs, charges he renewed again Tuesday speaking in Michigan. He promised, without a clear legal basis, to “revoke the citizenship of any naturalized immigrant from Somalia, or anywhere else who was convicted of defrauding our citizens.”

In December, Trump said he did not want Somalis in the U.S. at all, saying they “come from hell” and “contribute nothing.” He made no distinction between citizens and non-citizens or offered any opinion on immigration status.

Temporary status widened during Joe Biden’s presidency

Biden’s administration broadly expanded the number of people covered by Temporary Protected Status but the Trump administration has steadily sought to strip protections away from various nationalities including 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians. The actions have prompted multiple court challenges but the U.S. Supreme Court has twice issued emergency rulings, last May and again in October, that allowed the Venezuelan revocations to continue as court cases proceed.

It’s not immediately clear how quickly those Somalis covered by TPS could be removed from the country once their protections expire. Most attempts by the administration to end a TPS designation have ended up in the courts. And people covered by TPS can also apply for asylum or other immigration avenues to stay in the U.S., although the Trump administration has made those options more difficult as well for Somalis as well as other nationalities.

The person confirmed the resignations of Joseph Thompson, Melinda Williams and another attorney. The two named attorneys, Thompson and Williams, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment by NBC News.

The attorneys had felt pressure from Justice Department leadership, both in Minneapolis and in Washington, to investigate any ties to activist groups by Good and her widow, said a law enforcement official with knowledge of their decisions. The official said the prosecutors were also concerned about a decision to cut out state and local authorities from the federal investigation.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Thompson was a “principled public servant” who spent more than a decade in law enforcement in the state.

“This is a huge loss for our state,” Walz said of the resignations. “This is the latest sign that President Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the Department of Justice.”

Good was in the driver’s seat of an SUV in a residential part of Minneapolis last week when she was killed.

Video from eyewitnesses shows officers telling Good to get out of her car before she begins driving away. Gunshots can be heard, and the SUV slams into a parked vehicle. Video obtained by NBC News that appears to have been recorded by Jonathan Ross, the officer who shot Good, captured Good and her wife talking to an officer in the moments before he opened fire.

In the video, Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, as she begins to drive.

Ross shouts what sounds like “whoa” and fires, as multiple shots can be heard in the video. The view of his phone camera jerks around, points up to the sky and captures a glimpse of his masked face.

Ross’ phone levels out and captures the SUV accelerating down the street. A male voice said, “f-----g bitch” moments before Good’s car crashes.

The FBI is investigating. But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement Tuesday there was ""currently no basis"" for an investigation by the criminal section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

ICE’s Office of Public Responsibility is conducting its own internal investigation, Blanche said, as is protocol for the agency after every officer-involved shooting. Any investigation runs parallel to the FBI’s investigation into the shooting, a Justice Department official said.

The Department of Homeland Security has said Good, an award-winning poet, “weaponized” her vehicle against the ICE officer who fatally shot her in self-defense.

Local and state officials have disputed that claim, saying Good, 37, was only trying to leave the scene.

Officials in Minnesota have criticized federal authorities for barring the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from participating in the investigation. Asked about the decision last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused state investigators of allowing people to harass and incite violence against federal officers.

The New York Times first reported the resignations.

Thompson, one of the prosecutors who resigned, oversaw a yearslong investigation that resulted in dozens of charges against people accused of defrauding millions of dollars in government funds. The Trump administration cited the fraud investigation when it dispatched ICE officers to Minnesota.

The statement from the governor’s office said Thompson “has worked extensively with state regulators and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to bring federal prosecutions against fraud involving public programs. His work supported oversight, enforcement, and program integrity.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said in a statement about the resignations, “The legitimacy of the justice system depends on institutions — not rhetoric.”

“Joe Thompson is an institution within law enforcement, directly responsible for building and prosecuting the fraud cases now being cited to justify this moment,” he said, referring to allegations of fraud at child care facilities.

“When you lose the leader responsible for making those cases, it signals that this isn’t about prosecuting fraud,” O’Hara said in the statement.

Last week, the Trump administration deployed more than 2,000 officers and agents from ICE and Homeland Security Investigations to Minneapolis after a right-wing influencer accused several Somali-run day care facilities of fraud.

State officials who investigated the allegations said they found no evidence to back up the claims.

Within the main Justice Department in Washington, at least six leaders at the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division were taking early retirement, two people familiar with the matter told NBC News. A third person familiar with the departures said that they were planned before the Minnesota shooting.

The division, which is tasked in part with investigating possible abuse by law enforcement, has lost hundreds of attorneys since President Donald Trump returned to office. MS NOW first reported on the departures.

Kristen Clarke, the former head of the division under President Joe Biden, said the departures would have a major impact.

“The hollowing out of the Civil Rights Division’s national expertise hurts every American,” Clarke said. “Unparalleled expertise and commitment to impartiality is precisely what’s needed in this moment.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260113-minneapolis-ice-car-ew-312p-7dd794.jpg",N,,2026-01-14 10:58:52.002625

“The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve,” the senators wrote in their letter to the Senate Armed Services, Foreign Relations, Judiciary, and Intelligence Committees. “Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct oversight and reassert its role in future decisions regarding Venezuela.”

The senators demanded answers on the President’s legal justification and his plans to “run Venezuela,” including funding the expansion of U.S. oil companies’ in Venezuela as he promised. They also noted that the President’s intervention in Venezuela deviates from decades of U.S. foreign policy and puts American service members in harm’s way.

Previously, Hickenlooper called out President Trump for launching a war in Venezuela without congressional authorization. Hickenlooper also voted to block the use of the U.S. Armed Forces to engage in further hostilities within or against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.

Full text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Shaheen, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Durbin, Chairman Cotton, and Vice Chairman Warner:

We write to urge you to convene immediate public oversight hearings covering President Donald Trump’s January 3, 2026 military operation in Venezuela, which Congress did not authorize. The American people deserve clarity as to why the President put our service members in harm’s way and what his plan is in Venezuela moving forward.

Nicolás Maduro was an illegitimate, brutal leader who lost, and then stole, the country’s 2024 elections. There is also no doubt as to the bravery and skill of the U.S military, law enforcement, and intelligence community personnel who contributed to this operation. However, we have seen no evidence justifying the administration’s initial decision to take military action to oust Maduro – particularly without Congressional authorization or even Congressional notification.

Equally important, with Maduro now in U.S. custody, the administration has provided Congress absolutely no coherent justification for keeping 15,000 U.S. forces and dozens of U.S. military assets in the region. Congress must decide whether we should permit this administration to maintain this military build-up, and assess the broader national security implications of the President’s military intervention in Venezuela.

This is not just a procedural matter, nor an after-action report. The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve, including on the following questions:

This is not just a procedural matter, nor an after-action report. The Trump administration has, thus far, failed to explain its plans for Venezuela’s future, how this misadventure will end, and whether it plans to use the U.S. military to exploit Venezuela’s oil for our own economic purposes. Public hearings would provide the answers the American people deserve, including on the following questions:

1. What are U.S. interests in Venezuela and how do they justify the military actions that President Trump ordered without Congressional authorization? President Trump mentioned oil roughly 20 times in his January 3 press conference. Meanwhile, other senior administration officials justified U.S. actions as necessary to counter illicit narcotics, assert U.S. influence as a “great power” in the Western Hemisphere, access Venezuela’s vast natural resource wealth, and prevent illegal immigration. The American people deserve to understand why the President put our military in harm’s way and may do so again.

2. Under what legal authority did the administration carry out the January 3 operation? The scope of the operation, involving hundreds of U.S. military personnel and planes, is not consistent with a law enforcement operation.

3. How many people were killed in the January 3 operation, and what country or countries were they from? Reports suggest that 32 Cubans may have been killed.

4. With Maduro in U.S. custody, why have we not redeployed our military personnel to other priority missions from which they were distracted? Every member of Congress should be asking why this administration still has thousands of U.S. personnel and dozens of U.S. assets deployed off the coast of Venezuela, and be wary of the openended nature of this mission.

5. Did the administration misrepresent intelligence to justify its military operation? In July 2025, the Department of the Treasury designated Cartel de los Soles as a “terrorist organization” and in November 2025 the State Department followed suit, although the administration never provided Congress intelligence to justify this designation. Yet on January 3, 2026, the Department of Justice issued a revised indictment against Maduro, which no longer claims that Cartel de los Soles is an organized entity that threatens Americans. This reversal calls into question the legal and intelligence framework that the Trump administration repeatedly cited to justify Congressionally unauthorized military operations in the region since September 2025.

6. What diplomacy did President Trump authorize prior to invading Venezuela? U.S. officials and the Maduro regime reportedly held detailed negotiations, including at least one phone conversation between President Trump and Maduro. Congress needs to better understand the substance of those negotiations and why they did not produce a peaceful outcome.

7. When did President Trump authorize U.S. military action to capture Maduro? In recent months, officials from some U.S. departments and agencies may have failed to fulfill their statutory obligations to keep Congress currently and fully informed of their agencies’ activities planning for regime change in Venezuela

8. Why did the Trump administration consult privately with oil companies “before and after” the operation, as the President put it – but not with Congress?

There is no reason for the President to brief corporate interests ahead or instead of the American people’s elected representatives regarding a U.S. military operation in a foreign country. While President Trump and Secretary Rubio claimed that they could not brief Congress for fear of potential leaks, this justification rings hollow when President Trump himself and members of his cabinet have disclosed sensitive, apparently classified information to the public, to journalists in Signal chats, and even U.S. adversaries. Moreover, the War Powers Resolution of 1973 requires the President to consult Congress “in every possible instance” before sending troops into war, unless the action is in response to an imminent threat facing American citizens or servicemembers – which was not true regarding Venezuela.

9. What does President Trump mean when he says he is prepared to deploy “boots on the ground” in Venezuela? Venezuela’s legitimate leadership did not invite the U.S. military to occupy its territory, and Congress has not authorized a military occupation.

10. What is the Trump administration’s plan to “run” Venezuela, as the President put it, and does that plan include a timeline for transitioning to Venezuela’s democratically elected government? President Trump stated on January 3: “We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.” However, other administration officials have suggested there will not be a transition and that U.S. policy is to coerce what remains of the Maduro regime to undertake unspecified actions in line with U.S. interests.

11. What factors led the Trump administration to abandon the bipartisan U.S. policy of recognizing Edmundo González Urrutia as the legitimate democratically elected leader of Venezuela? President Trump suggested that the opposition lacks support, but González overwhelmingly won the 2024 elections.

12. Did the Trump administration cut a deal with elements of interim President Delcy Rodríguez and her associates prior to the January 3 military operation, and what specific demands have we made of Rodríguez? The administration must publicly disclose the terms of any arrangement, as well as what the administration intends to do should Rodríguez not comply with any U.S. demands.

13. What intelligence led the Trump administration to conclude that Maduro’s security services will cooperate with any U.S. plan to “run” Venezuela and exploit its oil? The Venezuelan security services have a clear financial interest in maintaining the status quo. Congress must determine if the Trump administration plans to bribe illegitimate, corrupt, and repressive elements of the Maduro regime as part of the White House’s quest to control Venezuela’s oil.

14. What financial or other commitments has the Trump administration made to facilitate the expansion of U.S. oil companies’ footprint in Venezuela? On January 5, President Trump said that the United States may subsidize oil companies so that they can rebuild Venezuela’s oil infrastructure. Congress must determine if the President plans to make the American people foot the bill for private corporate interests in Venezuela.

15. Does the Trump administration plan to invade Colombia, Cuba, Mexico, and Greenland? President Trump has long asserted that Greenland, which is part of Denmark, should be a U.S. territory, implying willingness to take U.S. military action against a NATO ally. He similarly indicated a desire to pursue military action against Colombia and Mexico, longstanding U.S. counternarcotics and trade partners. Secretary Rubio also suggested that Cuba could be a future target of U.S. military action. Congress has not authorized any of these dangerous potential military operations.

The President’s recent actions in Venezuela risk implicating the United States in a corrupt bargain to govern a sovereign country alongside elements of an authoritarian regime, seemingly for the purpose of exploiting Venezuela’s oil. This is an unprecedented and dangerous break with decades of U.S. foreign policy. What the Trump administration does next in Venezuela – to say nothing of potential action against Colombia, Cuba, Greenland, and Mexico – will have serious implications for U.S. national security.

Congress must fulfill its constitutional duty to conduct oversight and reassert its role in future decisions regarding Venezuela. The American people expect that we will do our jobs on a bipartisan basis, and we encourage you to convene hearings on these questions and related issues without further delay.

Sincerely,

The day after that meeting, the war powers resolution was blocked by two votes.
The war powers resolution is not just a political fight, but a matter of life and death.","President Trump seemed angry after the Senate voted last Thursday to pass a war powers resolution to the next stage, where lawmakers could approve the measure and seek to curb the president’s ability to wage war in Venezuela without congressional authorization.

Trump said that day that five Republican senators who supported bringing the measure to a vote — Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.), Josh Hawley (Mo.) and Todd Young (Ind.) — “should never be elected to office again.”

Why should he get so riled up about this, to the point where he could put his own party’s control of the Senate at risk in November? Even if this resolution were to pass both houses of Congress, he could veto it and ultimately be unrestrained. He did this in 2019, when a war powers resolution mandating that the U.S. military cease its participation in the war in Yemen was passed in both the Senate and the House. Many people think that such legislation therefore can’t make a difference.

But the president’s ire is telling. These political moves on the Hill can get results even before the resolution has a final vote, or if it is vetoed by the president.

The Trump administration made significant concessions before the 2019 resolution was approved by Congress, in an attempt to prevent it from passing. For instance, months before it was approved, the U.S. military stopped refueling Saudi warplanes in midair. These concessions de-escalated the war and saved tens of thousands of lives.

A war powers resolution is an act of Congress that is based on a 1973 law of the same name. That law spells out and reinforces the power that our Constitution has allocated to Congress, to decide when the U.S. military can be involved in hostilities.

The U.S. military raid in Caracas that seized Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is illegal according to international law, the charters of the Organization of American States and the United Nations, as well as other treaties to which the United States is a signatory. According to our own Constitution, the government violates U.S. law when it violates treaties that our government has signed.

None of that restrained the Trump administration, which has not demonstrated much respect for the rule of law. But the White House does care about the political power of Congress. If there is an expanded war in Venezuela or anywhere else that Trump has threatened to use the military, the fact that Congress took steps to oppose it will increase the political cost to the president.

This is likely one of the main reasons that the Trump administration has at least promised to make concessions regarding military action in Latin America — and who knows, possibly he did make some compromises compared with what had been planned.

On Nov. 5, the day before the Senate was to vote on a war powers resolution to halt and prevent hostilities within or against Venezuela by U.S. armed forces, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and White House counsel had a private briefing with senators.

They assured lawmakers that they were not going to have a land war or airstrikes in Venezuela. According to news reports, the White House counsel stated that they did not have a legal justification for such a war. It is clear that blocking the resolution was very important to these top officials. The day after that meeting, the war powers resolution was blocked by two votes. Two Republicans had joined the Democrats and independents in support of the resolution: Murkowski and Paul. That added up to 49 votes — not quite the needed majority.

But on Thursday, there were three additional Republicans who voted for the new resolution, so it will proceed to a final vote.

The war powers resolution is not just a political fight, but a matter of life and death. The blockade involved in the seizure of oil tankers is, according to experts, an unlawful use of military force. This means that the blockade would be included as a participation in hostilities that would require authorization from Congress.

Since 2015, the United States has imposed unilateral economic sanctions that destroyed Venezuela’s economy. From 2012 to 2020, Venezuela suffered the worst peacetime depression in world history. Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP, or income, fell by 74%. Think of the economic destruction of the U.S. Great Depression, multiplied by three times. Most of this was the result of the sanctions.

This unprecedented devastation is generally attributed to Maduro in public discussion. But U.S. sanctions deliberately cut Venezuela off from international finance, as well as blocking most of its oil sales, which accounted for more than 90% of foreign exchange (mostly dollar) earnings. This devastated the economy.

In the first year of Trump sanctions from 2017-18, Venezuela’s deaths increased by tens of thousands of people, at a time when oil prices were increasing. Sanctions were expanded even more the following year. About a quarter of the population, more than 7 million people, emigrated after 2015 — 750,000 of them to the United States.

We know that the deadly impact of sanctions that target the civilian population is real. Research published in July by the Lancet Global Health, by my colleagues Francisco Rodriguez, Silvio Rendon and myself, estimated the global death toll from unilateral economic sanctions, as these are, at 564,000 per year over the past decade. This is comparable to the worldwide deaths from armed conflict. A majority of the victims over the 1970-2021 period were children.

The Trump administration has, in the last few days, been moving in the direction of lifting some sanctions to allow for oil exports, according to the president’s stated plan to “run Venezuela.” This is ironic because Venezuela has for many years wanted more investment and trade, including in oil, with the United States, and it was U.S. sanctions that prohibited it.

Such lifting of sanctions would be a big step forward, in terms of saving lives of people who are deprived of food, medicine and other necessities in Venezuela, as a result of these sanctions and the economic destruction that they cause.

But to create the stability that Venezuela needs to recover, we will have to take the military and economic violence out of this campaign. There are members of Congress moving toward that goal, and they need all the help that they can get, before it’s too late.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/076818f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F84%2F33%2F7943dedc407e900a8e9892bf9cc0%2Fmurkowski-reelection-21054.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 09:57:37.382778

And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.

It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.
Nancy Albrecht, John Cairns, John Davenport and Barb Iverson, who are members of the Re-imagining Community Safety group at Plymouth Congregational Church, also contributed.","As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to unleash raids in Minneapolis, our police officers face the same struggle as in other target cities — including our sister city of St. Paul — to keep people safe without assisting in those raids.

After several months of study and public input following questions raised about Minneapolis police’s crowd control tactics during the overly militarized Lake Street raid in June, the city amended the separation ordinance to strengthen and clarify this issue. In addition, MPD has used its own settlement agreement process with the state Department of Human Rights to gather its own public input, and released a revised immigration policy that both more clearly prohibits assisting ICE and provides more protection to the public.

One can make the case that this wouldn’t have happened without strong and sustained public pressure, but the bottom line is that it did happen.

MPD Chief Brian O’Hara described the new policies at a press conference just days after the Trump administration announced “Operation Metro Surge,” which continues to seize members of both our Somali and Hispanic communities and create chaos. The new policy restates the current general rule that MPD will “not participate in immigration enforcement,” and goes further to say that MPD also shall “not assist in the removal or transportation of people”; “not provide crowd management solely at the request of immigration enforcement agencies”; and, absent “a clear an immediate threat to life, serious injury, or destruction of property…will not escort federal immigration agents to enforcement locations or close streets when there are no traffic or public safety issues.”

Finally, the new policy specifically affirms that gathering a crowd to protest is a “First Amendment-protected event”; that MPD will record and report any federal violations of this right; and that MPD “will verbally or physically intervene” against any federal use of excessive force as soon as there is “a reasonable and safe opportunity to do so.”

During his press conference, O’Hara made clear that this incudes responding to 911 calls from terrified residents. Indeed, he told the New York Times this week that his agency has seen a marked increase in 911 calls responding to the newly volatile situation.

Of course, MPD cannot and must not launch an armed attack against federal officers, but they have made clear that their foremost duty is to “protect and serve” our community, not invasive federal agents. And, that they will do as much as the law allows to hold federal officers accountable if they cross the line.

As O’Hara pointed out, the new policies and training will “remind our officers of their duty to intervene.”

The dilemma that our community faces is that MPD’s recent commitment to the law and Constitution — refraining from escorting ICE agents or providing ICE crowd control, while upholding First Amendment rights by declining to dispatch officers to ICE protests absent a “clear and immediate threat” — means that MPD may not be present to intervene when ICE attacks protesters suddenly and without any forewarning or provocation.

That’s what happened when an ICE agent killed Renee Nicole Good.

Even in the face of this dilemma, however, MPD has continued to honor its reinforced commitment to constitutional policing during the massive protests following the killing. It is clear that O’Hara will not allow ICE provocations to divert MPD from this commitment.

This is a good example of the kind of transformation that citizens demanded after the police murder of George Floyd, and which was codified by the settlement agreement with the Department of Human Rights.

Even in the face of the current chaos and distress, we should all be encouraged by this strong step by our local law enforcement in the right direction.

“Voters elected President Trump to put American lives first — and that’s exactly what he’s doing,"" she said.
""President Trump is making our country safer, and the American people will remember it in November.”","NEW YORK -- It's only two weeks into the new year, and President Donald Trump has already claimed control of Venezuela, escalated threats to seize Greenland and flooded American streets with masked immigration agents.

And that's not even counting an unprecedented criminal investigation at the Federal Reserve, a cornerstone of the national economy that Trump wants to bend to his will.

Even for a president who thrives on chaos, Trump is generating a stunning level of turmoil as voters prepare to deliver their verdict on his leadership in the upcoming midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

Each decision carries tremendous risks, from the possibility of an overseas quagmire to undermining the country's financial system, but Trump has barreled forward with a ferocity that has rattled even some of his Republican allies.

“The presidency has gone rogue,” said historian Joanne B. Freeman, a Yale University professor. She said it's something ""we haven’t seen in this way before.”

Trump seems undeterred by the potential blowback. Although he doesn't always follow through, he seems intent on doubling and tripling down whenever possible.

“Right now I’m feeling pretty good,"" Trump said Tuesday in Detroit. His speech was ostensibly arranged to refocus attention on the economy, which the president claimed is surging despite lingering concerns about higher prices.

However, he couldn't resist lashing out at Jerome Powell, who leads the Federal Reserve and has resisted Trump's pressure to lower interest rates.

""That jerk will be gone soon,” Trump said.

Republican leaders have overwhelmingly rallied behind Trump throughout his turbulent second term. But new cracks began to appear this week immediately after Powell disclosed on Sunday that the Federal Reserve was facing a criminal investigation over his testimony about the central bank's building renovations.

Over the last year, the Justice Department has already pursued criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and former national security adviser John Bolton, among other Trump adversaries.

But going after Powell, who helps set the nation's monetary policy, appeared to be a step too far for some conservatives. Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, a fierce Trump defender, was unusually critical.

“It just feels like most on Wall Street do not want to see this kind of fight,” she said during her Monday show. “The president has very good points, certainly. But Wall Street doesn’t want to see this kind of investigation.”

The Federal Reserve plays a key role in the economy by calibrating interest rates, which Trump insists should be lower. However, reducing the institution's independence could backfire and cause borrowing costs to increase instead.

At the same time, Trump has decided to expand the United States' role in complicated foreign entanglements — a seeming departure from the “America First” foreign policy that he promised on the campaign trail.

No move was more significant than the U.S. military operation earlier this month to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from his country. In the months leading up to the attack, Trump frequently insisted he was targeting Maduro because of his role in the drug trade. He has quickly pivoted to portraying the move as an economic opportunity for the U.S.

Trump has said the U.S. will start controlling the sale of some Venezuelan oil, and he declared that the South American nation will be run from Washington. He even posted a meme declaring himself the “acting president of Venezuela.”

Trump has also threatened the leadership of Cuba and Iran, while insisting that the U.S. will control Greenland “ one way or the other ” — a position that has raised questions about U.S. relations with European allies. Greenland belongs to Denmark, a NATO member.

Meanwhile, Trump's immigration crackdown continues to spark confrontations in American cities. Some have turned deadly, such as when a federal agent shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three in Minneapolis.

Administration officials have said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer acted in self-defense, accusing Good of trying to hit him with her car. But that explanation has been widely disputed by local officials and others based on videos circulating online.

The incident came after Trump dispatched 2,000 immigration agents to Minnesota, responding to reports of fraud involving the state's Somali community.

On Tuesday, Trump said the administration was targeting “thousands of already convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners, dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums, and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention.”

The Trump administration's moves have created “chaos, confusion and uncertainty,” said Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb, who leads the Democratic Mayors Association.

“There’s so much uncertainty across my city right now. The ICE raids in Minneapolis have really shocked the consciousness of many of my residents, and we’re trying to do everything we can to calm that concerns and quell those fears,"" Bibb said. “But people don’t feel like the world is getting better. People don’t feel like the economy is getting better.”

Voters across the nation will have their next chance to weigh in on Trump's leadership at the ballot box this November, when Republicans hope to retain control of Congress for the last two years of his presidency.

Democratic campaign officials in Washington are focused largely on the economy in their early political messaging. Most voters maintain a decidedly negative view on the issue, despite Trump's rosy assessment this week.

Just 31% of U.S. adults approved of how the president is handling the economy, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. That marked the lowest economic approval he’s registered in an AP-NORC poll in his first or second term.

“Donald Trump’s visit to Michigan puts a glaring, unflattering spotlight on how he and House Republicans have failed to address the affordability crisis,"" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, who leads the Democrats' House campaign arm.

But some activists are frustrated that their party's leadership isn't focusing more on Trump's unprecedented power grabs.

Ezra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he expects Trump's actions to get worse as his second and final term nears its conclusion.

“Folks at the end of last year who thought he would become a typical lame duck and limp toward a midterm loss have a framework for understanding this moment that is drastically outdated,” Levin said. “Authoritarians don’t willingly give up power. When weakened and cornered they lash out.”

Trump has repeatedly insisted he's only doing what voters elected him to do, and his allies in Washington remain overwhelmingly united behind him.

Republican National Committee spokesperson Kiersten Pels predicted that voters will reward the party this year.

“Voters elected President Trump to put American lives first — and that’s exactly what he’s doing,"" she said. ""President Trump is making our country safer, and the American people will remember it in November.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8b647de8-0ecd-40e1-b9f1-db2af42b7927/wirestory_bed4a7dc82dd4468d0382494c7a941ad_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-14 07:57:15.537352

GEO Group is the same private prison company that runs numerous immigrant detention centers, including Delaney Hall in Newark.
“We know what GEO Group has done in our state — it’s caused our communities immense harm in their private, underregulated detention centers,” Reisman said.
A GEO Group representative referred inquiries to ICE, but representatives for the agency also did not respond.
“It’s not just going to affect immigrants, undocumented immigrants, lawful immigrants.","The ‘skip tracing’ contract will supercharge surveillance of immigrants, financial incentives will turn contractors into bounty hunters, critics say.

The federal government has hired a company owned by a controversial private prison firm to track immigrants they’re looking to deport, even as experts and civil rights activists condemn the move as a “recipe for disaster.”

Under a two-year, $121 million contract between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and a subsidiary of GEO Group called BI Incorporated, the company will perform “skip tracing” services for the federal government. GEO Group is the same private prison company that runs numerous immigrant detention centers, including Delaney Hall in Newark.

According to an announcement about the contract, the work includes “enhanced location research with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation to verify current address information and investigate alternative address information for individuals on the federal government’s non-detained docket.”

In other words, the company will be searching public records and other data sources to track down the undocumented immigrants ICE hasn’t been able to find yet, experts said.

In the statement announcing the deal, GEO Group Chairman George Zoley crowed that the contract “is a testament to the high-quality solutions BI has provided to ICE for more than 21 years.”

But others, including advocates for immigrants, academics, and civil liberties watchdogs, say the federal government’s decision to outsource and effectively privatize data mining and surveillance operations will lead to nothing but trouble.

“Basically, it’s going to be what we would think of as bounty hunting — minus the ability to actually physically detain someone,” said Lori Nessel, a law professor at Seton Hall University and director of the school’s Immigrants’ Rights and International Human Rights Law Clinic.

“But what’s really disturbing is the language allows for ‘all available technology’ in terms of the surveillance. So there are huge privacy concerns,” she told The Jersey Vindicator.

Nessel also said the contract is incentive-based, which will encourage the firm to find as many people as it can, and quickly. That rush to meet a quota often leads to mistakes and constitutional violations.

She also suspects there will be little transparency about how, exactly, BI Incorporated goes about its work.

“It’s not clear where the legal authority comes from for a government agency to contract out this type of law enforcement function without limits,” she said. “So, I’m not sure where the accountability and oversight will come from … It’s a recipe for disaster.”

The deal has also attracted the attention of at least one member of Congress, and he expressed similar concerns in a November letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

“Allowing private contractors to perform enforcement activities under a system of performance-based financial incentives, essentially bounty hunting, outsources one of the government’s most coercive powers to actors who operate with little oversight and limited public accountability,” Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois wrote.

“Once the state begins contracting out its power to police, it invites the very abuses, secrecy, and corruption our founders sought to prevent,” Krishnamoorthi, who is also running for the U.S. Senate, said. “The idea of authorizing unknown private individuals to walk through neighborhoods, observing, photographing, and verifying the whereabouts of those they believe to be undocumented, is deeply troubling.”

Dillon Reisman, a staff attorney with the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, also worried that the contractor happens to be a subsidiary of GEO Group, which has for months been accused of abusing and neglecting detainees at Delaney Hall.

“We know what GEO Group has done in our state — it’s caused our communities immense harm in their private, underregulated detention centers,” Reisman said. “Why would we trust this specific company with our data and with this task that is inherently harmful to civil liberties?”

BI Incorporated did not respond to a request for comment. A GEO Group representative referred inquiries to ICE, but representatives for the agency also did not respond.

How skip tracing works

Skip tracing isn’t new, experts said.

But it’s usually performed by real law enforcement agencies trying to find missing people who skipped out on bail, a debt, or a court date, according to David Opderbeck, a Seton Hall law professor and the co-director of the Gibbons Institute of Law, Science & Technology and the school’s Institute for Privacy Protection.

The job’s gotten easier as more and more public records migrate online, and recent leaps in artificial intelligence will let contractors use automated tools to scrape social media profiles and other parts of the web.

“It’s getting pretty sophisticated,” Opderbeck said.

And because ICE has information-sharing agreements with other federal agencies — including the IRS — contractors will likely be able to get their hands on tax records and other financial documents, he said.

“It’s always a concern when you’ve got a third-party contractor handling potentially very sensitive data,” he said. “Who knows what civil rights guardrails are built into this contract? I doubt many.”

Opderbeck worried ICE could weaponize the information against legal immigrants and those with valid asylum claims — or citizen watchdog groups who constantly protest the agency.

“Governments have been doing this kind of stuff for a long time,” he said. “But there’s a big potential for overly aggressive surveillance and maybe abuse of these tools … that’s pretty frightening to me.”

Nessel, his Seton Hall colleague, agreed.

“I think everyone needs to be concerned about losing privacy protections,” she said. “It’s not just going to affect immigrants, undocumented immigrants, lawful immigrants. It’ll be U.S. citizens, it will be all of us that will be impacted by this surveillance.”

The final details of ICE’s plan are still unclear, but the U.S. Department of Homeland Security gave a glimpse of the operation in documents obtained by The Intercept via a Freedom of Information request in late October.

In the nine-page document, the agency said it wants its contractor to use “government-furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation services to verify alien address information, investigate alternative alien address information, confirm the new location of aliens, and deliver materials/documents to aliens as appropriate.”

That might include searching through public records, social media sites, and other apps for information, then using the results to track down an undocumented immigrant’s home and job.

The request also asked for “a collection of photos and documents” to verify the addresses, and asked contractors to document each visit and provide “time-stamped photographs of the location.”

Then they would report back to the feds as soon as possible.

Given the Trump administration’s fixation on deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, the work will be plentiful. Department of Homeland Security officials said its initial docket would include the names of 10,000 people, and that could balloon up to 1 million over time.

The agency also offered an “incentive-based pricing structure” that pays out based on the contractor’s success rate, according to the document.

For example, the Department of Homeland Security will pay more if the contractor verifies an immigrant’s home on the first try or finishes 90% of the caseload before the deadline.

“This encourages the vendor to prioritize accuracy, efficiency, and professionalism in their operations,” an agency official wrote.

In his letter, Krishnamoorthi, the Illinois congressman, pilloried the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for those pay incentives, which he said turn contractors into bounty hunters.

“In such a system built on quotas and cash rewards with minimal oversight, mistakes are not just possible — they are certain. When that happens, it is not a paperwork error but an entirely predictable violation of rights with real human costs,” Krishnamoorthi wrote.

“This approach does not invite abuse; it guarantees it, putting the liberty and well-being of the American public at risk,” he wrote.

Reisman, of the ACLU, would agree.

“It’s really dangerous to get private companies invested in the mission of investigating, arresting, and detaining people — it makes the incentives profit-based,” he said.

“That means the system is not geared towards justice or mercy or fairness,” he said. “It’s geared towards getting more money.”",https://jerseyvindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/K104269-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 06:58:45.954302

The proposal is part of a broader legislative push by Wiener aimed at law enforcement accountability.","SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California lawmakers are again positioning the state in direct opposition to the Trump administration, this time with legislation that would allow residents to sue federal immigration officials for alleged constitutional violations.

The proposal, Senate Bill 747, authored by Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, seeks to close what supporters call a longstanding legal loophole that shields federal law enforcement officers from civil lawsuits in cases where state or local officers could be held liable.

Wiener has dubbed the measure the “No Kings Act,” arguing it is necessary amid increased immigration enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“We’re here today because ICE and the Trump administration are trampling over the Constitution and need to be held accountable,” Wiener said. “We’ve had enough of this terror campaign in our communities by ICE.”

Under current federal law — specifically Section 1983 of the U.S. Code — individuals may sue state or local officials for violations of constitutional rights, but federal officers are excluded. SB 747 would create a state-level cause of action allowing lawsuits against federal agents for misconduct occurring in California.

Supporters say the bill does not break new legal ground but instead addresses an imbalance in accountability.

“We are not breaking radical new ground here,” said Democratic Sen. Josh Becker of Menlo Park. “We are closing a loophole.”

They also clarified the intention of the bill.

“This is not an attack on law enforcement. This bill is not anti-law enforcement. This bill is pro Constitution, pro accountability and pro public trust,"" said Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from Baldwin Park.

Civil liberties advocates argue the lack of accountability has left victims with little recourse. Anya Bidwell, an attorney with the Institute for Justice, said federal officers are often able to avoid lawsuits because courts routinely dismiss claims under doctrines such as discretionary immunity.

“If this were state or local officials, we would be in court right now,” Bidwell said.

The Institute for Justice represents George Retes, a U.S. citizen and military veteran who was detained for 72 hours by ICE last July while driving to work. Retes said officers broke his car window, deployed tear gas and pepper spray, and forcibly removed him despite his claims that he did not resist.

“I was free to go, and I just got to live with the experience that they put me through,” Retes said.

Bidwell said Retes has not filed a lawsuit because existing law makes such cases unlikely to succeed. That is why the two stand firmly behind SB 747.

“The reason ICE does what it does is because they know it is extremely difficult to sue,” she said.

Opponents argue the bill would infringe on federal authority and create legal chaos by allowing states to regulate federal agents.

“We cannot have 50 different states deciding how they think we should be operating,” said Bill Essayli, first assistant U.S. attorney. “The states do not have the authority to regulate federal agents, period.”

Essayli added that it's Congress that regulates federal authorities.

Republican lawmakers also criticized the proposal. Assemblymember Tom Lackey of Palmdale -- who served in law enforcement for decades himself -- said the bill could further inflame anti-law-enforcement sentiment.

“I believe that this is going to feed a fire of anti-law enforcement that is unjustified,” Lackey said.

Supporters acknowledge that Congress could amend federal law to address the issue directly but argue states must act in the absence of federal reform.

If passed, SB 747 would apply only to incidents occurring in California and would be retroactive to March 1, 2025, a provision that could open the door to lawsuits over recent enforcement actions.

The proposal is part of a broader legislative push by Wiener aimed at law enforcement accountability. A separate bill by the senator that would restrict most officers from wearing masks while on duty is scheduled for a hearing this week and has already drawn opposition from the Trump administration.

The bill passed through the Senate Judicial Committee with a majority vote late Tuesday. The bill advances to the Senate Appropriations Committee next then would advance to the Senate floor.

This article features a Government Accountability Project case and was originally published here.

Lawmakers from both parties and houses of Congress have agreed to provide about $653 million to fund Voice of America’s parent agency, rejecting President Donald Trump’s demand to defund the international broadcaster and shut it down.

The outlay is included in a broader bipartisan spending deal negotiated by House and Senate appropriators. The package still requires House and Senate approval before heading to Trump’s desk.

“We understand the realities of the appropriations process, but I am disappointed that Congress is proposing half a billion dollars more in funding than we requested,” Kari Lake, the deputy CEO installed by Trump to shut down the agency, wrote in a statement Monday. “While reductions from prior years are a step in the right direction, USAGM can still advance President Trump’s message and share America’s story globally without wasting so much taxpayer money.”

The bipartisan commitment to funding USAGM reflects continued congressional support for America’s role in promoting the free flow of news and information abroad, a long-standing foundation of its soft power around the world.

Congress’s funding proposal comes after a dire year for USAGM. Trump signed an executive order in March calling for the dismantlement of the government agency, which oversees Voice of America and funds nonprofit groups including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. To carry out the order, Lake placed more than 1,300 Voice of America staffers on paid administrative leave — many of whom are still not working — and halted broadcasting operations the same month.

Lake, a former Arizona television anchor who lost high-profile races for governor and U.S. Senate in recent years, has defended the cuts and called for the agency’s eventual elimination. She told Congress in a June hearing that USAGM was “incompetent, corrupt, biased, and a threat to America’s national security and standing in the world.” She has also said USAGM is “not salvageable.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth issued a preliminary injunction in April ordering the agency to uphold its statutory obligations for broadcasting. As a result, VOA began producing content again in four languages: Farsi, Pashto, Dari and Mandarin. (VOA previously broadcast in 49 languages.)

When Lake subsequently ordered mass layoffs at USAGM through a reduction-in-force, or RIF, Lamberth blocked her from doing so, saying those cuts would put the agency out of compliance with his injunction. He also chastised Lake and her “concerning disrespect” for the law and ordered that she be deposed under threat of contempt proceedings.

Lamberth, an 82-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan, also criticized the administration for not spending what it was appropriated by Congress. “When Congress appropriated $260 million to VOA for FY 2025, it did not anticipate that such a significant sum of taxpayer funds would be used to pay employees to sit at home for months on end, making no contribution to VOA’s statutory mandate,” Lamberth wrote, noting the total specifically appropriated for VOA’s use in USAGM’s last budget.

The bill allocates $199.5 million of the total appropriation to VOA and $138 million for USAGM’s operations. Additionally, nonprofit grantees will also be funded through this bill to the tune of $112.5 million for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, $69 million for Middle East Broadcasting Networks, $53.5 million for Radio Free Asia and $40.5 million for the Open Technology Fund. The Trump administration pushed to defund the nonprofit media outlets, but Lamberth has largely restored their funding in court after they all sued.

Radio Free Asia previously said it was pausing operations but in recent months has resumed some publishing activities. “With new funding, if enacted, RFA anticipates ramping up additional news operations that have been paused in the Asia-Pacific region,” RFA spokesman Rohit Mahajan said in a statement.

Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), the top Democrat on the state and foreign operations subcommittee, applauded the bipartisan negotiation that led to the bill but expressed worry that it still represented a cut to government broadcasters.

“While the bill ensures continued funding for our international broadcasting grantees,” he wrote in a statement, “it forces cuts at a time when they are trying to provide critical services in Ukraine, the Middle East, and across the Indo-Pacific.”

Schatz and his House counterpart, Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Florida), previously criticized the Trump administration’s “illegal gutting” of the agency.

A Senate committee passed Senate Bill 747 by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), which would provide Californians with a stronger ability to take legal action against federal law enforcement agents over excessive use of force, unlawful home searches, interfering with a right to protest and other violations.

California law already allows such suits against state and local law enforcement officials.

Successful civil suits against federal officers over constitutional rights are less common.

Wiener, appearing before Tuesday’s Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, said his bill has taken on new urgency in the wake of the death of Renee Nicole Good in Minnesota, the 37-year-old mother of three who was shot while driving on a snowy Minneapolis street.

Good was shot by an agent in self-defense, said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who alleged that Good tried to use her car as a weapon to run over the immigration officer.

Good’s death outraged Democratic leaders across the country, who accuse federal officers of flouting laws in their efforts to deport thousands of undocumented immigrants. In New York, legislators are proposing legislation similar to the one proposed by Wiener that would allow state-level civil actions against federal officers.

George Retes Jr., a U.S. citizen and Army veteran who was kept in federal custody for three days in July, described his ordeal at Tuesday’s committee hearing, and how immigration officers swarmed him during a raid in Camarillo.

Retes, a contracted security guard at the farm that was raided, said he was brought to Port Hueneme Naval Base. Officials swabbed his cheek to obtain DNA, and then moved him to Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. He was not allowed to make a phone call or see an attorney, he said.

“I did not resist, I did not impede or assault any agent,” Retes said.”What happened to me that day was not a misunderstanding. It was a violation of the Constitution by the very people sworn to uphold it.”

He also accused Department of Homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin of spreading false information about him to justify his detention. DHS said in a statement last year that Retes impeded their operation, which he denies.

Retes has filed a tort claim against the U.S. government, a process that is rarely successful, said his attorney, Anya Bidwell.

Lawsuits can also be brought through the Bivens doctrine, which refers to the 1971 Supreme Court ruling Bivens vs. Six Unknown Federal Agents that established that federal officials can be sued for monetary damages for constitutional violations. But in recent decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly restricted the ability to sue under Bivens.

Wiener’s bill, if passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, would be retroactive to March 2025.

“We’ve had enough of this terror campaign in our communities by ICE,” said Wiener at a news conference before the hearing. “We need the rule of law and we need accountability.”

Weiner is running for the congressional seat held by former House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).

Representatives for law enforcement agencies appeared at Tuesday’s hearing to ask for amendments to ensure that the bill wouldn’t lead to weakened protections for state and local officials.

“We’re not opposed to the intent of the bill. We’re just concerned about the future and the unintended consequences for your California employees,” said David Mastagni, speaking on behalf of the Peace Officers Research Assn. of California, which represents more than 85,000 public safety members.

The husbands are a mixed-status couple — Jonathan Blanco Gallegos is a U.S. citizen, and his husband, Elias Perez-Zuazo, is undocumented.

Perez-Zuazo was detained Dec. 10 during what they thought was supposed to be a routine, annual check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The couple was already in the process of applying for Perez-Zuazo’s green card.

Blanco Gallegos and Perez-Zuazo were married in D.C. Feb. 27, 2024. At the time, the idea of life apart was unthinkable. Now, it’s their reality.

“Basically, it feels like something from inside you,” Blanco Gallegos said. “They take him away, and your life’s put on pause. And I need somebody to come back and press play, right, but it’s not gonna happen.”

Perez-Zuazo had a check-in with ICE at a facility in Chantilly, Virginia, which Blanco Gallegos says his husband had been doing annually. What normally would take 45 minutes, Blanco Gallegos says, took several hours. As he waited for Perez-Zuazo in the parking lot, he realized something was wrong.

“He has been detained with no reason, no excuse, no paperwork, no nothing,” he said. “They just give me his stuff outside of the parking lot. An ICE agent coming out from the building and says, ‘oh, are you Elias' husband?’ Yes. ‘Okay, here is his stuff. He's been in detention.’”

Perez-Zuazo is from Panama. Blanco Gallegos says his husband crossed into the U.S. without documentation in November 2021. Blanco Gallegos says his husband was processed by immigration authorities at the Texas/Mexico border and was released on his own recognizance, allowed to go live with a sponsor in Washington, D.C. while his immigration case played out in court.

Perez-Zuazo and Blanco Gallegos met in 2023, started dating and eventually got married. They’ve started the green card application process and have made some progress. Perez-Zuazo’s I-130 petition was approved, which is the first step needed for someone to obtain U.S. residency through a spouse or family member. But now, with Perez-Zuazo detained and with no clarity over if or when he’ll be released, Blanco Gallegos says he’s not sure that the future they pictured will come together.

“I got home; my bed is empty. He's not in there. He's not cooking anymore for me. So it's so many things that your life changed,” he said. “Like from day to night. My heart is broken.”

Blanco Gallegos says their attorney has been seeking clarity from ICE, trying to figure out why his husband was detained and whether he’s facing any charges. Blanco Gallegos claims ICE has not been responsive.

News4 reached out to the agency asking why Perez-Zuazo was detained. ICE sent a statement which says, “On December 10, ICE arrested Elias Enoc Perez-Zuazo, an illegal alien from Panama. He illegally crossed the border in November 2021 and was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden administration. He received full due process and was ordered removed by an immigration judge in November 2021 and was RELEASED into this country by the Biden administration. This administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.”

Blanco Gallegos shared his husband’s “Order of Release On Recognizance” form with News4 – which was issued by ICE. The form states Perez-Zuazo was placed in removal proceedings after he was initially processed by immigration authorities in November 2021, but so far, News4 has been unable to find out if an immigration judge has issued a deportation order for Perez-Zuazo. A search for his case in the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s online database yields zero results. Perez-Zuazo’s attorney denies that an immigration judge has issued a deportation order, saying that’s not consistent with the documents he’s reviewed in the case and argues that if such an order was actually issued, Perez-Zuazo would have already been deported.

In the meantime, Perez-Zuazo’s attorney filed a ""habeas corpus petition” in federal court, which challenges the detention, characterizing it as unlawful. Blanco Gallegos told News4 he fears what would happen if his husband is deported back to his home country.

“It’s going to be hard since Panama is not a gay-friendly country,” he said. “Because same-sex couples is not allowed over there. So our life is going to be at risk.”

Perez-Zuazo’s case underscores the Trump Administration’s massive push to detain immigrants in ICE facilities. According to the latest data compiled by the The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, the number of people detained by ICE jumped by nearly 40,000 from 2024 to 2025.",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2026/01/DC-couple-in-limbo-after-husband-is-detained-by-ICE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-13 23:57:22.567636

Minnesota officials have also raised alarm after federal officials blocked state investigators from accessing evidence and declared that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.
Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department does not believe there is currently any basis to open a criminal civil rights investigation into the killing of a woman by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis, a top department official said Tuesday.

The decision to keep the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division out of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good marks a sharp departure from past administrations, which have moved quickly to probe shootings of civilians by law enforcement officials for potential civil rights offenses.

While an FBI probe is ongoing, lawyers in the Civil Rights Division were informed last week that they would not play a role in the investigation at this time, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal department deliberations.

And on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation.” The statement, first reported by CNN, did not elaborate on how the department had reached a conclusion that no investigation was warranted.

Federal officials have said that the officer acted in self-defense and that the driver of the Honda was engaging in “an act of domestic terrorism” when she pulled forward toward him.

The quick pronouncement by administration officials before any meaningful investigation could be completed has raised concerns about the federal government’s determination to conduct a thorough review of the chain of events precipitating the shooting. Minnesota officials have also raised alarm after federal officials blocked state investigators from accessing evidence and declared that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

Also this week, roughly half a dozen federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned and several supervisors in the criminal section of the Civil Rights Division in Washington gave notice of their departures amid turmoil over the federal probe, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the departures in Minnesota is First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, who had been leading the sprawling investigation and prosecution of fraud schemes in the state, two other people said. At least four other prosecutors in the Minnesota U.S. attorney’s office joined Thompson in resigning amid a period of tension in the office, the people said. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.

They are the latest in an exodus of career Justice Department attorneys who have resigned or been forced out over concerns over political pressure or shifting priorities under the Trump administration. Hundreds of Justice Department lawyers have been fired or have left voluntarily over the last year.

Minnesota Democratic lawmakers criticized the departures, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, calling the resignations “a loss for our state and for public safety” and warning that prosecutions should not be driven by politics. Gov. Tim Walz said the departures raised concerns about political pressure on career Justice Department officials.

The resignations of the lawyers in the Civil Rights Division’s criminal section, including its chief, were announced to staff on Monday, days after lawyers were told the section would not be involved in the probe. The Justice Department on Tuesday said those prosecutors had requested to participate in an early retirement program “well before the events in Minnesota,” and added that “any suggestion to the contrary is false.”

Founded nearly 70 years ago, the Civil Rights Division has a long history of investigating shootings by law enforcement even though prosecutors typically need to clear a high bar to mount a criminal prosecution.

In prior administrations, the division has moved quickly to open and publicly announce such investigations, not only to reflect federal jurisdiction over potential civil rights violations but also in hopes of soothing community angst that sometimes accompanies shootings involving law enforcement.

“The level of grief, tension and anxiety on the ground in Minnesota is not surprising,” said Kristen Clarke, who led the Civil Rights Division under the Biden administration. “And historically the federal government has played an important role by being a neutral and impartial agency committing its resources to conducting a full and fair investigation, and the public loses out when that doesn’t happen,” she said.

In Minneapolis, for instance, the Justice Department during the first Trump administration opened a civil rights investigation into the 2020 death of George Floyd at the hands of city police officers that resulted in criminal charges. The Minneapolis Police Department was separately scrutinized by the Biden administration for potential systemic civil rights violations through what’s known as a “pattern or practice” investigation, a type of police reform inquiry that is out of favor in the current Trump administration Justice Department.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/464f823/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3900x2194+0+204/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F36%2F79%2F6a20b336abcc5a36022284269229%2F36c7ff5099fa495885f8579d8a5b0355,N,,2026-01-14 00:57:34.572282

“We’re going to revoke the citizenship of any naturalised immigrant from Somalia or anywhere else who is convicted of defrauding our citizens,” Trump said on Tuesday.

The administration has additionally cut off Minnesota’s access to federal childcare assistance and surged immigration enforcement agents to the state, home to a sizeable Somali population, prompting widespread anger and condemnation from local and state officials over aggressive immigration raids.

Senior Justice Department officials overruled the decision to cooperate with the state agency.","Six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned on Tuesday over the Justice Department’s push to investigate the widow of a woman killed by an ICE agent and the department’s reluctance to investigate the shooter, according to people with knowledge of their decision.

Joseph H. Thompson, who was second in command at the U.S. attorney’s office and oversaw a sprawling fraud investigation that has roiled Minnesota’s political landscape, was among those who quit on Tuesday, according to three people with knowledge of the decision.

Mr. Thompson’s resignation came after senior Justice Department officials pressed for a criminal investigation into the actions of the widow of Renee Nicole Good, the Minneapolis woman killed by an ICE agent on Wednesday.

Mr. Thompson, 47, a career prosecutor, objected to that approach, as well as to the Justice Department’s refusal to include state officials in investigating whether the shooting itself was lawful, the people familiar with his decision said.

The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O’Hara, said in an interview that Mr. Thompson’s resignation dealt a major blow to efforts to root out rampant theft from state agencies. The fraud cases, which involve schemes to cheat safety net programs, were the chief reason the Trump administration cited for its immigration crackdown in the state. The vast majority of defendants charged in the cases are American citizens of Somali origin.

“When you lose the leader responsible for making the fraud cases, it tells you this isn’t really about prosecuting fraud,” Mr. O’Hara said.

The other senior career prosecutors who resigned include Harry Jacobs, Melinda Williams and Thomas Calhoun-Lopez. Mr. Jacobs had been Mr. Thompson’s deputy overseeing the fraud investigation, which began in 2022. Mr. Calhoun-Lopez was the chief of the violent and major crimes unit.

Mr. Thompson, Mr. Jacobs, Ms. Williams and Mr. Calhoun-Lopez declined to discuss the reasons they resigned. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Tuesday’s resignations followed tumultuous days at the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota as prosecutors there and in Washington struggled to manage the outrage over Ms. Good’s killing, which set off angry protests in Minnesota and across the nation.

After Ms. Good was shot, Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, told her staff that she would not consider opening an investigation into whether the agent had violated federal law, according to three current and former department officials who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the situation. At least four prosecutors who had already intended to quit or retire signaled they would accelerate their departures, those officials said.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said in a statement that “there is currently no basis for a criminal civil rights investigation” into the ICE agent.

Instead, the Justice Department launched an investigation to examine ties between Ms. Good and her wife, Becca, and several groups that have been monitoring and protesting the conduct of immigration agents in recent weeks. Shortly after Wednesday’s fatal shooting, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, referred to Ms. Good as a “domestic terrorist.”

Mr. Thompson strenuously objected to the decision not to investigate the shooting as a civil rights matter, and was outraged by the demand to launch a criminal investigation into Becca Good, according to the people familiar with the developments, who were not authorized to discuss them publicly.

Mr. Thompson had originally set out to investigate the shooting in partnership with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, a state agency that reviews police shootings. Senior Justice Department officials overruled the decision to cooperate with the state agency.

Drew Evans, the superintendent of the bureau, called Mr. Thompson’s departure a major setback for the effort to root out fraud in the state and for public safety.

“We’re losing a true public servant,” said Mr. Evans. “We really need professional prosecutors.”

The absence of a credible and comprehensive investigation into Ms. Good’s killing stands to “undermine trust in our public safety agencies,” Mr. Evans added.

Mr. Thompson’s departure came during the chaotic immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which has angered many residents and left officials bracing for an escalation of violence.

Begun in December with the deployment of roughly 100 federal agents from out of state, the operation has swelled to include some 2,000 federal agents. By comparison, the Minneapolis Police Department has roughly 600 officers.

Local leaders and immigrant rights groups have decried the agents’ conduct, saying that they have been stopping people based only on looks and accents. Often, these stops have led to the violent arrest of both immigrants and American citizens, according to local officials and observers who have recorded mayhem using cell phones.

On Monday, Minnesota’s attorney general and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding an end to the crackdown, asserting that it had led to numerous abuses and civil rights violations.

The Minneapolis police chief, Mr. O’Hara, told The New York Times in an interview that the operation could lead to more deaths and the kind of widespread civil unrest that followed the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.

The Trump administration has cited the fraud investigation that Mr. Thompson led to justify the surge of agents, which federal officials have called the largest immigration enforcement operation in history.

Most of the defendants charged to date are of Somali ancestry, but are American citizens by birth or naturalization.

President Trump and several top aides have seized on the matter to argue that Somalis are swindling the nation. Mr. Trump has called Somalis “garbage,” and he said his administration was considering denaturalizing some, because, he says, “they hate our country.”

Mr. Thompson grew frustrated in recent weeks as the immigration surge became a distraction for the office’s work on fraud, undermining the goal the administrations said it was trying to pursue, according to people familiar with his thinking.

The fraud cases — which involve plots to bill state agencies for safety net services that were never provided — have cost taxpayers several billion dollars, according to Mr. Thompson.

After new facets of the investigation came to light this fall, the scandal became a major crisis for Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who has struggled to explain why so much money was stolen on his watch.

But this month, facing threats and investigations from federal agencies, the governor suspended his campaign. Mr. Walz said he concluded that the work of rooting out fraud demanded his entire attention during the final year of his term, which will end shortly after the end of this year.

Mr. Walz lamented Mr. Thompson’s resignation on Tuesday, calling him “a principled public servant who spent more than a decade achieving justice for Minnesotans.” He added: “It’s also the latest sign Trump is pushing nonpartisan career professionals out of the justice department, replacing them with his sycophants.”

Mr. Thompson’s departure is a major blow to the effort.

(January 13, 2026)—Today, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem demanding records and information about the hiring of individuals connected to the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol and the use of face coverings by federal law enforcement officers to hide their identities.

“We know that some participants in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol have been rewarded with high-ranking positions in the Department of Justice (DOJ). However, it remains unclear how many more have been invited to join the ranks of this Administration, including among the masked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents and officers that have dragged, tackled, beaten, tased, shot, and killed citizens and non-citizens alike in communities around the country,” wrote Ranking Member Raskin.

Earlier this month, Ranking Member Raskin and House Judiciary Committee Democrats released a report documenting the careers of individuals involved in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election who are now employed in senior roles within the DOJ and DHS.

For example, Jared Wise, a former Supervisory Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), stormed the Capitol on January 6. He threatened police and applauded violence against them, shouting: “Yeah, fuck them! Yeah, kill ‘em!” After President Trump issued a blanket pardon for January 6 rioters, Wise escaped accountability for two pending felony charges—civil disorder and assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers—plus four additional offenses, including unlawful entry. Today, Wise serves as senior adviser to the Deputy Attorney General, alongside fellow January 6 participant Ed Martin, now the U.S. Pardon Attorney and head of the DOJ Weaponization Working Group.

DHS appears to be actively courting pardoned January 6 participants. It has deployed white nationalist “dog whistles” in its recruitment campaign for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), seemingly targeting members of extremist militias—including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters—involved in the insurrection. The campaign launched with a $50,000 sign-on bonus, elimination of college degree requirements, and relaxed vetting standards.

Less than one year into Donald Trump’s second term, masked DHS agents and officers have terrorized communities, including more than 170 US citizens who have been detained. Unlike any other law enforcement agency or armed services branch, ICE officers conceal their identities by wearing masks and removing their names from uniforms. Last week, a masked ICE agent shot a mother of three(link is external) at point-blank range as she attempted to drive away from him.

“Who is hiding behind these masks? How many of them were among the violent rioters who attacked the Capitol on January 6 and were convicted of their offenses? The American people deserve to know how many of these violent insurrectionists have been given guns and badges by this Administration,” wrote Ranking Member Raskin.

Ranking Member Raskin is demanding that Bondi and Noem produce information on federal agents’ use of facial coverings to obscure their identities and provide information on all individuals employed by DOJ and DHS who have received or sought a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, or who have been charged or investigated in connection with the January 6, 2021 attack.",,N,,2026-01-13 21:57:21.825019

United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that hundreds of additional ICE agents would be deployed to the North Star State.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents made their way to central Minnesota this month, including St. Cloud.

As ICE agents and civilians clashed on Jan. 12 near the intersection of Third Street North and 33rd Avenue North in St. Cloud, some St. Cloud-area residents continue to keep an eye on where agents go next. Those interested in ICE activities are posting sightings online at iceout.org.

As of Jan. 13, there are unconfirmed civilian reports listed on iceout.org in St. Cloud, Clear Lake, Clearwater and Princeton. These civilian submissions typically disclose the time of the sighting, whether it is confirmed, what type of activity was observed and the uniform the agents were wearing.

There are several categories of sightings on iceout.org. Report types include observed, active and critical. Observed includes activities like eating or visiting a gas station, active includes questioning people and critical includes raids, according to the website.

Tensions with ICE agents have increased after an agent on Jan. 7 reportedly shot Renee Good, 37, in south Minneapolis. The shooting sparked protests across the country.

The website is often referred to as People Over Papers, according to the site, which is powered by the Pueblo Project Foundation.

""Our objective is to collect community-submitted information about possible ICE activity to help inform the public and raise awareness,"" the website's 'about us' section reads. ""All reports are reviewed by our moderator team before appearing on the map.""

Despite all iceout.org reports being reviewed by a moderator team, the website's organizers urge those using the platform to proceed with caution and ""cross-reference it with their local or state rapid response networks.""

What to know about Monday's clash in St. Cloud

Immigration agents reportedly tried to detain one individual midday near Star Market, 3425 Third Street N., according to state Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud. He said some people at the strip mall engaged with ICE agents. Putnam said he was at the scene to reduce tension.

“ICE came to collect one individual,” Putnam said. “The community responded.”

There were at least 65 ICE agents present and at least 50 civilians. Immigration officials reportedly pepper-sprayed individuals at the scene, including St. Cloud resident Ali Warsme. It was not disclosed as to what perpetuated the pepper spray.

”I was one of the first people who got sprayed,” Warsme said. “Luckily someone had milk, but my eyes are still irritated.""

St. Cloud Police Chief Jeffrey Oxton wrote in a statement that he was not initially aware of a federal operation taking place in St. Cloud on Monday. Oxton said the operation happened in the strip mall's parking lot. St. Cloud police assisted with crowd control.

On Monday night, a group of at least 25 protesters voiced frustrations about ICE agents in St. Cloud outside area hotels where they thought agents might be staying.

Immigration surge in Minnesota

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security deployed roughly 2,000 ICE agents to Minnesota earlier this month. That deployment started on Jan. 4, just days before Good's death. The DHS said the shooting was an act of self-defense by the agent, while local leaders, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, dispute that claim.

""They are already trying to spin this as an action of self defense,"" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference on Jan. 7. ""Having seen the video myself I want to tell everybody directly, that is bull----.""

United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that hundreds of additional ICE agents would be deployed to the North Star State.

USA TODAY reports that Minnesota and Illinois sued Noem on Monday. Officials in Minnesota want the DHS to stop deploying agents to the state, according to USA TODAY. While Illinois wants bar federal agents to stop tactics like excessive force, such as chemical agents.

Pending court approval, case will be fully and permanently resolved in Maryland’s favor

BALTIMORE, MD – Attorney General Anthony G. Brown today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss its appeal of the final judgment that permanently blocks the Trump administration’s effort to unlawfully impose immigration enforcement requirements on U.S. Department of Transportation grants and other funding that amount to more than $1 billion a year for Maryland. By dropping its appeal, the Trump administration submits to the lower court ruling, fully resolving the case in favor of Maryland and the 21 other states that sued the administration.

“The Trump administration’s unlawful actions threatened funding that keeps Marylanders safe and our State moving,” said Attorney General Brown. “Our lawsuit protected the federal resources that maintain our roads and bridges, support public transit, reduce deadly crashes, and ensure people can get to work, school, and their homes safely. Those investments are essential to Maryland’s economy, public safety, and daily life.

Maryland receives more than $1 billion a year in funding from the Department of Transportation to build and maintain vital travel infrastructure like the roads, highways, airways, and bridges that connect communities and carry their residents to their workplaces and homes. This includes the funding necessary to prevent fatal traffic accidents and stop drunk drivers; the funding to provide transit for seniors and those with disabilities; and the funding that protects and restores roads after environmental disasters like fires or flooding. Neither the purpose of these funding programs, nor the criteria that govern them, are in any way connected to immigration enforcement.

The Constitution is clear: Congress, not the President, decides how federal money is spent. And for decades, Congress has passed laws guaranteeing funding to states like Maryland to improve their roads and protect those who use them — funds that the federal government generally has by virtue of the taxes it receives from the people of Maryland and other states. Yet despite the constraints imposed by Congress and the Constitution, the Trump administration attempted to seize Congress’s power of the purse by imposing unlawful conditions on transportation funding. In doing so, the Trump administration violated two key principles that underlie the American system: agencies in the Executive Branch cannot act outside the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government is subject to strict limits when it seeks to use the spending power to influence states to adopt its preferred policies.

On November 4, 2025, the district court issued final judgment in favor of Maryland and the states that challenged this unlawful conduct, issuing an order permanently enjoining the Trump administration from unlawfully imposing the conditions and vacating the conditions across all U.S. Department of Transportation funding programs. In issuing its decision, the Court found that the Trump administration has “blatantly overstepped their statutory authority, violated the APA, and transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions. The Constitutions demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior.”

Illinois and Minnesota officials are separately suing the Trump administration over the enforcement tactics used by federal immigration agents.

The lawsuits seek broader limits on the conduct of immigration agents in both states.

It comes after last week’s fatal shooting of Minneapolis mother Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Following the shooting, Vice President JD Vance said the agent was “protected by absolute immunity.”

The Illinois lawsuit names Secretary of Homeland Security Kirsti Noem and Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, among others, as defendants. A spokesperson for DHS said the lawsuit is “baseless,” and that DHS looks forward to “proving that in court.”

Harold Krent, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, joined “Chicago Tonight” to discuss the lawsuits and the legality of immigration agents’ use of force.

Do immigration agents have absolute immunity?

“The vice president is simply wrong. There have been a number of cases and judicial pronouncements that say that the individuals are not absolutely immune, and no Supreme Court decision has ever held that. That being said, the road to a prosecution by a state official is tough, and obviously we’re not going to see a federal prosecution in this administration, but there could be a federal prosecution in a subsequent administration. There are some civil damages routes that are available as well. … There are some avenues available for some kind of accountability.”

Could the Illinois and Minnesota lawsuits clash with the Supremacy Clause?

“What Illinois and Minnesota are saying is that the use of these aggressive tactics, moving patrols, interrogations and the use of tear gas, is simply trying to bludgeon the states into changing their form of government, which is also protected under the Constitution in our 10th Amendment. What these lawsuits are saying is that this use of aggressive tactics is trying to brow-beat the states into abandoning their sanctuary policies to protect migrants within the communities, and that the use of tactics to affect that aim is actually itself a violation of the Constitution because of the rights protected by the 10th Amendment of the Constitution.”
