What we know about fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis What is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?","The killing of a second US citizen in less than a month during immigration raids in Minneapolis has sparked angry protests and widespread condemnation.

Hundreds of demonstrators braved freezing weather to take to the streets over the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, during a confrontation on Saturday.

Videos from the scene show the scuffle between federal officers and Pretti. Federal and state authorities have offered conflicting versions of what happened in the moments leading to the shooting.

Trump ordered federal agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants.

The Trump administration has described Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist"".

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said he was there ""to perpetuate violence"", saying he approached federal agents with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun.

Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man just before the shooting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti resisted their attempts to disarm him.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading ""sickening lies"" about what happened.

BBC Verify analysed multiple videos showing the moments just before the shooting. They show Pretti filming agents with his mobile phone. One of the agents pushes another person over, and Pretti then stands between that person and the agent.

The agent pepper-sprays him in the face and, as he tries to help the woman on the ground, more agents join and he is wrestled to the ground. None of the available videos shows Pretti holding a gun.

An agent in a grey jacket can be seen empty-handed as he reaches to remove something from Pretti's waist. He then turns away from Pretti, now holding what appears to be a pistol in his right hand.

Less than a second after this, an agent shoots Pretti. Ten shots are heard.

If you are in Minneapolis, please share your story

In filed testimony, two witnesses challenged the DHS account of what happened, both saying they did not see Pretti brandish a weapon.

But Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the videos were unclear and ""there is a lot we don't see"" in them so it was important to have an investigation.

President Donald Trump said local and state officials were ""inciting Insurrection"", suggesting they had called off local police from protecting federal immigration officers at the shooting scene.

Governor Walz strongly disputed the federal government's account of the incident. ""I've seen the video from several angles and it's sickening,"" he told reporters.

""Thank God we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It is nonsense, and it's lies,"" he said

Walz reiterated his call for trump to end ICE operations in Minnesota and urged protests to remain peaceful.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also called for ICE agents to leave the state. ""How many more residents, how many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?"" he said.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/92fd/live/6c9d8a20-f9eb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:06:25.202115

Trump agrees to 'look into' pulling some ICE agents out of Minnesota, says Walz's office

We have more on the phone call that took place today between Donald Trump and Minnesota governor Tim Walz, which we covered per Trump’s perspective earlier.

According to a statement from Walz’s office, the two held a “productive” call where the president “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”.

Trump also agreed to talk to the Department of Homeland Security “about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case”, the statement says.

Per my colleague Hugo Lowell, Trump’s call with Walz comes amid widening public backlash to the aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota, which could be compounded with further bad news if a federal judge finds as early as today that Operation Metro Surge was broadly illegal.

The day so far

Good afternoon and thank you for reading our live coverage today.

Most of Monday’s political news stems from the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s death at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this weekend. State officials are trying to stop Donald Trump’s deployment of 3000 immigration agents to Minneapolis. Some local law enforcement are claiming that the feds are already blocking investigation of Pretti’s killing.

Here is a quick recap of where things stand.

Two federal judges are weighing cases that involve the legality of federal agents’ activity in Minneapolis. One case, which was argued this morning, challenged the legality of this surge. Another case, which will be argued at 2 pm local time, involves local officials’ claims that federal agents are getting in the way of their investigation of Pretti’s death.

Donald Trump is sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota on Monday night. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” the president said in a Truth Social post.

Chris Madel, an up-and-coming Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota, dropped out of the race because of the GOP’s “stated retribution on the citizens of our state.” In what the Minnesota Star Tribune described as a “stunning exit,” Madel also said: “United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong.” That Madel said this is, in fact, stunning: He provided legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who earlier this month shot and killed Renee Good.

Chuck Schumer, Senate Democratic leader, ramped up his request to separate Department of Homeland Security funding from a six-bill package. “Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,” Schumer said in a statement. “The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans… If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office said in a statement that he and Trump had a “productive” phone call where the president “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”. In the statement, Walz’s team said Trump agreed to talk with the Department of Homeland Security about making sure the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to investigate.

In Maine, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has arrested “more than 200 illegal aliens” in the past five days, assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Guardian in a statement.

Once again, DHS said that it was targeting the “worst of the worst” but highlighted the same four arrests of immigrants with criminal convictions that it shared when the immigration enforcement operation started last week in the Pine Tree state.

Department of justice fights court order requiring federal agents to preserve evidence in Alex Pretti's death

Trump administration officials are fighting a court order issued late Saturday that requires federal agents to preserve evidence in Alex Pretti’s death.

The temporary restraining order stemmed from a request from the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension (MBCA) and Hennepin county attorney’s office. They alleged that feds had stymied their investigative efforts of Pretti’s death at the hands of federal agents.

Trump’s justice department claimed in court papers that they “fail to establish that they will be irreparably harmed absent a temporary restraining order”.

They claim that federal agents “are already obligated to preserve the evidence at issue here under their own policies”.

They contend that the FBI gathered evidence from the scene of Pretti’s death “using appropriate collection and handling procedures, and that evidence is currently preserved and stored in a secure evidence room at the Minneapolis field office”.

“The evidence is being preserved; nothing has been destroyed or altered. [Customs and Border Protection] has preserved all relevant body-worn camera footage from the incident and will do so for 75 years.” They also said that ICE was in possession of “limited evidence and follows stringent requirements for the documentation, retention, and accountability of its investigative records and evidence”.

The justice department insists that Minnesota and Minneapolis officials don’t have a right to steer the feds’ evidence-handling procedures, “particularly procedures involving an immigration-enforcement incident”.

A court hearing on the TRO is scheduled for 2pm local time.

White House insists that Trump supports second amendment rights

Leavitt says, “The president supports the second amendment rights of law abiding American citizens. Absolutely.”

She goes on to caveat this by repeating the administration’s suggestions that Alex Pretti, who was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, was at fault. [A reminder that Pretti had a gun on his person but video footage shows he was holding his phone, not a weapon, when he was confronted by law enforcement.]

Leavitt says:

There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J Trump. So while Americans have a constitutional right to bear arms, Americans do not have a constitutional right to impede lawful immigration enforcement operations. And as any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk, and the risk of a force being used against you. And again, that’s unfortunately what took place on Saturday.

Updated at 14.04 EST

Leavitt is asked how many shots were fired, how many guns were discharged, and whether Alex Pretti’s gun went off or only the federal agents’ guns.

She says the investigation is ongoing and includes interviews with the agents involved.

Noem still has Trump's 'utmost confidence and trust' and continues to oversee DHS, says White House

Leavitt is asked if Tom Homan’s deployment to Minnesota should be taken as a sign that Trump is “dissatisfied” with the officials on the ground who handled the incident.

Leavitt says, “No,” adding that Kristi Noem “still has the [president’s] utmost confidence and trust” and says Noem is continuing to oversee the Department of Homeland Security and immigration enforcement across the country.

White House says CBP 'won't be needed' in Minnesota if Walz and Grey comply with anti-immigration measures

“That’s why President Trump spoke with Governor Walz directly this morning, and he has outlined a clear and simple path to restoring law and order in Minnesota,” Leavitt says.

Number one, governor Wallace, Mayor Frey and all Democrat leaders should turn over all criminal illegal aliens currently incarcerated in their prisons and jails to federal authorities along with any illegal aliens with active warrants or known criminal histories for immediate deportation.

Number two, state and local law enforcement must agree to turn over all illegal aliens who are arrested by local police.

And then thirdly, local police must assist federal law enforcement in apprehending and detaining illegal aliens who are wanted for crimes, especially violent crimes.

If Governor Walz and Mayor Frey implement these common sense, cooperative measures, that I will add, have already been implemented in nearly every single other state across the country, Customs and Border Protection will not be needed to support Ice on the ground in Minnesota.

Leavitt goes on to accuse Walz and Frey of “using their platforms to encourage leftwing agitators to stalk, record, confront and obstruct federal officers who are just trying to lawfully perform their duties”.

This, she claims, “has created dangerous situations, threatening both these officers and the general public and Minnesotans alike”.

“This is precisely what unfolded in Minneapolis on Saturday morning,” she adds.

Updated at 13.35 EST

“But let’s be clear about the circumstances which led to that moment on Saturday,” Leavitt goes on.

This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota for weeks. Governor Walz and the mayor, Jacob Frey, and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal, illegal aliens from our streets.

Leavitt says Saturday’s [fatal] shooting [of Alex Pretti] remains under active investigation by the FBI, homeland security and customs border officials.

“The administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” she says.

Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that state violence must be judged by the conditions that make it normal, not merely by the individuals who carry it out.
Sending armed agents into neighborhoods without adequate training is not an accident—it is policy.
King did not respond to state violence by asking for better public relations or gentler rhetoric.
If he were alive today, he would not ask ICE to behave more humanely while carrying out inhumane policies.","I was thirteen when I watched the Rodney King beating on the evening news with my father. The grainy footage was relentless and impossible. I credit that evening as my political awakening. I asked countless questions and received hours of patient answers. What has stayed with me is not only the horror of what was shown, but the collective astonishment that accompanies recurring episodes of graphic violence. The lesson in outrage is familiar: society confronts violence only when the public bears witness to its spectacular and undeniable reality.

In 1944, at age 15, returning by bus from an oratorical contest in Dublin, Georgia. King and his teacher, Mrs. Bradley, were seated when white passengers boarded. The bus driver enforced the cruelty of Jim Crow laws and ordered Black passengers—including King—to give up their seats. He stood up and obeyed the unjust law. He later described this moment as one of the angriest of his life, saying he was “the angriest I have ever been in my life,” and that the humiliation stayed with him for years. We all have memories that imprint into our souls.

Seeing ICE terrorize neighborhoods and detain innocent people—citizens and noncitizens alike—should be as morally jarring as “whites only” counters, hospitals, and water fountains once were. It is the kind of injustice that, when explained plainly, still shocks the conscience—especially of children, who have not yet learned to treat cruelty as normal. It will not be forgotten anytime soon.

Recent events make clear that this is not an aberration. In the past week alone, federal officials have doubled down on an enforcement strategy that prioritizes speed, visibility, and volume over preparation or restraint. The resulting violence is treated as unfortunate fallout rather than foreseeable consequence. That framing is not just misleading—it is false. What we are witnessing is not a failure of execution, but the execution of a plan.

I feel the cycle repeating. Shock, grief, and calls for accountability emerge immediately. One case involves police officers beating a limp body: another, a federal agent firing “defensive” shots through a driver’s-side window. King’s experience of racist America and our observations of 5-year-olds abducted in their driveways are the same; the state makes excuses, talks about the law, and blames victims. Coverage fixates on physical details, evidence, and personal histories.

Public violence demands resistance—it is part of our moral economy—but the selectivity of that attention is troubling. We are fluent in responding to abrupt emergencies and far less equipped to confront the slow boil of cultural and structural violence. King would praise the whistles in Minnesota while condemning the dog whistles from MAGA republicanism.

We should trust our eyes. There is nothing “self-defense” about the ICE shootings, and the administration’s claims that the victims are domestic terrorists (or anything else) are false. But the fatal shots were delivered months earlier, when the administration intentionally produced predictable suffering. Who did this? Why?

The answer is not found at the moment a trigger is pulled. It begins earlier, in offices where executive orders are drafted, training timelines shortened, and numerical targets elevated over human judgment. When preparation is compressed, oversight weakened, and escalation rewarded, violence is no longer accidental—it is structural. The question is not whether harm will occur, but who will be blamed when it does. When “defensive shots” were fired, again, in the morning hours of Jan. 24th Governor Walz responded: “Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”

Focus will be rightly placed on questions like, he was on the ground, how is that defensive? But how did thousands of agents of the state end up there? How is it that 85% of MAGA Republican and 64% of non-MAGA Republicans say ICE is “Just Right” or “Not Aggressive Enough?” Will there be another clear cover up?

Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that state violence must be judged by the conditions that make it normal, not merely by the individuals who carry it out. He resisted narrowing moral judgment to individual perpetrators because doing so allowed institutions to deflect responsibility onto “bad apples.” Decades of promises about body cameras and training have served as distractions from administrative recklessness and policy design. In what society, King would ask, is this behavior considered normal?

In Beyond Vietnam, King warned that a society reveals its moral commitments not through slogans, but through budgets and policy. A nation that “continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift,” he argued, “is approaching spiritual death.” The same logic applies here: priorities hardened into legislation produce predictable harm. As King put it, “We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values.”

This outcome was produced by an administration that turned neighborhoods into war zones for political purposes. Choosing escalation at every opportunity yields predictable results. Bureaucracy and executive orders kill far more effectively than individuals animated by avarice or malice. Valuing order over justice and privileging loyalty over morality is no longer an inflection point; it is openly rewarded.

This violence is bureaucratic before it is physical. Sending armed agents into neighborhoods without adequate training is not an accident—it is policy. Calling resulting deaths “failures” or “oversights” sanitizes decisions made in advance, for political gain, at the expense of human life. ICE in 2026 resembles the Birmingham Police Department in 1963. Kristi Noem and Bull Connor share the same playbook of state power suppressing dissent through intimidation and force. When 5,000 children walked out of school to protest segregation, Connor unleashed snarling dogs and fire hoses. Many children carried toothbrushes, knowing arrest was likely.

In the margins of a newspaper, King penned Letter from Birmingham Jail. Denied proper writing implements while held in solitary confinement, he wrote on scraps of paper—napkins and toilet paper among them. His message on the urgency of nonviolent direct action could not wait. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” he wrote, calling on people to break unjust laws and accept the consequences.

Donald Trump has not pulled the trigger, but his immigration policies cause needless pain, suffering, and death. They are grossly unpopular: a 2025 PRRI survey reports that only three in ten Americans support his immigration agenda. That unpopularity helps explain the strong reactions from neighbors, friends, and community members. Training adds another layer of risk. What once took roughly five months has been reduced to forty-seven days. Increased operational complexity paired with reduced preparation is a recipe for disaster. If a parent gives a four-year-old a gun, they are blamed. When an administration sends undertrained agents into the streets, it should be blamed as well.

All elected officials must be held to account. Softened language—“accidents happen” or “nothing we could do”—lets everyone off the hook. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did not mince words, telling ICE, “Get the F___ out!” Leaders can defund reckless operations, demand proper training, and insist on accountability. Citizens deserve competence, not excuses. Split-second decisions about detention and lethal force unfold in real time; adequate preparation is essential to protect both civilians and agents.

Cutting corners to staff the streets was a bureaucratic choice driven by headlines and numbers. Policies and procedures are violent in themselves, and they can be reversed—but that reality is missing from much of the coverage. Armed agents terrorizing neighborhoods is a serious problem, but focusing only on those who pull the trigger will not prevent future harm. Real change requires confronting the policies that put those agents and their weapons in neighborhoods in the first place.

King was a moral authority and a tactician, but above all, he was a man of action. In 2026, he would make clear that ICE is not part of the promise of any American Dream. The promise of opportunity revoked by a society that blocks justice while demanding law and order, King repeatedly warned, creates the conditions under which violence becomes more likely—not because people are impatient, but because justice has been systematically denied.

King did not respond to state violence by asking for better public relations or gentler rhetoric. He demanded disruption. He organized boycotts, marches, and mass refusal. He forced institutions to confront the cost of maintaining unjust systems. If he were alive today, he would not ask ICE to behave more humanely while carrying out inhumane policies. He would demand that those policies be stopped—and he would insist that elected officials choose between order and justice, knowing they cannot have both.

Structural violence is slow, often invisible, and lethal. Spectacle cannot be our measure of accountability. To prevent harm, we must confront not just bullets, but bureaucracy—the policies and political calculations that set violence in motion. Only then can outrage become action: defunding reckless operations, restoring meaningful training, and rejecting policies that treat communities as testing grounds for political theater.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bradley-andrews-18BAb3kNsGY-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:06:46.932277

The lawsuit seeks to have the deployment of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis declared unconstitutional.

The action follows the fatal shooting of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in the Minneapolis area.

Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, along with dozens of other cities around the country, has sided with Minneapolis in a federal lawsuit seeking to have immigration officials removed from that city in the wake of the fatal shootings of a Minnesota mother and an ICU nurse.

The brief, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, was authored by attorneys for the city of Boston and co-signed by attorneys from 80 other cities and local governments across the country.

Minneapolis is asking a federal judge to rule that the deployment of federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection is unconstitutional.

Klein's announcement comes on the same day a hearing was held in a federal court in Minnesota about the state's lawsuit. As of 1 p.m. EST, no ruling had been issued in the case.

The Trump administration has sent about 3,000 federal immigration officers to Minnesota as part of ""Operation Metro Surge."" The officers were mainly deployed to the Minneapolis and St. Paul areas. Since their deployment, two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot by agents, and there have been increasing protests in the city related to their continued presence.

""What we're seeing in the Twin Cities is horrific, heartbreaking and more of the same illegal and unconstitutional tactics from the Trump-Vance administration that seemingly cares more about retribution than the rule of law,"" Klein said in a release. ""Two people have now been shot and killed in the streets, local governments are under threat, and residents continue to have to worry about federal agents upending their daily lives.""

Federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse for the Veterans Administration, on Jan. 24. Pretti's death came after the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, also 37, by an ICE agent.

Klein has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration and its decisions, filing or joining a number of federal lawsuits, including those challenging cuts to local funding that had already been appropriated by Congress and access to healthcare.

Mayor Andrew Ginther said in a statement he supports Klein's actions in co-signing the supportive brief in Minnesota, saying federal agents ""lack the training and standards that we hold our own police to.""

Since the start of President Trump’s second term, Alex Pretti is the fifth person to be shot and killed be federal immigration officers. Federal immigration agents have fired weapons at civilians in at least 19 documented incidents as part of the administration’s enforcement crackdown. We demand accountability and an end to this cycle of sanctioned violence.

These deaths demonstrate a broader pattern of lawlessness, lack of accountability, and erosion of civil rights under the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). What we are witnessing is not isolated misconduct but the normalization of a federalized, unaccountable police force operating with impunity in American cities. This is the infrastructure of authoritarianism taking root in real time.

Let us be clear: the violence federal immigration agents are bringing into Minneapolis sits within a long American tradition of state power used to surveil, control, and punish Black and Brown communities. But the scale and brazenness of this moment mark a dangerous escalation. This is a humanitarian crisis. This is a civil rights crisis. This is a constitutional crisis.

Federal obstruction of independent investigations has made matters worse. State officials and local law enforcement agencies have faced repeated resistance and continue to be denied meaningful access to evidence and crime scenes necessary to conduct full and transparent reviews and investigations. When governors and attorneys general cannot investigate deaths in their own states, accountability has collapsed.

These egregious acts by federal agents are in defiance of the rule of law and require Congress’ immediate action. Instead of empowering ICE and DHS with billions of additional dollars in new funding, we call on every U.S. Senator to vote NO on any legislation that funds ICE or DHS surveillance, intelligence, and enforcement operations, and we formally request immediate meetings within 48 hours with both the Senate Democratic Caucus and Senate Republican Caucus regarding the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the urgent need for congressional intervention.

This Congress has abdicated its oversight role, allowing immigration enforcement to grow into the largest law enforcement force in the country, with devastating human costs. The Senate must act now. Further funding without accountability is further abdication of your responsibility.

What I saw will haunt me forever. | Opinion - USA Today,Patty O'Keefe,,,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2026/01/26/ice-detained-us-citizens-minnesota-arrests/88304880007/,"Imagine if you heard that heavily armed, masked agents were going door-to-door where you live, violently grabbing people from gardeners to grandparents – no questions asked, no warrants offered.

When we drove to the scene, Brandon and I saw several ICE agents getting back into two unmarked vehicles.

These women said they enlisted for the same reason they felt compelled to act as ICE observers – to protect their fellow Americans.","I live smack dab in the middle of an ordinary block in Minneapolis. I borrow occasional eggs or vanilla from the neighbor on my right when I get caught short baking. My partner shovels our elderly neighbor’s sidewalk; she knit him a hat in gratitude. The folks down the street watch our cats when we’re away. In other words, a pretty typical American neighborhood, perhaps not unlike your own.

Imagine if you heard that heavily armed, masked agents were going door-to-door where you live, violently grabbing people from gardeners to grandparents – no questions asked, no warrants offered. What would you do? Especially if you knew that having more community members as observers decreases the likelihood those masked agents will use violence.

That’s what my friend Brandon and I were doing on Jan. 11. We heard reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pepper spraying the car of an observer blocks from my house and went to warn others. I am a U.S. citizen and resident of Minneapolis for more than 14 years; this is a place where treating others as you wish to be treated is more than a saying.

When we drove to the scene, Brandon and I saw several ICE agents getting back into two unmarked vehicles. They turned down a side street and we followed for about 40 seconds, blowing our whistles and honking our horns – to warn our neighbors that ICE had come.

We did so knowing that monitoring and sounding the alarm about actions undertaken by government agents is our legally protected right. And any government that claims to be of, by and for the people must protect this right, not attack people of good conscience who exercise it.

But attack us is what ICE did. The agents got out of their vehicle, surrounded our car and yelled at us to stop following. On their way back to their vehicles, one of the agents suddenly turned around, as if deciding, “Hey, why not,” and walked back to my car and pepper sprayed into the vents near the front windshield.

'You guys gotta stop obstructing us – that's why that lesbian b---- is dead'

Brandon and I were paralyzed with shock, as our eyes and throats started to burn. When we did not immediately turn the car around, the ICE agents returned and, without warning or asking us to exit the vehicle, smashed the front windows of my car, dragged us out and arrested us.

They separated us. I was put in a car alone with three agents. When they got in and shut the doors, the taunting began.

One agent took a photo of me and showed it to the others, laughing. Another called me ugly. His colleague, apparently referring to Renee Good, said, “You guys gotta stop obstructing us – that’s why that lesbian b---- is dead.” In the presence of these masked men with weapons strapped to their bodies – men who claim to be safeguarding our cities – I felt only terrorized and vulnerable.

When we got to the Whipple Federal Building, they shackled my ankles. I asked four times to make a phone call but was denied that legal right. I had to beg for water and to be allowed to relieve myself in another crowded cell with a toilet behind a short wall.

On my way to that cell, I passed holding cells filled with people who appeared to be of Latino and East African descent. The despondent faces and the screaming, wailing and pleading from these men, women and children – reportedly as young as 5 years old – will forever haunt me. But perhaps more haunting still was the sound of agents nearby laughing. Are our lives all just a joke to them?

Eight hours later, I was released without charges because even these agents had no credible claim I had done anything wrong.

ICE is arresting people without cause. We can stand up to tyranny.

President Donald Trump and his administration spread lies about our neighbors based on what they look like or how they speak, all while making us less safe.

In the Twin Cities alone, we’ve seen people arrested without cause while doing their jobs and a grandfather pulled out of the shower and taken into the freezing cold in nothing but his underwear and a blanket. Local schools were forced to cancel classes after ICE tackled staff and tear gassed students, according to the teachers union, while raiding Roosevelt High School.

These actions endanger us. They are designed to terrorize our community with unchecked, unaccountable brutality.

When ICE detained me, the two other people in my cell said they were Marine Corps veterans. These women said they enlisted for the same reason they felt compelled to act as ICE observers – to protect their fellow Americans.

One of those veterans – scraped up and bruised at both wrist and ankle from the ICE agents’ aggression – talked about how ironic and shocking it was that the first time she had a gun pointed at her it was by the very government she swore an oath to serve.

I’m lucky to be back at home; I can return to my job, the people I love and my community. The hundred or so people I saw in that ICE facility may never again see the homes that they’ve built and the families they’ve nurtured. After being killed by Border Patrol and ICE in the past 12 months, Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Keith Porter and dozens of others who died in custody are only memories to their families. And our Twin Cities remain under siege by masked militia answering to a regime that spreads lies and sows fear in order to divide us and distract us while its leaders gut our health care, drive up prices and hand more money to their billionaire backers.

But in the United States of America, people who believe in liberty and justice for all stand up to tyranny. We sound the alarm. We support our neighbors. Now is the time for us to join together. And to tell Congress to protect our freedoms by refusing to fund these assaults against us.

Bondi’s letter marked the first time that the Trump administration implicitly tied its immigration enforcement actions to its quest for voters’ data.
Over the past month and a half, the Trump administration has sent over 3,000 federal agents to the state.
The department also said the state had no right to challenge the enforcement of federal immigration law.
Menendez is also overseeing a class-action lawsuit by Minneapolis residents challenging the aggressive tactics federal immigration agents have used against protesters, legal observers and members of the media.","Minnesota state attorneys alleged in a court hearing Monday that President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are attempting to force the state to surrender its sovereignty — in particular, its control over elections — through the massive federal immigration operation in the Twin Cities region.

In the hearing, the state attorneys presented the letter Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Gov. Tim Walz (D) over the weekend as evidence of the Trump administration’s extortion campaign against Minnesota.

In that letter, Bondi demanded that the state make multiple concessions, including forfeiting its voter registration records, to the federal government in order to “restore the rule of law.” Bondi sent the letter on the same day that federal Border Patrol agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis while he was acting as a legal observer of immigration operations.

While the attorney general didn’t explicitly claim that the Trump administration would end its aggressive immigration raids if the state complied with her demands, Minnesota officials have interpreted the letter as Bondi leveraging the chaos unleashed by federal agents to extract concessions from the state.

“It’s a shakedown letter,” Brian Scott Carter of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office argued in court Monday in a hearing over the state’s lawsuit to end the Trump administration’s ongoing aggressive immigration raids there. “That’s what you expect from someone who is extorting you.”

Among her demands, Bondi ordered the state to give the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division access to Minnesota’s unredacted voter rolls, part of the department’s broader campaign to access American voters’ confidential personal data under the false pretext of rooting out widespread election fraud. For weeks, the department has sought Minnesota’s voter data — and data from several other states — but has largely done so through legal threats.

Bondi’s letter marked the first time that the Trump administration implicitly tied its immigration enforcement actions to its quest for voters’ data.

The attorney general also demanded that the state give the Trump administration’s data on its Medicaid and supplementary food assistance programs, end “sanctuary policies” and actively devote its own law enforcement resources to supporting the immigration raids.

In its totality, the letter amounted to an assault on Minnesota’s sovereignty, demanding that it forfeit its ability to make and enforce its own laws and maintain its voter rolls without oversight from the executive branch, which does not have authority over elections.

Lindsey Middlecamp, another attorney arguing on behalf of the state Monday, described Bondi’s note as “a ransom note.”

“Their message is clear,” Middlecamp said. “Minnesota can change its laws and policies or suffer invasion of mass armed forces.”

The state has asked a federal judge to temporarily pause the immigration enforcement operation, arguing that it violates its Tenth Amendment rights by serving as the Trump administration’s primary tool to coerce the state politically.

Over the past month and a half, the Trump administration has sent over 3,000 federal agents to the state.

Alongside Bondi’s letter, Minnesota attorneys highlighted other statements and actions that they believe signal an ongoing extortion campaign against the state, including a recent social media post from Trump promising “a day of retribution” for Minnesota.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is presiding over the state’s lawsuit, largely agreed with the state attorneys that recent actions by the Trump administration, including the weekend’s fatal shooting, were deeply alarming. However, the judge also repeatedly warned that she was very limited in how she could grant the state immediate relief.

In its defense of the surge, the DOJ claimed that the operation wasn’t meant to force Minnesota to change its policies but to “make up for harms caused” by its policies. The department also said the state had no right to challenge the enforcement of federal immigration law.

Menendez appeared skeptical of the department’s defense, saying that Bondi’s letter suggested a “quid pro quo.” She also noted that the state was challenging a single law enforcement operation and not the enforcement of immigration law in general.

The judge said a ruling on the state’s request “might take time” before adjourning Monday’s hearing.

Menendez is also overseeing a class-action lawsuit by Minneapolis residents challenging the aggressive tactics federal immigration agents have used against protesters, legal observers and members of the media.

Earlier this month, she ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol could not detain or use tear gas against people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Menendez’s order in that lawsuit last week.

The killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol over the weekend unleashed another wave of unrest across the state. Pretti’s death came just over two weeks after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old mother-of-three Renee Good.

Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens who were observing the actions of federal agents before their deaths.

Hours after Pretti’s death, Bondi promoted her letter to Walz on Fox News Sunday. She said she sent the letter Sunday in order to demand that the governor “better support President Trump.”

“He better support the men and women in law enforcement because if he doesn’t, we are, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” Bondi claimed.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257959135-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:07:08.285756

With the second murder of a Minneapolis citizen at the hands of untrained, immunity-drunk, and predatory federal agents, Democrats must fundamentally shift their approach to immigration policy. It’s long past time for the party to move past its learned helplessness in the face of MAGA bloodlust fantasies about an invading horde of undocumented immigrants—and to vindicate the human rights of workers and neighbors confronting Gestapo-style seizures, renditions, and executions of a lawless invading force. Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old VA nurse shot 11 times in the back after being thrown to the ground by federal goons, was documenting their abuses in the hopes of halting them and returning our federal government to some semblance of moral responsibility. The bare minimum that national Democrats can do in his memory is to dismantle the ICE bureaucracy of terror once and for all.

After Pretti’s execution on Saturday, a key swing bloc of Senate Democrats had signaled that they would vote no on the House-passed appropriations bill that would deliver $10 billion in additional funding for ICE. This is on top of the tripling of the agency’s budget secured in last summer’s tax-and-spending bill. House GOP leaders had already carved out the ICE appropriation into a separate bill funding the Department of Homeland Security, so that another swing bloc of right-leaning Democrats would support it after a number of their pet spending priorities were attached to the legislation. That tactic was also garnering support from Democratic senators, with Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray of Washington all but assuring that Republicans would land the seven Democratic votes required to avoid a filibuster. Yet now that the feds have murdered another Minneapolis resident, Democratic support for the measure has collapsed, leaving GOP majority leader John Thune with the option of either blowing up the filibuster or stripping out DHS funding as a standalone bill that wouldn’t clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold, and thereby potentially touching off a partial government shutdown.

In material terms, the Senate vote wouldn’t do much to slow down the rampaging ICE invasions, given the agency’s vast $85 billion annual budget; ICE continued its marauding national tour during last year’s record-long government shutdown after all. But in political terms, the Democrats must not sidestep this battle. Democrats had previously relied on strong polling support for Trump’s immigration views to rationalize their passivity on the issue—yet public opinion is turning against ICE. A YouGov poll released on Saturday, hours before Pretti’s execution, showed 46 percent of all respondents backing the agency’s abolition, compared to 41 percent opposing it. The gap widens to 12 percent among independent voters—now the largest segment of the electorate—with 47 percent backing ICE’s abolition, and 35 percent opposing. Fifty-percent of respondents said they strongly disapprove of ICE, and just 24 percent of independents registered support for the agency. There’s every reason to believe that these negative numbers will continue to grow in the wake of Pretti’s horrific murder.

As political scientist David Faris recently argued in The Nation—again, prior to Pretti’s killing—Democrats cannot continue their dilatory enabling role in backing the rise of an immigration police state:

If the party can’t take a stand here for their own voters in the Twin Cities and elsewhere who are effectively living under an open-ended, vengeful military occupation, it may fritter away what looks like a decisive advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. Many Democratic voters now keen to have the party begin the long fight to reclaim basic constitutional protections and democratic traditions shredded by the Trump regime would be discouraged from turning out this November if the party refuses to meet this latest crisis with anything other than polite consultant-massaged demands to institute improved training protocols for ICE goons poised to terrorize our cities.

Unfortunately, the political exigency here stands athwart a dismal Democratic record of preserving status-quo state predation in immigration policy. Over the past decade of xenophobic immigrant-baiting on the right, the leaders of the Democratic Party have adopted their standard difference-trimming playbook to an issue that was always a stark question of basic human rights and basic human decency. The MAGA claim that the United States was in the grip of a violent immigrant crime wave was a blatant lie, as were scores of related dehumanizing slurs, from the nonsensical assertion that immigrants were bankrupting Social Security and health coverage to the urban legend that Haitian immigrants were eating the pets belonging to their neighbors in Springfield, Ohio. (Indeed, the ICE mobilization in Minneapolis is in response to another discredited battery of MAGA lies about a massive scheme of welfare fraud allegedly perpetrated by Somali-run daycare centers in Minnesota—though just how an armed Freikorps mobilization is expected to combat the accounting-based conduct of welfare fraud has never been explained.)

Occasionally, Democratic lawmakers would try to swat down some of the right’s most lurid and baseless claims, but they also took great care to grant the basic premise of this hate campaign: that border enforcement in this country was broken and that some vast unspecified cohort of undocumented immigrants were, in some vague and implausible way, preying on the birthright safety and prosperity of native-born Americans. That’s why President Barack Obama oversaw a greater volume of deportations than Donald Trump had, prior to the present Trump administration’s mass deportation policy; it’s also why, once you combine interior removals of immigrants with administrative returns at or near the border, the Biden White House clocked a higher number of immigrants exiting the country in the first eight months of its final year than the second Trump administration has during the same time frame in 2025. It’s why Biden and his Democratic allies on the Hill continued increasing ICE’s budget lines. And it’s why the same Democratic Senate caucus now belatedly trying to stake out a dissenting position on state-sanctioned murder meekly rolled over to ensure the passage of the Laken Riley Act, which laid the groundwork for ICE’s rolling siege on Democratic-led cities.

The reasoning behind the House appropriations bid to continue spiking ICE funding is very much of a piece with this long train of Democratic capitulations on right-wing immigration crackdowns: If the party once again submits to the right-wing consensus on immigration, it won’t suffer a defection of highly coveted (if increasingly mythical) moderate voters in the next election cycle.

But the flagrantly fascist actions of the Trump White House have upended even the milquetoast logic of traditional Democratic acquiescence. There’s no middle ground to be staked out in a murderous authoritarian siege. In addition to the dramatic shift against Trump’s immigration program in opinion surveys, there’s now a mass revulsion against ICE in unlikely forums like NFL Reddit boards. For a political establishment that’s spent the past decade bending over backward to accommodate the smallest errant grievance from Trump-voting diner patrons, that should be a five-alarm wake-up call.

And aside from self-interested electoral calculations, the moral case against allowing ICE to survive is now unanswerable. In a powerful YouTube video posted shortly after Pretti’s execution, New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie made the straightforward case that the administration’s concerted release of ideological death squads in US cities renders Trump’s presidency illegitimate. Bouie doesn’t cite manifestos from the margins of political life, but rather section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which forbids insurrectionists against the United States from holding federal office, and the language of the Declaration of Independence. That strikes me as a sound fundamental basis for the Democrats to finally act with genuine moral authority on a genuine moral issue.

The present crisis also calls to mind the counsel of Martin Luther King Jr. in “A Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” as he surveys the callow lecturing of his self-appointed Job’s consolers in the white moderate wing of liberalism. King wrote:

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s greatest stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jeffries-schumer-spine.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:58:34.109352

Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz has blamed “untrained” federal officers for the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.","Protests are continuing in Minnesota after federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis Saturday. He was an intensive care unit nurse in the Minneapolis Veterans Health Care System who was filming officers on his phone during a protest against President Trump’s immigration crackdown in the city. His killing comes just weeks after ICE agents fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three in Minneapolis, and after Friday’s demonstrations, where over 50,000 people took to the streets of downtown Minneapolis protesting against ICE as thousands of residents held a general economic strike.

Federal agents claimed that Pretti was a violent “gunman” who threatened to “massacre” law enforcement, but video evidence and witness statements directly contradict their account. Video footage shows Pretti being wrestled to the ground by several law enforcement officers before being shot 10 times in less than five seconds. The videos show Pretti coming to the defense of a woman who was shoved to the ground by a federal officer. The officer then sprays Pretti with a chemical agent, before tackling him to the street. Six agents surround Pretti on the ground, and at least one appears to fire at him at close range. They then step away from Pretti’s body, and one officer appears to fire six shots at Pretti’s motionless body. Pretti had no criminal record and had a legal permit to carry a firearm, which he never took out.

Pretti’s parents released a statement after his killing, saying, “We are heartbroken but also very angry. The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.”

The Department of Homeland Security has blocked local investigators from probing the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Protests erupted in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti’s killing.

Protester: “What we’ve seen is that the community has been talking to each other as real people, and these people have come in and been hurting us. They’ve been attacking us when we’ve been doing nothing but following the law, peacefully observing, and then they decide to gang up and kill one of us.”

NBC News is reporting that President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act to quell protests against ICE in Minneapolis. Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz has blamed “untrained” federal officers for the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Here’s Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “How many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values? How many times must local and national leaders must plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation?”

Meanwhile, the NRA issued a statement condemning the Trump administration’s claims that justified Pretti’s killing because he was carrying a weapon, saying, “This sentiment … is dangerous and wrong. Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”

The NBA postponed Saturday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors after federal agents shot and killed Pretti. The Timberwolves’ head coach Chris Finch denounced ICE’s killing of Pretti ahead of the game.

Chris Finch: “For the second time in less than three weeks, we’ve lost another beloved member of our community in the most unimaginable way. As an organization, we are heartbroken for what we are having to witness and endure and watch. And we just want to extend our thoughts, prayers and concern for Mr. Pretti.”

The NBA Players Association also released a statement saying, “Following the news of yet another fatal shooting in Minneapolis, a city that has been on the forefront of the fight against injustices, NBA players can no longer remain silent. Now more than ever, we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice.”",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/01/80701/full_hd/hd1-AlexPretti.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:58:39.562526

One such complication: The federal officer charged by state prosecutors for a crime committed while on duty could move any such case to a federal court.
If federal officers understood that they could and might well be held liable for outrageous conduct, they might think twice before engaging in it.","In the wake of another fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, many people are wondering what can be done. The answer has been right in front of us all along.

Despite the incredulity with which some legal observers meet the idea, state and local prosecutors can prosecute federal officials for violating state criminal laws. Prosecutors should be gathering and securing evidence and seriously considering filing charges — sooner rather than later.

Not every prosecution will succeed, and all will face obstacles that are built into our legal system. But critically, bringing these state and local prosecutions could produce deterrent effects that are so desperately needed now.

U.S. law, at least theoretically, provides a range of options for holding government officers accountable; the problem is that many of those options are unavailable in practice where federal officers are concerned.

Consider, for instance, federal criminal prosecution — which should be an option for federal officers who commit murder. As recently as 2019, the first Trump administration told the Supreme Court that federal criminal prosecution would be the appropriate remedy in cases in which an officer used lethal force without justification.

But the current administration didn’t investigate the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good, and it has already stated that the Department of Homeland Security (which has no experience investigating law enforcement shootings) will run the investigation into the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti. A future president could potentially pursue charges for an offense — like the recent shootings of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti — that has no statute of limitations. But that assumes President Trump won’t first pardon the responsible officer(s).

What’s more, a series of decisions by the Supreme Court has made it all but impossible to hold federal officers liable for damages in federal lawsuits for violating our constitutional rights — such as in a February 2020 decision involving a Border Patrol agent who shot and killed an unarmed teenager without provocation.

Instead, the historical backstop for a lack of federal accountability, going all the way back to the founding, has been state law. States prosecuting federal officers for crimes committed in the course of their federal duties would certainly face complications, but those hurdles would not be insurmountable.

One such complication: The federal officer charged by state prosecutors for a crime committed while on duty could move any such case to a federal court. But that would simply change the courthouse (and the judge and the jury pool). State prosecutors would still be seeking to enforce state law — which, among other things, means that any conviction would not be subject to the president’s pardon power.

A second potential hurdle to clear: A federal officer defendant could argue that he’s entitled to what’s known as “Supremacy Clause immunity.” Vice President JD Vance, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, have all claimed that this immunity is absolute, but they’re all wrong. As highly regarded (and conservative) former Judge Michael McConnell wrote on behalf of the Denver-based federal appeals court in 2006, “a federal officer is not entitled to Supremacy Clause immunity unless, in the course of performing an act which he is authorized to do under federal law, the agent had an objectively reasonable and well-founded basis to believe that his actions were necessary to fulfill his duties.”

In other words, the ability to prosecute federal law enforcement officers who commit state crimes in the course of their duties would turn on whether a reasonable officer in their position would have believed that their actions were necessary to fulfill their duties. That standard may be appropriately strict, to maintain federal authority when it is needed (think of federal protection for civil rights protesters in the 1960s), but at least based on the videos so many of us have seen, it should not be impossible.

Nor should state and local prosecutors think this power to bring charges under state law exists — or should exist — only when the offense results in a death. Every day, Americans are seeing an unending stream of videos showing federal officers destroying property, pepper-spraying individuals on a whim and using what at least appear to be excessive degrees of force. Many, if not most, of these acts are potential violations of state criminal laws. If those crimes are not “reasonable and well-founded” in light of federal duties, the officers can be convicted and penalized, even jailed.

What prosecutors should be doing now is what Minnesota prosecutors did after the murder of Renee Good: establishing online portals to which individuals can upload their videos and other evidence. Will there be a flood of evidence? Yes. Will it all justify prosecution? No. Will some offenders be charged? We can’t say for sure, but it looks to us like the answer ought to be yes, and that’s true even if the final result is not a conviction. (That, after all, is why we have trials and juries.)

If federal officers understood that they could and might well be held liable for outrageous conduct, they might think twice before engaging in it. The ultimate goal is bringing to justice those who have engaged in blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional conduct. But what is needed immediately — urgently — is deterring such conduct from happening going forward. Federal officers who are wearing masks to obscure their faces (and those who aren’t) must understand that they will be held accountable if and when they break the law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26friedman-vladeck-lptc/26friedman-vladeck-lptc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:05.409662

“Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “Separately, a major investigation is going on with respect to the massive 20 Billion Dollar, Plus, Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organised protests going on in the streets.”

“Additionally, the DOJ and Congress are looking at ‘Congresswoman’ Illhan Omar, who left Somalia with NOTHING, and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars. Time will tell all.”

Omar’s net worth has increased into the millions of dollars in recent years due to her husband’s wealth. Omar serves in the US House of Representatives, representing Minnesota.

Omar responds

The congresswoman hit back at Trump, accusing him of invoking her to distract from his dwindling popularity.

“Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing, and you’re panicking,” Omar wrote on X.

“Right on cue, you’re deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me. Years of ‘investigations’ have found nothing. Get your goons out of Minnesota.”

Previously, Trump had publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to open investigations into his political opponents.

Last week, Trump said Omar “should be investigated for Financial and Political Crimes, and that investigation should start, NOW”.

Omar, who is of Somali descent, is one of Trump’s favourite targets, and he often deploys Islamophobic language to attack her.

The Muslim American congresswoman has been a vocal critic of Trump’s policies and rhetoric, including his attacks against the Somali community.

After Trump attacked Omar and called the Somali community “garbage” last month, Omar accused him of having a “creepy” obsession with her.

“I hope he gets the help he desperately needs,” she said at the time.

In recent months, Trump has been incessantly bringing up Omar and the Somali community, seizing on a COVID-19-era welfare embezzlement scandal in Minnesota in which dozens of people, including some Somali immigrants, have been charged.

Late last year, Trump mocked Omar’s headscarf in one of his rants over Minnesota and its Democratic Governor Tim Walz, saying she is “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.

At the same time, the Trump administration launched an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that appeared to be targeting the state’s sizeable Somali community.

But immigration officers’ aggressive tactics in the state have generated nationwide condemnation. Early this month, a federal officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen and a mother of three, as she tried to flee immigration agents who had surrounded her car.

The Trump administration accused her of trying to ram the officer, but video footage cast doubt over that claim.

Then came the killing of Pretti, who was shot multiple times after a tussle with immigration agents. The White House described the victim as a “domestic terrorist” and said he was carrying a gun.

But videos shot from multiple angles showed Pretti had a phone in one hand while their other hand was raised and empty before the shooting.

Trump speaks to Walz

The killings of both Good and Pretti took place in Minneapolis, part of which is represented by Omar.

“I am absolutely horrified that federal agents are targeting and executing our residents instead of protecting them,” the congresswoman said in a statement on Saturday.

She called on federal immigration officers to leave the city and for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be impeached.

Later on Monday, Trump said he spoke to Minnesota Governor Walz and the two “seemed to be on a similar wavelength”.

“I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future.”

Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post on Sunday night comes as tensions escalate between anti-ICE protesters and federal immigration enforcement agents in the wake of over the weekend. Pretti is the second United States citizen to be killed by an ICE agent in Minnesota in just the past few weeks.

Trump blamed Democrat leadership, particularly Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for failing to “stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence,” which he said ultimately lead to the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good.

“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”

In a subsequent post, Trump made a list of demands on Democratic leadership including demanding Walz and Frey turn over all illegal aliens currently incarcerated, with an active warrant, or arrested by state and local law enforcement. He also requested that local police work with federal law enforcement “in apprehending and detaining Illegal Aliens who are wanted for Crimes.”

“Democrat Politicians must partner with the Federal Government to protect American Citizens in the rapid removal of all Criminal Illegal Aliens in our Country. Some Democrats, in places like Memphis, Tennessee, or Washington, D.C., have done so, resulting in safer streets for ALL,” Trump wrote.

Trump said all of his “requests are rooted in COMMON SENSE” and will ensure that Americans stay safe.

“The Trump Administration is standing by, and waiting for ANY Democrat to do the right thing, and work with us on these important matters of MAKING AMERICA SAFE like it is in all sections of our Country where we are, together with Local Leadership, participating and involved,” Trump wrote.

However, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CBS’ “Face The Nation” that “it’s not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement to hand folks over that are in jails.”

“The city police do not operate a jail that’s at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years,” O’Hara host Margaret Brennan on Sunday. “And I don’t know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.”",https://thenationaldesk.com/resources/media2/16x9/5590/986/0x292/90/67e70a87-f015-428b-8d15-6f922e0be3b6-GettyImages2257687936.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:59:05.690743

Walz and other Democratic leaders have fiercely opposed the immigration surge, which they characterize as a lawless invasion that puts public safety at risk. Trump, for his part, has spent the past month accusing Walz of incompetence for failing to stop a welfare-fraud scandal in the state.

Walz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump earlier said he would dispatch the White House border czar, Tom Homan, to work with local officials following Saturday's shooting of a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, by immigration agents during a confrontation with protesters in Minneapolis. While other top Trump officials have characterized Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist,"" Homan has not publicly spoken about the incident.

In a statement, Trump said Homan ""has not been involved"" in the Minnesota crackdown ""but knows and likes many of the people there.""

Trump's statements came as state officials pressed a U.S. judge to temporarily stop the surge of 3,000 immigration agents.

""This administration, your honor, is not content with the rule of law. They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. Instead, they put violence into the streets of Minnesota to get what they want,"" Brian Carter, a lawyer with the state attorney general's office, told U.S. Judge Katherine Menendez.

JUDGE QUESTIONS WHETHER SHE HAS AUTHORITY TO STOP OPERATION

Menendez, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, appeared skeptical of the state's argument that she had the power to shut down the operation on the grounds that it violates the state's sovereignty.

“I don't know how you are asking me to identify when the federal government has crossed the line,"" she told Carter.

Menendez asked a Trump administration lawyer if the federal government was seeking to coerce the state into changing its immigration policies by sending thousands of agents to Minneapolis.

“Is the executive trying to achieve a goal through force that it cannot achieve through the courts?” Menendez asked Trump administration lawyer Brantley Mayers. Mayers answered with a no, saying the administration was there to enforce federal immigration law.

Menendez concluded the hearing after nearly three hours of argument. She did not say when she would rule.

The surge of agents has spurred massive street protests in below-freezing temperatures, and fierce condemnations by the state's Democratic leaders. Sixty of the state's largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and U.S. Bancorp, called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration on Sunday.

REPUBLICAN BREAKS WITH PARTY, DROPS GOVERNOR BID

A leading Republican candidate for governor, Chris Madel, dropped his bid on Monday, saying the crackdown had gone too far and had made the race unwinnable for a Republican.

""I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,"" he said in a video statement.

Homeland Security Department officials have described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun.

But video from the scene, verified by Reuters, contradicts that account. The footage shows Pretti holding a phone -- not a gun -- as agents wrestle him to the ground. It also shows officers removing a firearm stored near his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will remain in her job ""with the full trust and confidence of the President,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that his administration is ""reviewing everything"" about the incident and said immigration officials would eventually withdraw.

Recent Reuters polling indicates that a significant slice of Trump's Republican backers - 39% - , saying harm should be minimized even if this means fewer immigration-related arrests.

In Washington, Democrats in the Senate have said they will oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, raising the likelihood of a partial government shutdown starting on Sunday. Republicans approved a massive budget increase for immigration enforcement last year, but some of them now are demanding answers from the Trump administration.

Our children are American citizens.","A U.S. Navy veteran and father expresses fear for his adopted Latino children due to the current climate surrounding immigration.

The author argues that current immigration enforcement actions threaten constitutional protections and have led to documented deaths.

He contends that recent visa bans and suspensions have negatively impacted international adoptions, leaving families in limbo.

Citing his Christian faith, the author calls for compassion for immigrants, contrasting current policies with the teachings of Jesus.

I love this country. I served in the U.S. Navy because I believed in what America stood for.

Today, as a father of American children, I can no longer stay silent.

This is personal.

This is about the Constitution.

This is about faith.

I never imagined I would feel this afraid for my children in the United States of America.

Love adopted American children

My wife and I adopted our Latino children after the death of our son, Jimmy. Our children are American citizens. They are American kids. They are loved. They are innocent. And today, they are scared because of what they see, what they hear, and what they feel happening in this country.

If I am being honest, I am scared for them, too.

I love this country.

In my younger years, I was a Ronald Reagan Republican. President Reagan inspired me to serve in the Navy because I believed in what our country stood for.

Reagan understood that America could be both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. In 1986, he signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants who had lived and worked here for years.

Reagan believed in accountability, but he also believed in legalization and eventual citizenship for families who had put down roots. He was not for mass deportation of neighbors who came here to work and raise families.

We are supposed to be the good guys.

What we are witnessing today is different.

Deaths, constitutional issues arise

There have been documented deaths during immigration enforcement actions, including cases involving U.S. citizens, serious enough that international human rights officials have urged the United States to investigate and uphold the rule of law. That alone should alarm every American, regardless of political affiliation.

We are also seeing increasing threats to Fourth Amendment protections. Immigration agents are relying more frequently on administrative warrants that are not signed by judges to enter homes. Legal experts have raised serious concerns that this practice undermines constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. When constitutional safeguards are weakened for one group, they are weakened for all.

This issue is deeply personal for my family.

Recent visa bans and suspensions affecting certain countries have had real consequences for international adoption. When immigrant visas are barred or paused for nationals of specific countries, children adopted by U.S. citizens from those countries are often unable to receive the visas required to enter this country.

While these policies may not explicitly ban adoption, the practical effect is the same. Families are left in limbo. Children remain institutionalized. Loving homes are denied.

I believe violent criminals who are not citizens should be deported.

I do not believe in terrorizing families, targeting neighbors who were recruited here for labor or punishing children for circumstances beyond their control. For generations, our economy has depended on immigrant labor. To invite people in one era and discard them in another is not justice.

I am a follower of Christ, and my faith compels me to speak.

Jesus consistently aligned Himself with the vulnerable, the marginalized and the unpopular. Scripture is clear. We are commanded to love our neighbor as ourselves. We are commanded to welcome the foreigner and treat them as native born. Jesus taught that when we welcome the stranger, we welcome Him.

Christ did not fear foreigners. He protected the vulnerable. And when He saw exploitation masked as righteousness, He responded with righteous anger.

God, Constitution must guide actions

We are all God's children. Every one of us.

Citizen and non-citizen. Immigrant and native born. Adopted and biological. Black, brown and white.

We have a problem.

And the only way forward is together.

My children deserve to grow up in a country that honors the Constitution, protects families and lives up to its moral and spiritual commitments. Not one where fear replaces compassion and silence replaces courage.

We need to come together.

We need to stand up.

I can no longer stand by quietly.

Not as a father.

Not as an American.

Not as a Christian.","https://www.floridatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/PPHX/88355593007-202601251626021000-arizona-faith-network-prayer-vigil-outside-ice.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y0&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 15:06:38.376658

The move to send Homan, a career immigration agent who led ICE during the first Trump administration, suggests a shift in strategy. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has focused on raw numbers of deportations, placing Border Patrol at the helm of operations traditionally led by ICE.

Homan, meanwhile, has backed a more targeted approach to deportations focusing on detaining and removing unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.

It comes as public scrutiny has grown in the wake of the Saturday shooting of 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti by immigration officers in Minneapolis. The Department of Homeland Security and other top officials in the Trump administration rushed to blame Pretti for the shooting, arguing that Pretti was carrying a weapon and that officers were justified in using deadly force against Pretti. But videos circulating on social media do not show Pretti brandishing the weapon, and Pretti was also licensed to carry a weapon consistent with Minnesota law.

Trump distanced himself from the shooting in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Sunday. He said the administration is investigating the incident and declined to immediately say whether the officers followed protocol.

“We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said.

Conservatives have been voicing frustration with DHS and Noem following the shooting. Republicans on the House Homeland Security Committee have asked for leadership of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to appear before them and answer questions from lawmakers.

Some immigration hawks also quickly praised the move to send Homan to Minneapolis.

“There is no one who understands deportations better than Tom Homan. This is a great announcement from the White House,” said Sen. Jim Banks (R-Ind.).

Past tensions with Homan notwithstanding, Noem publicly praised the move Monday, saying Homan “has been a major asset to our team — his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the streets of Minneapolis.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9f%2F7f%2F9204248447ef93997f19aedaacda%2Ftrump-06824.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:59:21.772691

Believe what we tell you, not your own eyes.

Once again, that is what the Trump administration is saying after another protester was shot and killed by federal immigration agents during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis.

It’s the second time in less than three weeks that federal agents killed a protester in Minneapolis. And for the second time, cellphone videos from bystanders on the scene appear to contradict the federal account of the killing.

On Jan. 7, Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet, was shot three times in the face and died as she drove past an ICE agent. The government claimed Good tried to use her car to ram the agent, and that the agent was reacting in self-defense. But videos of that shooting showed Good trying to turn away from the agent and flee the scene.

Then came more horrific events on Saturday.

Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was shot at least 10 times and died while being pinned to the ground by Border Patrol agents. The Department of Homeland Security said Pretti approached agents with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun” and was killed after they attempted to disarm him.

But just like Good’s killing, cellphone videos of the events were analyzed by news organizations, and the analysis did not line up with the government’s assessment.

The New York Times’ Devon Lum and Haley Willis wrote, “Footage shows Mr. Pretti was clearly holding a phone, not a gun, before the agents took him to the ground and shot him.”

The Times later added in that same analysis, “Several agents tussle with Mr. Pretti before bringing him to his knees. He appears to resist as the agents grab his legs, push down on his back and strike him repeatedly. The footage shows an agent approaching with empty hands and grabbing at Mr. Pretti as the others hold him down. About eight seconds after he is pinned, agents yell that he has a gun, indicating that they may not have known he was armed until he was on the ground.

The Times continues, “The same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a gun from among the group that appears to match the profile of a firearm DHS said belonged to Mr. Pretti. The agents appear to have him under their control, with his arms pinned near his head. As the gun emerges from the melee, another agent aims his own firearm at Mr. Pretti’s back and appears to fire one shot at close range. He then appears to continue firing at Mr. Pretti, who collapses. A third agent unholsters a weapon. Both agents appear to fire additional shots into Mr. Pretti as he lies motionless.”

The Associated Press’ Hannah Fingerhut wrote, “In the videos, Pretti is seen with only a phone in his hand. During the scuffle, ‘gun, gun’ is heard, and an officer appears to pull a handgun from Pretti’s waist area and begins moving away. As that happens, a first shot is fired by a Border Patrol officer. There’s a slight pause, and then the same officer fires several more times into Pretti’s back.”

Still, despite all the video evidence, many in the Trump administration placed the blame on Pretti.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and said he “brandished” a gun and intended to “kill law enforcement.” Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said, “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” FBI director Kash Patel said, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want. It’s that simple. You don’t have that right to break the law and incite violence.”

The Wall Street Journal, in its detailed video analysis, wrote, “Federal agents claimed Alex Pretti, 37, forced their hand, alleging he ‘violently resisted’ disarmament until the officers fired ‘defensive shots.’ Bystander footage appears to tell a different story. A frame-by-frame review by The Wall Street Journal shows a federal officer pulling a handgun away from Pretti. Less than a second later, an agent fires several rounds.”

Sunday morning fireworks

The Sunday morning shows featured some testy exchanges as many in the Trump administration seemed to justify the shooting of Pretti.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Kristen Welker pressed Department of Justice official Todd Blanche, who said, “This is not a peaceful protest. … He was not protesting peacefully.”

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino tangled with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Bovino has previously said Pretti was on the scene to “​​inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement.”

Bash told Bovino, “There’s no evidence that he was perpetrating violence! And there’s no evidence, unless you have it, and we’d love to see it if there is, that he was intending to massacre law enforcement, other than the fact that he was there and he had a gun lawfully.”

That led to a heated exchange with Bovino consistently insisting that Pretti was assaulting federal law enforcement.

At another point, while talking about video of the events, Bovino told Bash, “We’re not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze frame.”

Bash responded by saying, “It’s not a freeze frame. We’re showing a video of one of your agents taking the gun away. And that happened before Pretti was shot.

Then there was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent going at it with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on “This Week.” Bressent said at one point that Pretti’s mistake was bringing a gun instead of a billboard to a protest. To which Karl reminded Bessent of the Second Amendment.

Strong words

The editorial boards of The New York Times and The Washington Post both came out strongly against the Trump administration following the latest shooting in Minneapolis.

The Times board wrote, “The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.”

The Times board continued, “The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears.” And then later added, “Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.”

Meanwhile, the Post’s editorial board called Pretti’s killing “unjust” and added, “It’s essential that federal immigration officers don’t think they can act with impunity, because that will only encourage more fatal encounters. An independent probe of this shooting is an important step.”

The Post also wrote, “Most Americans want a secure border, and they think violent criminals should be deported. That’s a large part of why Trump returned to the White House. The overreach of the past year, however, could consume his presidency and lead to more tragedy. If Trump won’t change course on his own, can Republicans in Congress save him from himself?”

The Journal’s take

Meanwhile, the usually conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, “Time for ICE to Pause in Minneapolis.”

It wrote, “Pretti made a tragic mistake by interfering with ICE agents, but that warranted arrest, not a death sentence. The agents may say they felt threatened, but it’s worth noting the comments over the weekend by police around the country who say that this isn’t how they conduct law enforcement. Either many ICE agents aren’t properly trained, or they are so on edge as they face opposition in the streets that they are on a hair trigger. Either way, this calls for rethinking how ICE conducts itself, especially in Minneapolis as tensions build.”

The latest from Trump

Wall Street Journal reporter Josh Dawsey spoke with Trump on the phone for about five minutes on Sunday. Trump told Dawsey that his administration will review “everything” about the shooting.

Trump told Dawsey, “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”

Trump also indicated that ICE agents will leave Minnesota at some point. He told Dawsey, “At some point we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done a phenomenal job.”

Trump didn’t specify when that time might come.

Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” that Trump should consider removing ICE from Minnesota if there’s a “chance of losing more … innocent lives.”

Comer later said, “I’m like you and every other American. I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not. Yeah, I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”

Video tells the story

The one question that keeps cropping up in my mind is: What if no one had been filming what has happened in Minneapolis the past month? Yes, it can be infuriating to listen to those in the administration insist that what we are seeing with our own eyes isn’t what happened. But the videos — and the expert analysis performed by news organizations of those videos — do give us a clear picture of what our government is doing.

CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote, “Minnesota officials, sensing that residents feel relatively powerless amid the ICE surge in the state, have urged residents to bear witness, suggesting that the phones in their pockets are a form of power.”

Just last week, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in an address. “Carry your phone with you at all times. And if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take out that phone and hit record. Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans — not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

Following Saturday’s shooting, Walz said, “Thank God, thank God we have video.”

More notable Minneapolis coverage

The New York Times’ Peter Baker with “For Trump, the Truth in Minneapolis Is What He Says It Is.” Baker notes, “Mr. Trump has found that putting out a story line early and repeating it often can, with the help of an ideological media and online surround-sound machine, convince a sizable share of the public that does not credit contrary evidence. Even after investigations, recounts and his own advisers and attorney general refuted Mr. Trump’s claim that he won the 2020 election, polls show that most Republicans still believe the election was stolen. And so Mr. Trump and his team have taken the same reality-bending approach to the violence in Minneapolis in evident hopes of persuading the president’s political base, at least, that the protesters were responsible for their own deaths …”

The Minnesota Star Tribune has had superb coverage. Here’s Reid Forgrave and Sarah Ritter with “After latest Minneapolis shooting: Exhaustion, resilience and deepening fear.”

Andrew M. Luger, former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota, writes in the Star Tribune: “No one in Minnesota asked for this.”

Post problems

Stunning and grim reporting is out about the state of affairs at The Washington Post.

First, The New York Times reported that the Post will not cover the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy — something that seems unfathomable for one of the most respected and legendary sports sections. Then, Puck’s Dylan Byers reported that massive layoffs are coming to the Post and tweeted, “rumor inside Post is that sports desk could be shuttered entirely… foreign desk will be hit hard too.” Byers added that the expectations are that “hundreds” will be affected.

First, the Olympics news.

In the past, the Post has sent 10 to 20 journalists to the Olympics. And this year, it asked for 14 credentials for the Winter Games, according to the Times. The Times’ Benjamin Mullin and Erik Wemple reported that Post managing editor Kimi Yoshino sent an email to more than a dozen of the Post’s journalists that said, “As we assess our priorities for 2026, we have decided not to send a contingent to the Winter Olympics. We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you, so please reach out to me if you want to talk further.”

What makes this note so shocking is that it comes less than two weeks before the Feb. 6 start of the Olympics. As the Times noted, “Many had already paid for their travel arrangements, according to two people familiar with their plans.”

The Times wrote, “According to the Post employee, the newspaper has already paid the vast majority of its expenses to cover the competition. Those include flights for the journalists, housing and office space at the Olympics site. Housing alone tallies at least $80,000, the employee said. Post management approved the outlays at each step along the way, according to the employee.”

USA Today columnist Christine Brennan, who was once the Olympics writer for the Post, tweeted, “This is just a stunning and awful development.”

Then there’s the Byers tweet talking about shutting down the Post sports section entirely, as well as cutting a major chunk from the foreign coverage. Sports and foreign coverage are two of the Post’s longtime staples. The Post sports section has been home to some of the most legendary sportswriters in the business: Shirley Povich, Tony Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon, Sally Jenkins, Thomas Boswell and the aforementioned Brennan, just to name a few.

The Post isn’t commenting, but it should be noted that Byers wrote that closing the sports desk is just a “rumor.” I still find it hard to believe the Post would take that step, but reports are that the layoffs will be substantial.

Meanwhile, Mullin and Wemple at the Times report that foreign correspondents at the Post have sent a letter — a “collective plea” — to Post owner Jeff Bezos about the rumors. Among the points made in the letter: “Robust, powerful foreign coverage is essential to the Washington Post’s brand and its future success in whatever form the paper takes moving forward.”

The letter also said, “Cutting this deeply sourced, battle-hardened and tireless staff would hinder The Post’s ability to respond to the biggest news developments on the horizon.”

The letter concludes by saying, “Jeff, we are endlessly grateful for your investment in our newspaper and longtime belief in our shared mission. At your first town hall in 2013, you told our newsroom, ‘You can be profitable and shrinking. And that’s a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.’ We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable.”

And Mullin tweeted Sunday afternoon, “I have been told that employees on The Washington Post foreign staff have been told explicitly that their jobs are at risk. There was also a directive barring reporters from going to high-risk zones as of Feb. 1, which some have taken as a precursor to cuts.”

And check out this tweet from longtime New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, “In my decades as a @nytimes foreign correspondent and then columnist, I’ve been regularly scooped and outshone by the brilliance of @washpost rivals. The WashPost foreign correspondents are a public good, and the world benefits from their work. I hope Jeff Bezos keeps them.”

Too far away

We now know which teams (New England and Seattle) will be in this year’s Super Bowl, but we also know who will not be at the big game: President Donald Trump. The president told the New York Post that he will not attend the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, California, because, “It’s just too far away.”

Now, it should be noted that U.S. presidents rarely attend the Super Bowl. In fact, a year ago, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. But to use the excuse that it’s “too far away” seems odd. I mean, isn’t the game being played in a country where Trump is president? The game is being played in California, not on Mars.

Trump also took the opportunity to slam the halftime show selections of Bad Bunny and Green Day, saying, “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”

The judges, representing appointees of nearly every president since Ronald Reagan, have grown increasingly alarmed by what they see as a pattern of defiance by the administration, shocking behavior by ICE and rampant targeting of people with no criminal history, despite Trump’s claim to be targeting “the worst of the worst.”

“Since November 2025, the courts of this District have thought of little else,” Judge Michael Davis said in a Sunday ruling criticizing the Trump administration’s “disingenuous” claim that one of his colleagues had given only a cursory review of its arguments. “It is a grave error to confuse efficiency with lack of rigor.”

The judges’ alarm has formed the backdrop to a broader clash between the Trump administration and Minnesota’s elected leaders, who have decried the operation that has led to the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents. Those deaths, followed by unproven claims and factually disputed accusations about the circumstances by Trump administration officials, have inflamed tensions across the nation and become the flashpoint in a larger battle for the identity of America.

Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Judges who are now weighing those larger cases have already seen their dockets swamped by individual immigration cases arising from Operation Metro Surge.

They include Kate Menendez, who recently ordered ICE to refrain from using retaliatory force against protesters. Her order was later blocked by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Biden-appointed judge is holding an even more significant hearing Monday, in the state’s effort to end Operation Metro Surge altogether.

“I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” Menendez said at the start of Monday’s hearing.

Menendez’s comment came just three days after she ordered the release of a Kenyan woman arrested while picking up seizure medication at a CVS, saying the administration lacked a legal basis to lock her up.

Another judge, Trump appointee Eric Tostrud, issued a restraining order on Saturday requiring the Trump administration to preserve evidence gathered from the scene of Alex Pretti’s shooting death. He is also weighing a class action lawsuit against racial profiling during the surge. Tostrud’s docket has been deluged with individual immigration cases for weeks, and he has ruled in every one of them that the administration had been illegally detaining people targeted for deportation without the opportunity for bond hearings.

The massive workload facing Minnesota judges may actually understate the impact of Operation Metro Surge: Department of Homeland Security officials have been quickly transferring some detainees out of state — often to deportation staging areas in Texas — which prevents them from filing for relief in Minnesota courts.

That was the case in another petition handled by Davis, who expressed shock at the administration’s treatment of a Burmese woman with three children, including a five-month-old baby, and a heart condition. The woman, who was admitted as a refugee in 2024, was abruptly moved to Texas after her Jan. 10 arrest. Davis ordered her return on Friday.

“There is simply no legal reason for keeping this mother 1800 miles away from her children,” the Clinton appointee said. “While the Court recognizes that many families are suffering due to … ICE actions in the District of Minnesota, there is something particularly craven about transferring a nursing refugee mother out-of-state.”

In a Saturday ruling, U.S. District Judge John Gerrard — a Nebraska-based judge helping Minnesota work through its crowded docket — ordered the release of a pregnant woman apprehended on her way to work, as well as her husband and two minor sons. The Trump administration signaled it was “attempting to locate” the family, and Gerrard gave them until Monday night to comply.

A second visiting judge, Missouri-based Stephen Bough, threatened contempt sanctions against the administration for sending a woman out of state despite his order to keep her in Minnesota.

The most common challenge raised by ICE’s targets is that they have been detained without due process — often arrested without a warrant and without the opportunity for bond hearings to remain released while deportation proceedings are pending. Judges across the country have overwhelmingly rejected the Trump administration’s bid to lock up nearly everyone it is targeting for deportation — a sharp break from every administration of the last 30 years, which prioritized detention only for those deemed dangerous or likely to flee.

A POLITICO analysis has identified 347 judges across the country who have rejected the administration’s detention policy — in more than 2,400 cases — while just 20 judges have sided with the administration, a small minority that has nevertheless grown in recent weeks. The emergency nature of the cases has so far stymied efforts to get appeals courts or the Supreme Court to weigh in on the policy, which has resulted in district courts’ dockets being clogged across the country. Hundreds of new emergency petitions for release are filed every day.

The judges in Minnesota are now bearing the brunt of the deluge. All but one — the Reagan-appointed Judge Paul Magnuson — have rejected the administration’s mass detention policy. And their frustrations are beginning to spill into the open more frequently.

Davis, in a third recently decided case, vented that the administration appeared not to be affording bond hearings to its targets — even after federal judges had ordered them.

“There has been an undeniable move by the Government in the past month to defy court orders or at least to stretch the legal process to the breaking point in an attempt to deny noncitizens their due process rights,” Davis wrote in a Sunday ruling. “With the evidence currently before the Court, it can only conclude that Respondents are attempting to ‘undermin[e] the regulatory and statutory authority of the immigration courts to coerce perpetual, infinite detention.’”

But it was the direct confrontation between the Trump administration and Minnesota’s chief federal judge, Patrick Schiltz, that laid bare the most obvious tensions. The George W. Bush appointee, in two Friday letters to the 8th Circuit, accused the administration of a “frivolous” bid to force the arrest of former CNN anchor Don Lemon and others linked to an anti-ICE demonstration at a St. Paul church.

“I am also dealing with a number of emergencies, including a lockdown at the Minneapolis courthouse because of protest activity, the defiance of several court orders by ICE, and the illegal detention of many detainees by ICE,” Schiltz wrote.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa7%2F6f%2Fcbb6ec2a4ebaa6e018c7e0c828a0%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2255793430,N,,2026-01-26 11:59:26.054865

Demonstrators brought signs and chanted against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration a day after 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday morning.

“It's good to see,” said Kathleen Devarenne, a protester. “I wish it were a lot more,” she said, referring to the turnout.

“I'm still worried,” she said.

The protest was organized by Kent County Indivisible. It’s the city’s latest anti-ICE demonstration, less than three weeks after the killing of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE agent, which spurred rallies across West Michigan.

Another protester, Jaylyn Gough, said she felt a need to make her voice heard.

“My thoughts and my prayers are with [Gough’s] family, and it's absolute murder,” said Gough. “As a Native woman, I often feel alone in this walk, and today, looking at all of this, I finally feel that I'm not alone.

“I think we're out here just to share and to show that people do not agree with what is happening right now,” she said. “We hope that this message gets to Minnesota, not only Minnesota, but everywhere across the country who is dealing with ICE.”

Devarenne hopes that the nationwide protests send a message to President Donald Trump.

“He needs to see that a good amount of the population does not support these terrible actions that don't follow due process and harm and kill innocent people,” she said. “I believe that our government has turned away from the Constitution.”

Some held signs expressing solidarity with Minnesota. Others reminded people of ICE’s presence in West Michigan.

Thousands of masked federal officers with uncertain authority are rampaging through the region, assaulting protesters and innocent people, abusing constitutional safeguards, staking out daycares and schools, snatching people off the streets in unmarked vans based on the color of their skin or their accent, and recklessly, relentlessly provoking violent confrontations with civilians—all against the loud, repeatedly expressed wishes of local and state officials.

Saturday morning, federal agents—apparently from the Border Patrol—shot and killed a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, amid a chaotic scuffle in front of a well-known Minneapolis donut store after agents began hassling and shoving him in the street. It was the second time this month that federal agents resorted to deadly force within mere seconds after initiating an encounter with a Minneapolis civilian who never posed a threat to agents.

All of this unnecessary violence raises the question: Why can’t elected officials do more to stop this? Apart from the courts, doesn’t Minnesota’s government have cards it can play in the battle against the Trump-led occupation, like calling out the National Guard for a showdown with federal agents?

The answer, in its shortest form, is mostly no, due to the basic foundations of American federalism. Over and over, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota governor Tim Walz have asked President Donald Trump to call back his operation. On Saturday, they again told the public that they had pleaded with the federal government to reconsider and withdraw the upwards of 3,000 immigration officers, who together nearly outnumber the region’s 10 largest state and local police departments combined.

But Walz and Frey haven’t taken overt actions to use state and local governments to actively resist because a key part of federalism in the United States is that a state can’t really resist federal authority or kick out federal law enforcement officials. That principle primarily exists because the federal government is meant to be the “protector” of last resort if local and state officials fail to uphold the rights of ordinary citizens. What’s remarkable, and worrisome, is that Trump today is using that arrangement to punish political opponents based on his own whims, as un-American an action as any president has ever undertaken and one that threatens the very union of the United States.

Tension in Minnesota between national officials and state and local elected officials is already sky high—and there’s rising animus between the federal forces and local law enforcement as well.

Minneapolis police were quick to condemn the shootings of both Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on January 7. They have also been vocal in recent days about how their own officers have been harassed and even assaulted by immigration agents while off-duty. (“Every one of [the off-duty officers stopped by immigration agents] is a person of color,” one police chief complained.) DHS agents tried to bar local police from the shooting scene on Saturday, forcing them to return with a court order, and this time FBI agents again apparently resisted allowing access. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” the head of the state’s investigation bureau said.

A governor also has the state's National Guard at their disposal, which could hypothetically be deployed to counter ICE's actions. Yesterday, Minnesota governor Tim Walz announced that he activated them following the shooting, amid a tense series of hours that saw the NBA postpone its evening game in Minneapolis for safety reasons. In a statement whose banality and simplicity underplayed just how stunning it was, the governor’s office said the guard was needed because “local law enforcement resources are stretched thin because of the disruption to public safety caused by thousands of federal immigration agents in our neighborhoods.” So far it seems like Walz’s intent is to use the National Guard and local and state police as more of a buffer between federal forces and Minnesota residents, rather than as a supplement to the street resistance efforts.

For now, state and local officials—like those who also suffered from heavy-handed immigration deployments last year, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and elsewhere—are primarily focused on using federal courts for relief. Overnight, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to ensure that federal officials didn’t destroy or alter evidence related to Saturday’s shooting. More broadly, Minnesota has a pending lawsuit aimed at blocking the immigration deployments altogether.

This restraint is almost certainly intended to prevent even further escalation, driven by President Trump’s apparent eagerness to declare Minnesota in a state of “insurrection” that would allow him to activate and deploy federal troops against its residents. Trump has already launched unprecedented criminal investigations against Walz and Frey, and others, in an apparent bid to create pretexts that could aid the use of the Insurrection Act.

The situation is so unprecedented—and the Trump administration’s political incentives so skewed by social media and the president’s own manias—that it’s impossible to understand or predict how the coming days and weeks might unfold. It’s especially unclear how state or local elected leaders might make the situation better for their constituents and neighbors—and, because of the Trump administration’s lawlessness, there are many paths where the situation worsens.

President Trump and his Department of Homeland Security in many ways appear to be attempting to provoke an actual showdown between federal forces and local or state authorities. DHS and White House officials have repeatedly labeled protesters exercising their First Amendment rights in Minnesota “domestic terrorists,” and they were quick to smear the victim of Saturday’s shooting; they shut down an investigation of the ICE officer who killed Renee Nicole Good earlier this month and ordered a federal investigation of Good and her spouse instead, leading to the resignation of the FBI agent assigned to the case; at least six federal prosecutors also resigned, refusing to participate in the attempt to scapegoat a victim.

In a deeply troubling development, ICE agents have started declaring that people who so much as record them are being entered into a national database as “domestic terrorists.” “Have fun with that,” an ICE officer in Maine was captured joking to a civilian filming him. (That the assault on Minneapolis has little to do with violent crime or immigration issues was underscored Saturday when attorney general Pam Bondi sent state officials a letter saying they’d withdraw the federal forces if Minnesota complied with a Trump request to turn over its voter rolls.)

While Walz and Frey’s seeming passivity in the face of an all-out federal attack on their constituents is provoking anger among activists, it may be a case where caution and restraint is the better part of valor. Citizens are already generating massive resistance to the federal presence in Minnesota, and any additional “official” resistance by local or state officials may tip the scales for Trump and bring federal troops into the picture, an escalation that would be surely worse for residents, the state, and the nation at large. Trump has already put some 1,500 federal troops in Alaska on standby to deploy to Minnesota, and all indications are that he’s eager for an excuse to do so.

Any such declaration of “insurrection” or deployment of federal troops to further subdue local and state authorities would bring the country the closest it’s been to civil war since, well, the Civil War.

A Brief History of Sending In the Troops

Under normal circumstances, the use of federal military forces in domestic situations is highly proscribed and limited by two sets of law, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878—which prohibits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement—and the Insurrection Act, a series of statutes that date to 1792 and outline when a president can call out troops to suppress rebellions and domestic violence.

Considering how critical a principle it guards, the Insurrection Act is badly antiquated, as recent reform efforts have shown. As national security legal scholar Scott Anderson wrote in 2024, “Few principles of American government are more foundational than the idea that the US military should not be used against Americans, except in the most dire of circumstances. But even fewer foundational principles are so loosely grounded in the law … The fact that past presidents have done so relatively rarely is more a product of long-standing political norms than hard legal limits.”

While state National Guard units and federal troops are routinely used to help respond to natural disasters at the request of and in coordination with local and state officials, since Reconstruction presidents have only reluctantly ever sent in federal agents or troops against the wishes of state governments. Even then, it’s in highly limited circumstances, such as defending civil rights and freedoms in moments when state officials refused to do so. (National Guard units usually report to state governors, although they can be federalized by presidential order to report to the commander-in-chief instead—meaning that Trump could always circumvent Walz activating them by putting them under direct Pentagon control anyway.)

In fact, while National Guard troops were used repeatedly in the 20th century by governors and presidents to break labor strikes—often brutally—it wasn’t until the Civil Rights movement and the 1960s that federal troops began to play a more routine role in responding to civil disturbances.

In 1957, when Arkansas governor Orval Faubus used the state’s National Guard to block the integration of Little Rock Central High School, President Dwight Eisenhower responded by federalizing all 10,000 Arkansas National Guardsmen and deploying troops from the 101st Airborne Division to force the school’s integration and protect the nine Black students attempting to enroll there. The mission was a key learning opportunity for the military, and when the Army manual on “Civil Disturbances” was republished in 1958, it had doubled in size and now contained a new section on riot control.

In every year of his short presidency, President John F. Kennedy deployed federal marshals or troops against the wishes of state officials as the civil rights movement gained momentum. In 1961, some 400 federal marshals were sent to Alabama to protect the Freedom Riders, and when James Meredith attempted to enroll as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962, Kennedy sent federal marshals who then faced incredibly violent white protesters.

With the marshals under attack, Kennedy deployed first the Mississippi National Guard and then thousands of federal troops as well. (That military operation, codenamed RAPID ROAD, was actually the first and only time during the Cold War that the military activated and used plans it had developed to quell civil disturbances in the wake of a nuclear attack.)

Then, in 1963, Kennedy again relied on the National Guard to help with the integration of the University of Alabama, and his successor, Lyndon Johnson, used marshals and the National Guard to protect civil rights marchers in Selma after Alabama state troopers infamously attacked them at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in an incident that came to be known as “Bloody Sunday.”

Presidents began using military troops, including the National Guard, more routinely in America’s cities in the 1960s. During summer riots following police brutality in Detroit in 1967, President Johnson ordered elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions into the city, and Michigan governor George Romney called up the Michigan National Guard; more than 40 people were killed, more than half by Detroit police. National Guard troops killed 11, including a 4-year-old girl, Tanya Blanding, who died when a Michigan guardsman opened fire with a tank-mounted .50-caliber machine gun on her apartment after wrongly believing a sniper was inside.

While troops were used again amid the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., the downside and risk of such deployments was vividly captured two years later at Kent State University when National Guard troops opened fire on students protesting the Vietnam War, killing four and wounding nine.

Over the years since, there has been incredibly limited domestic use of federal troops—the Los Angeles riots of 1992 being one exception—and presidents and attorneys general until the Trump administration usually go out of their way to coordinate surges of federal law enforcement to cities or states.

Even during the peak of the marshals and troop deployments to the South amid the Civil Rights movement, presidents only acted after state officials either refused to quell violence targeting Americans practicing their constitutional rights or, in the case of the Alabama state troopers, were the cause of the violence against peaceful citizens themselves. Often, a president acted only after there was defiance on the ground of a lawful court order—ensuring that there was a second branch of government acting as a check-and-balance and trigger for such federal action.

While Trump has said that the immigration enforcement effort in Minneapolis—as with previous efforts in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Charlotte, Portland and, most recently, Maine—is meant to enforce “law and order,” there’s no apparent rhyme, reason, or necessity to the deployments beyond political terror.

Trump today is attempting something unprecedented that stands in contravention of all historical tradition in the United States: the brutal application of federal forces against a state and region with no apparent reason beyond its being led by members of the political opposition.

In deploying immigration officers and border security agents from the DHS, rather than deputy US marshals from the Department of Justice—as presidents in the past have done—Trump is also changing the nature and tenor of his federal force. Marshals, whose work and training involves constitutional rights and protections, have always been used to protect civil rights and valid court orders and come with strong federal policing powers and authorities. The agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE are different. They are not trained to normal federal law enforcement standards of dealing with the public and are meant to operate with severely limited authority to enforce immigration matters, not general federal laws. CBP agents in particular are less a regular law enforcement agency, grounded in due process, and more a paramilitary force meant to operate on the border regions. They were never intended to have regular contact with US citizens and civilians.

Trump has also attempted to use troops in similar crackdowns over the last year and been stymied by federal courts, who, among other instances, preliminarily blocked his federalization of the California National Guard.","https://media.wired.com/photos/69763dfa2963322ff178d7bc/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/WIRED_ICE_GettyImages-2257462492.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 12:59:20.755676

PROTESTERS: ICE out! ICE out! ICE out! ICE out!

JOHN HAMILTON: It was 10 degrees below zero Fahrenheit when a crowd numbering in the tens of thousands marched through downtown Minneapolis Friday afternoon calling on ICE to get out of Minnesota. It was the largest single day of action so far in the ongoing standoff between local community and the Trump administration since ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agents, now numbering around 3,000, descended on Minnesota for Operation Metro Surge several weeks ago, bringing chaos, fear and violence.

JENNA SHERRICK: My name is Jenna Sherrick. I’m a local Minnesotan who grew up here my whole life. What’s going around is not OK, and we all need to be here to make a difference and say it’s not OK. When cruelty becomes reality, compassion becomes radical.

SARAH SHEA: Sarah Shea. I’m a Minnesotan. And I’m here to support our immigrant neighbors and our friends and families and people who are not deserving what’s going on right now. It’s outrageous. We’re frustrated. We’re angry. We’re everything. And we should all be out here supporting our neighbors and getting ICE out of our city. ICE out. And we protect us, because right now that is all us. It’s all community. We are the only ones out here doing it for each other.

PROTESTER: Standing back and not doing anything doesn’t help with, you know, the situation. Everybody’s scared. Everybody. So we need to speak out.

JOHN HAMILTON: The day of action was organized by clergy and labor leaders under the banner ”ICE Out: A Day of Truth and Freedom.” The Minnesota AFL-CIO, representing over a thousand unions across the state, endorsed the march, as well as many others. John Reuss is an English teacher with the Minnesota Federation of Educators.

JOHN REUSS: And we are here to shut it all down. All of us teachers, from Minneapolis to St. Paul, from all the way up from Duluth down to Rochester, we are all here in the middle of Minneapolis to shut it all down for our students and their families, and ICE out of our communities. Every teacher has so many stories right now.

But, you know, one, last week, I had a student who joined online during class, and in the middle of my lesson — I teach English — the student messaged me and said, ”ICE is outside of my house right now. What do I do?” And, you know, I stopped class right away. All the students heard what happened. And, you know, thank God his neighbors were out there outside of his house, and they chased ICE out of their neighborhood. Those agents had been circling his house all morning. And, you know, I think it’s really telling of our community, of our neighborhoods, how we’ve organized and how we are out there defending one another, including my student, who, thank God, he’s safe.

You know, the fear is so tangible. The fear is so tangible. This is our last option. We need to shut it all down. And so I am calling on every educator in this state, in this country, to shut it down, with Minneapolis, with St. Paul. You need to shut it all down with us, because if we do not shut it down right now, your city is next. And I do not — we do not want that to happen. We want to protect our students. We want our students back in schools. And the way we are going to get it is by shutting it down, to get ICE the hell out of here.

JOHN HAMILTON: Among those protesting were members of the Hmong American community, like Julie, whose family came to the United States decades ago as refugees after working alongside the U.S. in its secret war in Laos during the Vietnam War. She held a sign that read “Hmong Against ICE.”

JULIE: It’s scary, because they don’t — regardless of if you’re a citizen or not, they don’t ask. No question asked. They just assume that you’re illegal, that you’re a criminal. And it’s not fair for those of us people of color. My parents, they’re citizens. But we all live in fear. I’m a citizen, and I still live in fear every single day. And then, now my kids are in fear of, you know, going to school, because they have heard of stories of kids getting detained. And then, my kids, they’re scared of going to school. And we was promised safety. We was promised that, you know, we’ll get the freedom. But yet, today’s world, we are seeing that, you know, it’s getting revoked. Like, the United States are taking back the words. And the question is: Why? Why is it getting revoked? Why are we now being targeted as, you know, aliens, criminals? Some of us took off work, no school, no shopping, so we’re all out here against ICE.

JOHN HAMILTON: As demonstrators in the streets shut down parts of the Twin Cities, more than 700 businesses across the state closed their doors for what some called an economic blackout or general strike. Insight Brewing in Minneapolis was closed for business but stayed open for neighbors participating in the day of action. This is marketing manager Joey Steinbach.

JOEY STEINBACH: We are a space for our community, and our community is hurting right now. And the best way that we can help out is just direct-to-family donations. We’ve got a bunch of volunteers that are absolutely stellar. Outside of that, we’re just making some signs. We’re providing snacks, hand warmers, you know, just being a temporary third space while we’re not open for official business.

JOHN HAMILTON: Corporations that support or work with ICE were also targeted by demonstrators, like at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport —

PROTESTERS: Whose airport? Our airport! Whose airport? Our airport!

JOHN HAMILTON: — where demonstrators gathered to protest deportation flights.

PROTESTERS: Delta, Delta, you can’t hide! We can see your ICE-y side!

JOHN HAMILTON: The crowd of several hundred held signs that said “Business as usual doesn’t fly” and “Renee Good was good.” Among those who gathered were dozens of faith leaders. They shared stories of airport workers who had been arrested.

CLERGY MEMBER: We lift up Pedro, a janitor who helped his sister, who is unable to work, and was detained. He decided to self-deport because he could not take the conditions at the detention center in Texas.

JOHN HAMILTON: The union that represents airport workers reports at least 12 members have been arrested by ICE. Clergy then joined arms and sang, while others knelt and prayed, before police surrounded them, and at least a hundred were arrested.

PROTESTERS: For every one that you arrest, a thousand more will show up next!

JOHN HAMILTON: According to organizers, more than 70,000 people marched in Minneapolis Friday, and several thousand were in attendance at the Target Center for a rally. This is comedian and native Minnesotan, Lizz Winstead.

LIZZ WINSTEAD: And the untold thousands that are in this sport bowl facility, I am proud to call you neighbors. I do have to point out that we are in the Target Center, which may seem ironic, but remember, the Target Center is something our tax dollars pay for. So, chant it with me: Whose stadium?

CROWD: Our stadium!

LIZZ WINSTEAD: Whose stadium?

CROWD: Our stadium!

PROTESTERS: We are many! We are many! We are one! We are one!

JOHN HAMILTON: The venue is named after the retail giant based in Minnesota that activists have criticized for permitting ICE to operate on their property and to arrest employees without warrants.

LIZZ WINSTEAD: And when today is over, let’s commit to shopping at the businesses that stood with us, and make sure they can make it through these tough times, because the silence from the corporations in this state is deafening.

JOHN HAMILTON: Speaking at the rally, faith and labor leaders urged Minnesotans to continue to stand together. This is CWA President Claude Cummings.

CLAUDE CUMMINGS JR.: We stand in defiance of a wannabe dictator, and we will rise against the corporations and Trump’s billionaire buddies quietly funding his campaign to shred the Constitution. Political scientists and historians tell us, when countries have successfully prevented or reversed authoritarian control, unions have played an important role in stopping it. How do we do that? We stand shoulder to shoulder with our union siblings and with allies across the country. We do that when we join together and focus our attention directly on the corporations that enable fascism. Our unity across communities, organizations and unions is our power. And whatever we do, we must do it together.

JOHN HAMILTON: And they spoke of neighbors who had been lost to ICE violence. This is Rabbi Arielle Lekach-Rosenberg.

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: I want to lift up the names of two neighbors: Victor Manuel Díaz, abducted from his workplace in Minnesota on January 6th, who died in ICE custody in Texas on January 14th.

CROWD: Shame!

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: I want to lift up the name of Renee Macklin Good, queer poet, wife, parent, murdered in south Minneapolis by ICE on January 7th while observing an abduction in her neighborhood.

Videos of confrontations between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Minneapolis residents have flooded social media, showing some of the 3,000 officers who are deployed in the city stopping, questioning and detaining residents.

In one case, immigration agents escorted a U.S. citizen who is a grandfather of Hmong ancestry out of his house in his underwear in freezing weather. In another case, a father of a 5-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a U.S. citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a 5-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.

The events have sparked protests and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain you? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public versus a private space, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?

Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.

What rights do people have when approached by ICE?

Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone — including immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specializing in immigration cases.

The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.

For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions — such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest — require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the U.S. illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.

Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption,” said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed or would be committed.

Agents must meet an even higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause,” which generally requires enough evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.

What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?

Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.

In the 2025 case Noem v. Perdomo, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favor of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.

Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area,” Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile.”

Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling,” said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.

But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not co-signed by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility,” said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump v. Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?

The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.

“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as if an officer encounters a violent crime in progress, or someone needing medical care.

Securing a judicial warrant is time consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.

In the past, federal immigration officers typically would not forcibly enter homes if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE itself, without a judge’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.

Specific ICE officials have authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.

A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press reported Jan. 22.

The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo.”

The May 12, 2025, memo, signed by ICE acting director Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

If this policy were to be challenged in court, it’s unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.

What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?

If you believe that your rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, your options for suing for compensation are limited.

Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil lawsuits against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions, before tightening them again.

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICE_rights.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:00:00.887493

The big picture: Federal immigration agents have shot and killed two Minnesota citizens in recent weeks, inflaming local protests and a nationwide backlash against Trump's immigration enforcement tactics that have turned Minneapolis into a powder keg.

Driving the news: One federal judge will weigh whether the Trump administration's immigration surge is constitutional, and could ultimately halt it as state and local officials are requesting.

Another judge will hold a hearing in a case over state access to evidence surrounding the death of Pretti, the 37-year-old nurse whom a federal immigration agent shot and killed Saturday.

Catch up quick: Pretti's killing came after a federal agent fatally shot Renee Good weeks earlier.

The Trump administration demonized the victims in the aftermath, labeling them ""domestic terrorists."" They also allegedly restricted local and state agencies from investigating each incident, leading Minnesota officials to sue for access.

Here's what to know about the cases with hearings on Monday:

Twin Cities and state sue Trump administration

The state of Minnesota and lawyers for St. Paul and Minneapolis asked a judge to deem the federal immigration surge unconstitutional, according to a complaint filed earlier this month.

The lawsuit argues that the federal crackdown is infringing on state authority and amounts to coercion, which the state and cities argue is a violation of the Tenth Amendment.

""Defendants' actions force such an impermissible 'choice': use state and local law enforcement resources to carry out the federal government's civil immigration priorities or accept occupation by federal troops,"" the complaint reads.

As noted by The New York Times, the suit does not seek to end all immigration enforcement in the state but rather targets the ""unprecedented surge.""

The other side: The federal government slammed the state argument as ""absurdity"" and ""legally frivolous.""

They say the government's ""Operation Metro Surge"" has ""succeeded"" in seeing thousands arrested and is an exclusively federal mission to enforce federal law.

Expelling federal officers from the state, the administration argued, would be ""an unprecedented act of judicial overreach.""

What we're watching: U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, a Biden appointee, will hear arguments in the case Monday morning.

She is also overseeing a separate case filed by Minnesota demonstrators who accused agents of violating their rights. She imposed restrictions, but an appeals court blocked her injunction.

Worth noting: Those cases both predate the fatal shooting of Renee Good, but the legal fights have drawn more attention since then.

Feds barred from ""destroying"" evidence

Over the weekend, U.S. District Court Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the fatal shooting of Pretti.

At a Monday afternoon hearing, the government will have a chance to raise objections to that order.

What they're saying: Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Axios Sunday that any claim the government would destroy evidence is ""a ridiculous attempt to divide the American people and distract from the fact that our law enforcement officers were attacked.""

Yes, but: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already pledged a state investigation, blasting the federal government's accounts of Alex Pretti's final moments as false.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office asked in a complaint filed Saturday for the court to declare the feds' restriction of state access to evidence unconstitutional.

READ MORE: Videos of deadly Minneapolis shooting of Alex Pretti contradict Trump administration statements

The White House reached out to Senate Democrats late Sunday, as have Republicans, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.

But they have not yet raised any realistic solutions, the aide said.

Republicans will need some Democratic support to pass the remaining spending bills in time to avoid a partial shutdown. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand.

On Sunday, House and Senate Democrats convened separate conference calls as they privately assess next steps and press to restrain the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

A deal begins to unravel

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee and key negotiator on the funding package, had been pushing her colleagues to vote for the homeland security bill, arguing that Democrats had successfully fought off major increases to the ICE budget.

But in the wake of the shooting, Murray said Sunday on X that ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray wrote.

Federal officials have defended the actions of the agents involved in the Good and Pretti shootings as justified. Democrats said video released of both shootings showed otherwise. Republicans are increasingly challenged, with some calling for thorough investigations while others stand with federal officials.

""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., posted on X. ""The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.""

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., wants a ""thorough and impartial investigation"" into the shooting and said ""any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said Democrats should reconsider their threat to not support DHS funding and work with him to ""end the mess created by sanctuary city policies.""

""Now is not the time to defund one of our major national security priorities: border protection,"" Graham said on X.

Funding puzzle will be hard to solve

The growing backlash from Democrats puts Republican leaders in the Senate in a difficult position.

Much of the government, including the Department of Defense, continues to operate on a short-term bill that provides funding only through Friday.

Republican leaders had hoped to avoid another shutdown after last fall's 43-day closure that revolved around Democrats' insistence on extending federal subsidies that make health coverage more affordable for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Before Pretti's death, many Democrats felt the same way about a potential shutdown, lending support in the House to most of the remaining appropriations bills — with DHS the exception.

House Democrats largely rejected the homeland security portion last week with just a handful joining Republicans to ensure its passage. More than 100 House Democrats called for Noem's impeachment.

The House sent the six funding bills to the Senate as a package, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to strip out the homeland security portion which Democrats are demanding.

Despite the procedural hurdles, Schumer said Sunday that Republicans should work with Democrats to advance the other five bills and rewrite the DHS bill. ""This is the best course of action, and the American people are on our side,"" Schumer said.

The path ahead is uncertain. The Senate is not scheduled to return to session until Tuesday, due to the snowstorm. The House plans to be out of session this week and would have to pass the funding package again if it is changed.

Democrats are pushing for policy changes to be added to the homeland security spending bill that would force ICE agents to use warrants for immigration arrests, mandate strengthened training, require agents to identify themselves and have Border Patrol agents stay on the border rather than assisting ICE with immigration raids in the interior of the country.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees homeland security funding, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that Congress cannot fund a department ""that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls across the country in violation of the law.""

One by one, Democrats stake out opposition

Democratic senators discussed the options on Sunday evening's call but without changes from Republicans, they appeared headed toward a shutdown. On the morning call with House Democrats, they heard from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison, both former congressmen.

Several other Democratic senators announced they would vote ""no"" on homeland security money, including some who had helped Republicans end the record shutdown last year.

WATCH: House approves final spending bills for the year

""The abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,"" Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said in a post on X. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., also said she opposes that portion of the package.

Minnesota's Democratic senators also indicated they will oppose the DHS funding bill.

""For those asking where we go from here: Not voting to fund ICE is a great place for us to start,"" Sen. Tina Smith wrote on X.

""We oppose the ICE funding bill. We call for a full and transparent investigation with state officials,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. ""And we call on our Republican colleagues to stand up. They know this is wrong.""

Why the entire government wouldn't shut down

The progress that Congress has made so far on spending bills means that much of the federal government's work would continue even if lawmakers are unable to complete the job.

A bill that Trump signed Friday funds the departments of Justice, Commerce and the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers through the end of the budget year in September.

The Department of Agriculture was funded from a previous measure, which means a shutdown shouldn't stop food assistance this time.

But other critical operations of the government would be disrupted.

County Board Chair Matt de Ferranti and Board member Takis Karantonis encouraged calling the emergency number. De Ferranti noted at a meeting on Saturday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents “have no legal requirement to tell us when they come into our community.”

“It helps us know when ICE is in Arlington, so we can better pursue Arlington County’s law enforcement mission — preventing violence in our community,” he said.

De Ferranti argued that a lack of coordination with local law enforcement is part of a broader effort to sideline localities. He said he planned to bring forward, in coming weeks, “targeted and thoughtful” county resources for family members of those taken into custody or deported by the Trump administration.

“ICE’s approach is designed to provoke right now, and to seek out conflict,” he said.

At least 19 people have been removed from Arlington as part of ICE enforcement efforts, de Ferranti said. He opened the County Board meeting with discussion on this topic around 9:30 a.m., shortly before a federal immigration officer shot and killed a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis on Saturday morning.

There to speak on another matter during the public-comment period, retired Arlington County Police Department officer Gregg Kurasz said it would be better for residents to call the police non-emergency number — 703-558-2222 — rather than the emergency line.

“That would be more efficient” without losing time in getting a response, he said.

Karantonis disagreed.

“I would always call 911 when I see an ICE officer in my neighborhood — 911 is the best solution,” he said.

County Board member Susan Cunningham, meanwhile, suggested callers should use their best judgment when deciding which line to call.

“It goes to the same people. You just get queued a little differently,” she said.

Karantonis said the Trump administration seems intent on “converting law enforcement into a military intervention with all the trappings and appearance and posture of some sort of regime change.”

“This makes me very fearful,” Karantonis said, calling for “new innovative ways” to address the matter.

“I am not only fearful — I am afraid,” he said. “In a democracy, nobody should be afraid.”

Cunningham said it was important for the community to learn what role the county government can, and cannot, play in matters related to ICE efforts in Arlington.

Immigration law creates a clear hierarchy of access to the United States. Most people who are not U.S. citizens do not have any right to set foot in the country. By contrast, U.S. citizens can come and go as they please. One rung below U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents – also known as green card holders – can come and go unless they’ve committed certain crimes.

This month, the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on the evidence that immigration officials need to treat permanent residents as if they are removable. In Bondi v. Lau, the justices are likely to consider whether border officials can rely on criminal charges alone to decide that permanent residents have committed an offense that can allow the government to remove them from the country.

Muk Choi Lau, a Chinese citizen, became a permanent resident of the United States in 2007. Almost five years later, New Jersey prosecutors charged him with trademark counterfeiting. While the criminal case against him was pending, Lau left the United States.

On his return, immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York decided that Lau should not be admitted into the United States – that is, authorized to enter and remain in the country indefinitely. Instead, the officer allowed Lau to proceed into the country under “parole,” a legal permission to enter the country for humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.

More than one year later, in 2013, Lau pleaded guilty to the criminal charges. The following year, immigration officials began legal proceedings to strip Lau of his green card and forcibly remove him from the United States.

Lau’s legal right to continue living in the United States hinges on the decision by the immigration officer at JFK Airport to deny Lau admission and instead parole him into the United States. Migrants who have been admitted into the United States can be deported if they are convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of their admission as a permanent resident. (Courts have described crimes of moral turpitude as “a nebulous concept,” but they have remained part of immigration law since 1891.)

The government claims that Lau’s conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude, but the passage of time – five years and 10 months – between his crime and his admission as a permanent resident means he would likely avoid deportation had he been admitted at JFK. By contrast, migrants who were paroled, rather than admitted, into the United States can be forcibly removed if they commit a crime involving moral turpitude at any time. Simply put, Lau’s conviction would not have affected his immigration status had he been admitted at JFK, but it spelled the beginning of his removal from the United States because he was paroled.

Challenging the government’s efforts to remove him, Lau argued that the immigration officer wrongly denied him admission. An immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals, the administrative unit within the Justice Department that hears appeals of decisions by immigration judges, disagreed with Lau. According to the BIA, federal immigration law permits an officer to deny admission and instead parole a permanent resident into the United States when a criminal prosecution is pending that, if it leads to a conviction, would permit immigration officials to bar a migrant’s entry.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit disagreed with the BIA. In a unanimous opinion for a three-judge panel, Judge Richard J. Sullivan concluded that Lau should have been admitted to the United States, rather than paroled. According to the court, the Immigration and Nationality Act clearly explains that permanent residents who are returning from abroad generally “shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States.” The presumption gives way only in the limited circumstances that Congress identified in the statute, including when a migrant “has committed” a crime involving moral turpitude.

The tricky part is agreeing on when immigration officials have enough evidence to know that someone has “committed” a crime that could lead to their exclusion from the United States. Assuming that trademark counterfeiting is a crime involving moral turpitude – a legal question that the 2nd Circuit did not decide – there is no question today, 12 years after Lau was convicted, that he would lose the presumption of reentry that Congress wrote into immigration law.

But when the immigration agent stationed at JFK denied Lau admission, Lau had not been convicted. Back then, federal officials could not be sure that he had committed the counterfeiting crime. At most, the immigration officer knew that prosecutors had accused Lau of committing the offense. Congress could have enacted a law allowing agents to exclude people based on nothing more than accusations of criminal activity, but that is not what Congress did. Instead, the law that Congress did enact requires more than the possibility that a migrant has committed a crime.

Building on an earlier BIA decision, the 2nd Circuit explained that immigration law requires “clear and convincing evidence” that the migrant committed the crime. Accusations alone fall short. As Judge Sullivan explained, “it will generally be difficult for DHS to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien has committed a qualifying crime at the time of admission if the admission precedes the LPR’s criminal trial or admission of guilt.”

Unlike the 2nd Circuit, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 5th and 9th Circuits have previously adopted positions that align with the government’s view. One traditional basis for the Supreme Court to add a case to its docket is to resolve a dispute among lower courts. Though the justices have not publicly explained their reason for intervening, it is likely that the division among the courts of appeals created by the 2nd Circuit’s opinion affected their decision.

When it comes, the court’s opinion will determine how much flexibility immigration officers have to impose consequences on migrants for committing crimes even before it is clear that they in fact committed a crime. The difference between a criminal prosecution and a conviction is important because many people are prosecuted but ultimately not convicted. Allowing immigration officials to act on nothing more than criminal charges that are pending means that migrants can more easily be barred from the United States based on criminal activity that criminal courts later find they did not commit. In a political climate in which immigration agents are adopting increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics, such broader latitude will certainly sweep more people into the immigration detention and deportation pipeline.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2238889106.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:00:10.082477

A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do – and left no way to address abuses.","Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into US cities, including Minneapolis, where agents have fatally shot two American citizen protesters in January.

Footage from bystanders of the two fatal shootings, including one by the border patrol that killed the ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.

Cameras worn by officers have long been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend of cameras for law enforcement. Officials in 2025 also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.

Darius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body-camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under the presidency of Joe Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.

In response to a request for comment, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities”.

At least three of the eight or more border patrol agents at the scene of Saturday’s shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.

When federal officers have engaged in acts of violence, including the fatal shootings of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on 7 January, top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations. Trump started ramping up immigration enforcement after Republicans in Congress passed a bill in the first year of his second presidency that provides $170bn for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and border patrol operate.

Pretti’s shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless it reins in immigration enforcement. US Customs and Border Protection – the border patrol’s parent agency – had 13,400 cameras for about 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.

ICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington DC.

While the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.

The proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.

The DHS says there are about 22,000 ICE officers, but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.

A homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives recently rejected that proposal, instead providing $20m for ICE and border patrol cameras.

Still, the bill – which now faces a challenging route to passage in the US Senate – did not require either agency to use the devices.

A top ICE official under Biden, Scott Shuchart, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations outside their normal operating area – an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.

The DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration placed about 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.

A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do – and left no way to address abuses.

In May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.

As of December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared with more than a hundred in March.

In 2023, the OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e2b8d4c140022d932f1df48413c0822dd93b26/188_0_1279_1023/master/1279.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=395254143212f7e6c9b1ba4ce80f48c8",N,,2026-01-26 09:58:09.160271

Democrats in the Senate are vowing to oppose a bill that would fund immigration enforcement, which could shut down the government.","Matthew Rose, an Opinion editorial director, hosted an online conversation with three Opinion columnists.

Matthew Rose: On Saturday, agents from the Border Patrol in Minneapolis shot and killed Alex Pretti, an American citizen. We don’t have a full accounting of what happened, but the available video evidence shows he was filming the agents with his phone, as many locals have done since the full weight of federal immigration enforcement descended on the city.

Lydia, you’ve been to Minneapolis recently. Tell us what you saw and give us some context for what just happened.

Lydia Polgreen: I have never been a fan of the conceit of American journalists covering the United States as if it were a backwater foreign nation, but in Minneapolis last week I could not shake the impulse to compare my experiences in a city I know so well (I spent a chunk of my childhood in the Twin Cities, and my father is from Minneapolis) with my experiences covering civil wars in places like Congo, Sudan, Sri Lanka and more. Watching the video of Pretti’s killing, I thought: If this was happening on the streets of any of those places, I would not hesitate to call it an extrajudicial execution by security forces. This is where we are: armed agents of the state killing civilians with an apparent belief in their total impunity.

I left before Pretti was gunned down, apparently in the back while he was on his knees. What I saw was so reminiscent of other conflicts — civilians doing their very best to protect themselves and their neighbors from seemingly random violence meted out by state agents. Those agents, masked and heavily armed, are roaming the streets and picking up and assaulting people for having the wrong skin color or accent, or being engaged in the constitutionally protected acts of filming, observing or protesting their presence. Anyone who knows me knows that I am allergic to hyperbole, but sometimes you need to simply call a spade a spade. This is a lawless operation.

David French: We are witnessing the total breakdown of any meaningful system of accountability for federal officials. The combination of Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons, his ongoing campaign of pardoning friends and allies, his politicized prosecutions and now his administration’s assurances that federal officers have immunity are creating a new legal reality in the United States. The national government is becoming functionally lawless, and the legal system is struggling to contain his corruption.

We’re tasting the bitter fruit of Trump’s dreadful policies, to be sure, but it’s worse than that. He’s exploiting years of legal developments that have helped insulate federal officials from both criminal and civil accountability. It’s as if we engineered a legal system premised on the idea that federal officials are almost always honest, and the citizens who critique them are almost always wrong. We’ve tilted the legal playing field against citizens and in favor of the government.

The Trump administration breaks the law, and also ruthlessly exploits all the immunities it’s granted by law. The situation is unsustainable for a constitutional republic.

Michelle Goldberg: The administration is very consciously reinforcing that sense of impunity. First there was Stephen Miller addressing the security forces after one of them killed Renee Good: “To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.” On Sunday, Greg Bovino, the self-consciously villainous Border Patrol commander, praised the agents who executed Alex Pretti.

I wish people weren’t allowed to carry guns in public. But they are, and after watching Republicans bring semiautomatic weapons to protest Covid closures and make a hero of Kyle Rittenhouse. So it’s wild to hear Federal Bureau of Investigation head Kash Patel say, on Fox News, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want.” The point here isn’t hypocrisy; it’s them nakedly asserting that constitutional rights are for us, not you.

Rose: David, I wanted to pick up on your description of the federal government as lawless. As you’ve written, we seem to be in the world described by Nazi-era Jewish labor lawyer Ernst Fraenkel and what he called “the dual state.” There is one we live in, where we pay taxes and go to work, and life seems to work according to common rules, and the other where the rules no longer apply. Is this what we’re experiencing?

French: We’re living in a version of the dual state. Not to the same extent as the Nazis, of course, but Fraenkel’s framing is still relevant. The Nazis didn’t create their totalitarian state immediately. Instead, they were able to lull much of the population to sleep just by keeping their lives relatively normal. As you say, they went to work, paid their taxes, entered into contracts and did all the things you normally do in a functioning nation. But if you crossed the government, then you passed into a different state entirely, where you would feel the full weight of fascist power — regardless of the rule of law.

One of the saddest things about the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti is that you could tell that neither of them seemed to know the danger until it was too late. They believed they were operating in some version of the normal state (what Fraenkel called the “normative state”) where the police usually respond with discipline and restraint.

Good and Pretti both had calm demeanors. They may have been annoying federal officers, but nothing about their posture indicated the slightest threat. Good even said, “I’m not mad” to the man who would gun her down seconds later. Pretti was filming with his phone in one hand and he had the other hand in the air as he was pepper-sprayed and tackled.

The officers, however, were in that different state, what Fraenkel called the “prerogative state,” where the government is a law unto itself. The officers acted violently, with impunity, and the government immediately acted to defend them and slander their victims. As the prerogative state expands, the normative state shrinks, and our lives often change before we can grasp what happened.

Polgreen: For me, this is what makes the community response in Minnesota so heartening. We’ve seen an astonishing outpouring of action and support from ordinary citizens who have decided not to accept this dual state. They refuse to be lulled, and insist on their continued citizenship in the constitutionally governed United States.

One thing that has irked me is how so many call the people out on the streets in Minnesota protesters. Yes, they are motivated by an urge to protest what is happening in their communities, and yes, protesting is an important act of citizenship. But what I saw in Minneapolis is better described as organizing and concerted action. It is an important distinction because so much of what is happening is invisible — people engaging in a form of neighborhood watch, walking vulnerable kids to school to shield them from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Church groups organizing food parcels for families too afraid to leave home. Community groups using encrypted messaging to compile spreadsheets of suspected ICE vehicles and activity. Others are logging and archiving endless amounts of evidence of ICE atrocities. This is the product of deep community organizing, not merely spontaneous actions driven by immediate anger.

Goldberg: I agree with Lydia and it’s the one thing that saves me from despair. Jews were less than 1 percent of the population in Hitler’s Germany. Trump is at war with a plurality of his country.

I’d love to know what you both think about the possibility of civil war or some kind of crackup. David, you wrote a whole book about the danger of the United States splitting up. I have to say, if I could vote in a referendum tomorrow for a national divorce from MAGA strongholds, I’d do it in a heartbeat. This is one of those ideas that I’ve flirted with in the past but always discounted because it means betraying a lot of people who’d be stuck in Trumpistan, and because it’s hard to see how you’d draw lines when the split is urban vs. rural as much as red state vs. blue. But it feels untenable to be ruled perpetually by people who’d murder us in the street and then slander us for it.

I was struck by the secretary of defense posting “ICE > MN” on social media. These are not people who think they share any bonds of citizenship with Democrats. Obviously, the answer is to win elections. But we’ve seen how Trump’s movement responds to losing elections, and that was before Trump had repurposed ICE as a personal militia.

Polgreen: We may yet come to an actual civil war, with armed people on different sides. Already, you have the local police in an uneasy middle ground between civilians and federal agents. Things could get worse if we end up with a National Guard, deployed by Gov. Tim Walz, and federal troops, deployed by Trump, at odds over who has the authority to exercise the state’s monopoly on violence.

In a way, the Trump administration has already started a civil war in which a set of leaders and citizens are behaving in a manner loyal to the historical traditions of our Constitution, and a president who believes his word is law and has surrounded himself with loyalists ready to dispense with their constitutional duty and execute his dark vision.

Michelle’s suggestion of a kind of national divorce is seductive at moments like this, but Minnesota is in many ways an illustration of why union is the only solution. Yes, it is a resolutely blue state in presidential elections, but it is quite closely contested in state and congressional elections, with all the urban-rural, blue-and-white-collar divisions you suggest. I am struck at how we’ve seen almost no counteraction from the right in Minnesota, which suggests to me that even some of the MAGA factions within the state are taken aback by the federal incursion’s indiscriminate violence, and sense the great cost to their state should it continue for much longer.

French: I think I wrote my book too soon! It came out in September of 2020 — this was after the racial reckoning and many of the Covid protests, but before Jan. 6 and the chaos of Trump’s second term. My thesis was pretty simple — that every single significant cultural, political or religious trend was pulling us apart more than it was pushing us together. And if we can’t find a way to reverse these seismic forces we would risk our national union.

Lots of readers thought I might have been too alarmist, but everything is unfolding as I have feared. We don’t have to debate whether some kind of national divorce is imminent (I don’t think it is) to understand that enmity between red and blue is still growing, and that the more hatred permeates our society, the more unstable it becomes. We are creating the conditions for a catastrophe.

I desperately want to preserve this union, but even more than that I want to preserve the idea that this nation is and can be an instrument of liberty, justice and virtue. And that means vanquishing the forces of hate and division, not separating from them.

Rose: With immigration enforcement in Trump’s second term, we have a quasi-military force, backed by more funding than most countries give their actual militaries, deployed for the most part to enforce civil, not criminal law. Should we instead think about this as spectacle? Caitlin Dickerson of The Atlantic, interviewed by our colleague Ezra Klein, argued that immigration enforcement under Trump is being implemented for maximum visual impact.

Goldberg: That’s increasingly the critique of conservatives who don’t want to break with Trump, but also are having a hard time rationalizing ICE’s violence in Minneapolis. Erick Erickson blames what’s happening in Minnesota on the D.H.S. secretary, Kristi Noem, marginalizing Tom Homan, the border czar, in favor of Greg Bovino from Customs and Border Protection, who clearly relishes street-level confrontation.

And the administration obviously wants to make a spectacle. We don’t know why the guy who shot Renee Good was filming, but it could well have been to feed their insatiable demand for content, which in turn is feeding their recruiting efforts. Did any of you see the clip where one of agents shooting tear gas at protesters can be heard saying, “It’s like ‘Call of Duty.’ So cool, huh?”

I’m glad that some people on the right have at least concluded that this looks bad for their side, since it could create political pressure on Trump to pull back. At the same time, I don’t think you can divorce the policy from the spectacle. Both are meant to terrorize their enemies.

Polgreen: There is no question that spectacle is the goal here. Michelle just mentioned Bovino — he has been swanning about Minnesota in a long, green wool coat that lends him a distinctly fascist look. The way these officers are kitted out is nuts. Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, described it to me as “full battle rattle.” There is also a cartoonish aspect to the whole thing — social media is replete with videos of agents slipping on ice and falling, ass-over-teakettle, onto the frozen ground. You look at the videos of the shootings and there is an air of incompetence to the whole thing, even amid the horror. It is almost as if you can’t believe how amateurish and unprofessional these guys are.

Elliott Payne, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, told me about one encounter with an agent armed with a Taser. The guy held it sideways, like some kind of gangbanger, menacing Payne and other city officials as they tried to ask questions about why a man at a bus stop was being detained. Payne told me it was something out of a bad movie. No trained law enforcement officer would ever hold a weapon that way. It would be comical if it weren’t so utterly terrifying.

French: I think the administration has done a very effective job at convincing its supporters that enforcement might be messy, but the Democrats left them with no choice. This is what we have to do to protect our nation’s borders, deport criminal aliens, and preserve economic opportunity for Americans. It’s this, they argue, or you have open borders and complete chaos. I hear that sentiment all the time.

That’s a false choice. We can protect our border and enforce immigration laws without a violent, masked paramilitary force taking over our city streets. Presidents of both parties have deported millions of undocumented immigrants without resort to brutality and violence.

There are multiple purposes behind Trump’s aggression. He’s certainly trying to impress his supporters and intimidate his opponents. But he’s also trying to bait his opponents into extremism and violence in response. I’m afraid that he wants riots and a rerun of rhetoric like “defund the police.”

It is vitally important to respond to Trump’s extremism not with an opposing extreme, but rather with reason, good sense and peaceful, courageous conviction. Call his bluff. Show America that it’s not a binary choice between brutal enforcement or unrestrained immigration.

Rose: Recent polling suggests Americans don’t like ICE’s tactics, nor do they approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, but they still trust Republicans more than Democrats, generally, on the topic. Do any of you see an elected official of either party expressing anything akin to the French Theory of Immigration: Protect the border without the masked paramilitaries?

Goldberg: Isn’t this what basically every Democrat is saying? Even the people who are saying “abolish ICE” aren’t calling for an end to immigration enforcement. They’re arguing that this is a rogue agency beyond repair, and they’re right.

I understand why the “abolish ICE” debate has immediately become about polling and midterm politics. Democrats need to win, and they’re still stung by the backlash to “defund the police.” But before we debate messaging, I think we should talk about the substantive issue, which is that ICE, an organization that’s only 23 years old, has become a vehicle of state terror that must be disbanded.

One thing I learned from Ezra’s interview with Caitlin Dickerson is that most ICE agents have been hired in the past year. Many of them are people who responded to a recruitment drive that targeted gun shows, far-right influencers and overt white nationalists. They are showing every day that they are thuggish and unprofessional and regard many of their fellow citizens as their enemies. No politician should be so abject as to fund their own occupiers.

French: I like the idea of getting aggressive and specific in response. Take off their masks. End their immunities. Limit their jurisdiction. Restrain their tactics. All of this can be done through legislation without inhibiting humane immigration enforcement. And if it’s done correctly, legislative reform can lead to greater accountability across the whole of government.

Goldberg: David, do you really think the people who currently make up ICE are capable of humane immigration enforcement?

French: Some, yes and some, no. But you will make ICE infinitely less attractive to thugs and goons if they know they can be held immediately accountable, if they will never get to run around in their ridiculous military-style uniforms (cosplaying like they’re SEALs), and if they can’t break down doors or rappel from helicopters to check a person’s immigration status.

Goldberg: There’s a proposal in Maryland, the ICE Breaker Act, which would bar people hired by ICE under Trump from working in state law enforcement. I’d like to see similar efforts everywhere to increase the stigma of this work, even though the downside is redoubling their commitment to keeping Republicans in office.

French: Hmm. I’m not a fan. I think it’s a mistake to conclude that everyone who joins is nefarious. There are people who join, object to what they’re asked to do, and leave. Or blow the whistle and leave. I don’t want that person inhibited by a scarlet “I” for the rest of their professional life.

Also, Michelle, the downside you identify is pretty big. We don’t want even more people to believe that everything depends on the G.O.P. clinging to power.

Polgreen: David makes a really good point here — this is an emergency, but we do need to think about the future, and how we knit ourselves back together again. As someone who served in our Forever Wars, I am sure he knows many people who signed up for one mission out of patriotism and ended up with deep misgivings and regrets.

French: I absolutely do.

Polgreen: A lot of people in politics and punditry are overthinking this. It has been clear for a very long time that the general voting public wants a secure border and immigration reform. Anyone claiming that Americans voted for today’s insane policies is lying to themselves. I get frustrated with people who say stuff like, “This is not who we are,” because the United States has a long history of doing terrible things to its citizens and those who seek to make a home here. But I also get frustrated with people who argue that, “This is what America has always been,” because that, too, is fantasy.

The truth is that Americans are proud that their country is the destination of choice for the most ambitious and talented people in the world, and for anyone yearning for freedom under law. And I believe that fundamental to the American psyche is a belief that we are a nation built on a set of ideals, however imperfect our loyalty to those ideals.

Rose: You’ve touched on this already, but it’s worth pausing to consider what’s coming this week. Democrats in the Senate are vowing to oppose a bill that would fund immigration enforcement, which could shut down the government. What should they be asking for?

Goldberg: First and foremost, the withdrawal of ICE from Minneapolis.

Polgreen: I think this is the moment for Democrats to be quite ambitious. Michelle, I agree — ICE needs to leave Minnesota. There is simply no justification for this kind of deployment in a state with so few undocumented immigrants — as a proportion of its population it is less than half the national average.

At an absolute minimum, Democrats should demand an end to masking, a ban on military-style uniforms and a requirement that officers wear badges with identification. The feds must agree to independent investigations of uses of deadly force, and dispense with the fiction of immunity. I think Kristi Noem needs to go, but then whoever replaces her could be even worse.

I think it is quite disgusting that seven moderate Democrats in the House voted for this funding, including media darlings like Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Jared Golden of Maine. Democrats need to wake up and realize what time it is. This simply cannot stand.

French: I very much like the Lydia plan. No masks. No immunities. No military-style tactics or uniforms. You don’t need any of those things to protect the border and enforce immigration laws. And yes, end the Minneapolis operation. Now. Don’t make MAGA defend border enforcement. Make them defend the indefensible.

Rose: Two quick questions to finish. First, when people ask you what they can do, what’s your advice?

French: This is a crucial moment in American history. I think about it like this — when we learn about our family histories, we often ask what our ancestors were doing. Did they serve in World War II? Did they serve in Vietnam? Where did they stand during the civil rights movement?

This is a moment important enough that our grandchildren and even great-grandchildren might ask: “What did you know? What did you do?” Think hard about what you want your answer to be. Think hard about what you can do that will stand the test of time — whether it be peacefully protesting (including peaceful civil disobedience), volunteering for a political campaign, providing meals and clothing for immigrant families, or anything else that protects the vulnerable and defends human dignity.

One of the worst answers, however, would be to look a curious grandchild in the face, and say, “Well, I posted a lot on social media.”

Polgreen: I read so much about how we live in an atomized society, glued to our phones and social media but untethered from our communities and neighbors. Minnesota is demonstrating how quickly and fearlessly communities can come together in spite of the political and technological forces seeking to keep us divided. They also built on their past experience — many of these networks of support began during the George Floyd protests. Some were groups that wanted to march against the Minneapolis cops, and others wanted to protect neighborhoods from property damage. Now they have been reactivated to work together to help each other. A lot of us formed these kinds of networks during Covid. This would be a great time to reconnect with them. Be prepared to protect the people around you.

French: I love this emphasis on connection, Lydia.

Goldberg: Yeah, Lydia, I agree. There are a couple of women on my block — and I hope they won’t mind me referring to them — who are just phenomenal organizers, both politically and socially. One of them is the planner of the block party and the keeper of the free library; this morning I saw her out shoveling snow, not just in front of her own house but in front of those on either side of her. They’re also the ones who are handing out ICE whistles and holding weekly neighborhood meetings and protests.

I wrote in one of my columns that these anti-ICE actions are signs of local civic health. They come, ironically, out of the sort of deep local ties and resulting social trust that conservatives constantly say they want to recreate. So one thing you can do — depending on where you live, of course — is to meet your neighbors, and start talking to them about what you’re going to do if ICE descends.

Rose: And what have you seen that’s been heartening?

French: I’ll be completely honest. It’s a little harder for me to have hope when I know that the core political support for Trump’s aggression is coming from my own community. Without the lock step (and seemingly unconditional) support of so many millions of Evangelicals, Trump’s administration would crumble overnight. So I keep looking for signs of softening hearts and opening minds in Trump’s base — among the people who helped raise me, who taught me about faith, and who told me in no uncertain terms that politicians must demonstrate high character before they can earn your support. I feel a pervasive sadness about this moment.

That’s what is so grievous about civil strife. You often find yourself in opposition not to some hated, distant foe, but rather in opposition to people you’ve loved your whole life — whom you still love.

But there is hope. It’s a mistake to believe that the G.O.P. and its Christian supporters have crossed a Rubicon, never to return. And it’s a mistake to believe — even for the most hardhearted — that their aggression is a sign of their strength. They are masking weakness, and courage is their kryptonite.

Polgreen: I share David’s wariness of hope, which is very much warranted. Still, seeing the huge turnout in subzero temperatures on Friday in Minneapolis was incredibly moving. When I was in Minnesota, high school students in St. Paul staged a walkout and marched to the State Capitol. It was so very cold, but they came in their hundreds, an incredibly diverse group of kids.

I met a group of white teenage boys, the demographic supposedly lured in my Trump’s embrace of masculine cruelty. And they just weren’t having it. They talked about a kind of masculinity that involved sticking up for the vulnerable, being of service to your community, being a leader in your church and school. When I heard about Alex Pretti’s background — a boy scout, athlete, I.C.U. nurse caring for veterans — I instantly thought of those warm, kind Midwestern boys as his spiritual kin. That spirit lives on.

Goldberg: Watching ordinary people in Minneapolis stand up to ICE has filled me with an almost hokey degree of patriotism. It turns out there are still a lot of Americans with that deep instinct for associational life that Tocqueville wrote about.

By addressing these concerns, the U.S. can strive toward a more just approach to immigration enforcement.","ICE has deported roughly 540,000 people since Trump took office for his second presidential term in January 2025.

On January 7, 2026, an ICE agent killed an American citizen. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother living in Minneapolis, was shot to death in her vehicle by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Good’s death is now ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. Since an ICE agent committed the killing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office claimed exclusive federal jurisdiction and blocked Minnesota state officials from obtaining evidence.

On January 24, 2026, another American citizen was killed during an ICE operation. Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse also from Minneapolis, was shot to death in the street by a yet-unnamed agent. Federal authorities have described the shooting as an act of self-defense, but multiple videos of the encounter appear to conflict with that account, showing Pretti unarmed and being subdued at the time he was shot. This analysis is being published in the aftermath of the incident, while much about it is under investigation and still unknown.

Some people may call it ironic that the city where George Floyd was murdered is the same one where two white citizens were killed during protests against what others refer to as a hostile military government takeover. We call it, unfortunately, predictable. Many cities have seen ICE surges, including Washington, DC, Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, New Orleans, Brownsville, TX, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Minneapolis.

In several of these places, there are reports of ICE using excessive force, such as in the case of Julio Sosa-Celis, and of U.S. citizens being arrested or detained based on their accent or appearance, including Native Americans. This is also unfortunately predictable, as work from Brookings has identified how racial profiling by ICE would impact US citizens who are perceived to be immigrants from particular countries. The arrests of Ramon Menera and Chong Ly Thao are emblematic of this pattern.

On January 20, a 5-year-old with a pending asylum case was apprehended by ICE as he arrived home from preschool. School officials say he was used “as bait” to attempt to arrest other family members and members of his community.

Despite the Trump administration claiming they are targeting criminals, one-third of people arrested do not have a criminal record. In over 50 cases, ICE has allegedly busted out car windows to justify arrests. Overall, 32 people died while in ICE custody in 2025.

In response to ICE operations, Minneapolis and other cities have seen tens of thousands of protesters descend into the streets.

Absolute immunity, federal power, and echoes of the Civil Rights era

The Trump administration has argued for “absolute immunity” for ICE officers, which would lead to lawsuits being dismissed without the investigative discovery phase. The public feels differently: 60% of Americans believe ICE uses excessive force. Absolute immunity, compared to qualified immunity, protects agents regardless of whether they knowingly violate “clearly established” laws regarding excessive force or probable cause.

Sociologists and political scientists situate ICE’s actions as representing a crisis of legitimacy and a structural violence regime infiltrating the criminal justice system. What that means is that American streets have felt dystopian in ways that mirror less politically-stable countries. Police have taken a back seat in the headlines, though incidents of excessive force from law enforcement continue to occur (police killed over 1,300 people in 2025, despite local reforms to counter police violence and bias—a number that is higher than any year over the past decade, except for 2024).

We are also seeing Trump “federalize” the National Guard to support federal law enforcement operations as logistical support. This approach has been critiqued by some who view the Trump administration as being in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military as domestic law enforcement. In December 2025, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot use the National Guard for normal enforcement. Violence against National Guard members involved in domestic operations has also occurred, as in the case of Sarah Beckstrom, a member of the West Virginia National Guard, who was killed the day before Thanksgiving by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who also shot Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe in the head. Sgt. Wolfe recently started breathing on his own and standing with assistance.

Collectively, today’s images of law enforcement interactions with people living in the U.S. are reminiscent of an unstable Civil Rights movement period. But at that time, the National Guard and local police were doing the enforcement, not ICE. This is an important distinction that makes the current phase feel much different than prior eras of civil unrest. Sanchez, an author of this piece who has studied immigration and politics for decades, argues that the actions of ICE officers and statements from the Trump administration have radically shifted societal norms in ways that will have lasting consequences.

How ICE agents are being recruited today

ICE was formed in 2003 as part of a reorganization following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ICE is housed in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Different from local police, who report to mayors and county executives (or governors, in the case of state agencies), and the National Guard, who mostly report to governors as a military force, ICE is part of a federal agency where the president has more influence. While previous presidents have primarily deployed Border Patrol to enforce immigration violations at the border and used Homeland Security to investigate more severe criminal cases related to drug and human trafficking, President Trump has been much more likely to deploy the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Division within ICE to actively seek out people whom agents suspect of being illegal.

What makes this wave of ICE action different is how agents are being recruited and trained. With about $170 billion going to immigration enforcement and border security from Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” ICE has significantly expanded hiring. The agency is giving $50,000 signing bonuses and providing student loan forgiveness with the goal of doubling its workforce and meeting the president’s benchmark of deporting one million people annually. In doing so, ICE has lowered the age limit of its recruits from 21 to 18 and waived the 37-year-old hiring cap; these age boundaries apply to most federal law enforcement agencies to ensure the agents’ physical fitness. Since Trump retook office, ICE has hired over 12,000 new agents and expanded its headcount to over 22,000. However, there are reports of a decrease in rigor for selection: Investigative journalist Laura Jadeed reported attending an ICE career expo and being hired after six minutes without completing any background paperwork.

In her forthcoming book Cutting the Government: The Right Way and the Wrong Way, Brookings Senior Fellow Elaine Kamarck argues that ICE’s hiring and personnel protocols are further complicated by its heavy reliance on other agencies to carry out immigration enforcement. She notes a Cato Institute study finding that ICE receives assistance from nearly 17,000 non-ERO personnel (including roughly 14,500 federal criminal-law-enforcement officers), highlighting how immigration enforcement is diffused across multiple agencies. FBI agents are moved to assist ICE, which means that other functions, such as counterterrorism, have to be carried out with fewer people and resources. Agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have also been transferred to assist with deportations. The Trump administration has also shifted roughly 600 Department of Defense lawyers (with only two weeks of training) to address the massive immigration backlog from DHS.

Lower training standards

In addition to questionable hiring practices and leaving potential gaps in the nation’s other law enforcement needs, shortened training is problematic. The ICE Academy has been reduced from 22 weeks to 8 weeks or 47 days (a number supposedly chosen because Trump is the 47th president). The previously required 5 weeks of Spanish language training were removed, and agents are being told to rely on mobile apps for translation. Instead of a focus on understanding the Immigration and Nationality Act, trainees are engaging in more tactical and operational drills. Instead of a 4-week in-person training, police officers being deputized to work with ICE are now only required to do a 40-hour online course.

This watering down of hiring and training standards is concerning. Ray, the co-author of this article, has served on Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) commissions to help psychologists better evaluate police applicants for bias. One common trend over the past few years was that short-staffed police departments increasingly accepted applicants who would have been rejected in years prior. These hiring challenges raise, then, an urgent question: who are the new ICE recruits, and are their qualifications sufficient if they are receiving less training than before and yet being quickly deployed into U.S. communities? Ray has researched law enforcement for over 15 years, trained police officers, helped develop a virtual reality training program for law enforcement, and testified before Congress on policing. Simply put, training cannot be rushed and often should be increased.

The lack of training leads to mistakes. In law enforcement, mistakes get people killed.

Steps to reduce violence immediately

Accordingly, there are a series of measures that can be implemented immediately to reduce the use of force and improve decision-making.

First, hiring standards should be improved. ICE agents’ files should be cross-checked with state-level misconduct files. This aligns with Texas’s Wandering Officer Law to prevent people who were fired or resigned due to misconduct from working in law enforcement.

Second, training should be enhanced. De-escalation training, such as Jigsaw’s virtual reality training, can improve communication and decision-making in high-stakes situations. This training is mobile and can be easily deployed in various settings.

Third, Duty to Intervene should be mandated. Law enforcement agents, regardless of agency, should prevent a fellow officer or agent from using excessive force. This recommendation aligns with the Minneapolis Police Department’s cross-agency intervention policy.

Fourth, transparency must improve. Agents should use body-worn cameras and official vehicles with insignia, and masks that cover the faces of agents should not be allowed. This recommendation aligns with laws requiring that agents “unmask” or “de-mask,” with the assumption that more transparency will lead to reduced use of force.

Fifth, absolute immunity should be removed, and investigations into instances of wrongdoing by federal agents should be pursued.

There are other proposals and decisions of note that are aiming to address actions by ICE:

Lawmakers are already discussing reforms that include some of the recommendations mentioned above, such as requiring agents to provide first aid (when Good was killed, ICE agents did not allow a physician at the scene to render aid) or prohibiting provisional hiring without a complete background check.

A Minnesota federal judge restricted ICE’s use of retaliation against peaceful protesters. Some readers may be thinking: Isn’t this already the law? Well, this is the point. The legal and cultural norms that most Americans assumed were cemented into our democratic culture have been so upended that judges have to restate the basics of constitutional protest rights.

Maryland is discussing measures to prohibit people who join ICE from obtaining law enforcement jobs in the state. Critics argue that employees working for the federal government cannot be discriminated against when pursuing employment.

Finally, the DHS appropriation bill that Congress aims to pass by the end of January would require DHS to spend $20 million on body cameras for immigration enforcement agents and direct the department to expand training on conflict de-escalation during public interactions. In the aftermath of Pretti’s killing, a growing number of Democratic senators have announced that they will not support the bill,

Altogether, as ICE continues to face allegations over its methods, fostering a system built on fairness and respect for human rights becomes paramount. By addressing these concerns, the U.S. can strive toward a more just approach to immigration enforcement.

Ultimately, the goal should be to safeguard two things at the same time: national security, and the dignity and rights of every individual within our borders.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256086780-2.jpg?quality=75,N,,2026-01-26 09:58:17.907868

Share January – Minnesota becomes the test case for military takeover of a US city by ICE and other federal immigration agents.
On 7 January 2026, US citizen Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agents, while trying to get out of their way.
JD Vance said afterwards that ICE agents had “absolute immunity” (a claim he has later walked back).
The lawlessness of ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies has been increasing – and been increasingly blatant – for the last year.","What we are seeing in Minneapolis right now is horrendous, frightening, and heartbreaking. But it is not a surprise. Over the past year, the Trump administration has deliberately escalated immigration enforcement - expanding funding and capacity for ICE, normalising violent and racist rhetoric, and expanding legal support for immigration enforcement while stripping back oversight. On the ground, federal immigration agents have grown bolder and more aggressive.

Where we are now traces directly back to the very beginning of Trump’s second term. In this post I trace out the actions since January 2025, highlighting the key events that tell the story of how we ended up here.

Below is a chart of actions over the last year – I’ve logged almost 200 and so have only been able to label the most significant on the chart below (high resolution version). The full list, along with links to relevant news stories, can be accessed here.

The first nine months: removing guardrails, increasing funding, desensitising the population

On his first day in office, Trump signed a Proclamation titled “Guaranteeing The States Protection Against Invasion”. This classified southern border crossings as an “invasion” and authorised the Department for Homeland Security (DHS), under which ICE sits, to take “all appropriate action” to “repel, repatriate, or remove” people deemed part of that invasion. Two days later, DHS signed an additional memo authorising ICE agents to expel 1.4 million immigrants who had been allowed to remain under Biden-era policies. The scene was set for the mass deportation efforts to follow.

In March 2025, three watchdogs agencies within DHS were shut down removing important oversight of ICE activities. DHS started deporting Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador’s notorious prison CECOT without due process. By Spring, ICE is arresting people as they turn up for their immigration hearings, wrongly arrests US citizens, all while reports of human rights abuses in detention facilities increase. In May 2025, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrongly asserts that the president has “a constitutional right” to deport people without due process.

In terms of building capacity, Trump increased ICE’s budget by $70 billion over four years, a six-fold increase. The American Immigration Council called this “a fundamental reshaping of American society” and said that ICE “would become more powerful than every other federal law enforcement agency”. ICE also started to ramp up its surveillance technologies, with facial recognition apps, spyware, and sharing of sensitive federal data, while some paperwork requirements for arrests were scrapped and funding for bodycams cut. Meanwhile, ICE started a recruitment drive, offering signing-on bonuses and lowering entry requirements.

June saw the National Guard and marines deployed to Los Angeles, followed by DC. Concentrated ICE and Border Patrol deployments targeted LA, Portland, DC, Memphis, New York and Chicago over the summer and early autumn. The National Guard in DC go from being unarmed, to being “maybe armed”, to all being armed. The Department for Homeland Security (DHS) refuses to comply with state rules on identification, and agents continue to detain people while wearing face masks and plain clothes and using unmarked cars.

Dissent is legislated against and punished. In late August, Trump signs an Executive Order to establish specialised National Guard units to address “public order issues”. The next day, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, calls the Democrat Party “a domestic extremist organization” for opposing deployment of the National Guard in DC. US politicians are arrested for demanding access to ICE facilities in New York and DHS threatens federal assault charges against anyone ‘attacking’ ICE agents. In mid September, ICE agents kill a man in a Chicago while trying to arrest him – and are later shown to have lied about what happened.

I believe that the summer gave the administration the reassurance it needed so that it could escalate ICE tactics. While there had been many civilian protests against ICE and National Guard deployment, and many successful legal challenges, Congress did not step in, Fox News and the MAGA base stayed onside. It was safe to continue.

An autumn of increasing brutality, lawlessness and violent rhetoric

By early October, Trump had called Portland, Oregon “war-ravaged” and authorised “full force” against anyone ‘threatening’ ICE facilities. A few days later, Trump suggested that the military could use “dangerous cities” as “training grounds”. ICE had spent more than $70m on new weapons in 2025 and at least 16 deaths of detainees held in ICE facilities had been recorded since January.

In late October, Stephen Miller said anyone interfering in ICE operations could be arrested for engaging in “criminal conspiracy” against the US. Trump said he’s prepared to send “more than the National Guard” into American cities and the Pentagon ordered states’ National Guard units to form “quick reaction forces” for “crowd control”. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) increasingly painted opponents to ICE activity as “domestic terrorists” and as “lawless”.

In early November, a US citizen is shot (but not killed) from behind by ICE agents. The only consequence is that ICE is trying to prosecute him for “assault”, alleging he tried to run them over. The latest ICE operation – this time targeting Minnesota – is announced on 2 December.

Recruitment drives for ICE continue into winter, the Southern border is increasingly militarised, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is providing passenger lists to immigration enforcement. By Christmas, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserts (wrongly) that recording or following ICE agents is “obstruction of justice”, despite it being protected free speech. This argument will be repeatedly used to justify violence against – and the killing of – observers and protesters in January.

January – Minnesota becomes the test case for military takeover of a US city by ICE and other federal immigration agents.

The first few weeks of 2026 have seen Minneapolis at the centre of the deportation effort – and of lawful protest and observation. ICE agents have been testing the limits of what they can get away with. So far, the administration has protected and even celebrated their violence.

On 7 January 2026, US citizen Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agents, while trying to get out of their way. The administration immediately characterised her as a “domestic terrorist” who was trying to run over and kill the agents. Video directly contradicted this account. An autopsy released by her family showed that the first two bullets were not life-threatening, but the third killed her – when an ICE agent leaned into the driver’s side window and shot her in the head at close range. JD Vance said afterwards that ICE agents had “absolute immunity” (a claim he has later walked back). The investigation was taken over by the central FBI, with local law enforcement excluded. A civil rights case opened to investigate her shooting was altered to be an investigation of Renee Good for “criminal activity” (and later thrown out by a judge). Good’s widowed wife is being investigated as a potential terrorist. The Department of Justice has now confirmed it sees no need to investigate Good’s death.

Since then, DHS promised to send another 1,000 agents to Minnesota. Federal immigration agents in Minnesota have been filmed breaking into a US citizen’s house and dragging him out in his underwear in subzero temperatures; arresting a 5-year old boy on his way home from school and then his dad (both are still in custody); pepper spraying an observer directly in the face while restraining them on the ground; pepper spraying the Minnesota Attorney General at close range; and deploying tear gas against a family of six in their car, resulting in their baby needing hospital. And those are just a fraction of the stories.

The administration has leaned into white supremacist imagery and defence of ICE. Trump threatened to invoke the insurrection act in Minnesota, with 1,500 troops reported to be on standby in Alaska. Civil rights and the rule of law were further weakened. Kristi Noem said ICE was allowed to ask citizens for their citizenship papers. Minnesota’s governor, attorney general, and Minneapolis’ mayor have all been targeted for judicial investigation into ‘obstruction’ of ICE activities.

Elsewhere, a Cuban immigrant was killed in detention while being held in a chokehold by staff. A new ICE operation began in Maine, explicitly targeting Somali immigrants.

And then, on Saturday, federal immigration agents restrained, then killed, US citizen Alex Pretti, who was helping a fellow protester in Minneapolis after she was pushed to the ground by agents. They sprayed him in the face with pepper spray, wrestled him to the ground, and then fatally shot him multiple times. It was witnessed and multiple videos exist showing the shooting from different angles.

The administration has repeatedly lied about what happened, falsely asserting that Pretti was threatening agents and attempting to shoot them, while local police say that the Department of Homeland Security is taking control of the investigation and blocking their access to evidence. Trump, Hegseth, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller have all backed ICE and Border Patrol.

On thin ICE?

The lawlessness of ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies has been increasing – and been increasingly blatant – for the last year. So far, the administration has covered for them, celebrated them, enabled them, and funded them. Minnesotans have shown how concerted and coordinated local action can make a difference and the crucial importance of witnessing, and recording, what is happening.

Calls are growing, including from former President Obama, for proper investigations and an end to ICE’s deliberate brutality in Democrat cities. Some Republicans are also now speaking up, calling for investigations and questioning the immigration crackdown.

Will Trump and his team listen? If they don’t, will a Republican-led Congress finally assert its authority through legislation, hearings, appropriations powers and even impeachment? Because if there are no consequences to the violence we are witnessing, then it will keep spreading. That is what unchecked power does.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!INO9!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55cc5709-8454-4ee0-83b9-7d0ad30a07f6_6042x3692.png",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:18.342515

Based on what you know, was the shooting of the man in Minneapolis justified or not justified?","After federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a Minneapolis resident for the second time this month, more Americans now say they would support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) than say they would oppose eliminating the agency. A majority of Americans say ICE's tactics are too forceful and about half say they strongly disapprove of the way the agency is handling its job, according to a YouGov Poll conducted hours after the shooting. More Americans approve than disapprove of protests against ICE. Because the poll was conducted so soon after the shooting in Minneapolis, some respondents who were not aware of the news when they answered the questions might hear about it in subsequent days.

Another poll conducted the day after the shooting found that about half of Americans say the shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti was not justified, while only 20% said it was justified. The gap is even larger among Americans who have seen video of the shooting, nearly two-thirds of whom say it was not justified. While ICE has been the subject of protests since the first killing in Minneapolis — of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross — the shooter in this case worked for the Border Patrol, another agency in the Department of Homeland Security that was supporting ICE's operations in the city. Americans' opinions toward the Border Patrol are not as negative as views of ICE, though Americans who have seen video of the killing are more likely to have an unfavorable than a favorable opinion of the Border Patrol.

These latest results show an increase in opposition to ICE compared to two YouGov polls fielded earlier in January after the killing of Good. At that point, support for abolishing ICE was already at the highest level ever observed in YouGov polls.

Opposition to ICE has grown in January

More Americans support than oppose abolishing ICE (46% vs. 41%). This marks a slight increase from earlier this month, when three YouGov polls found that the share of Americans who supported eliminating ICE as a federal agency was roughly equal to the share who opposed it: 46% to 43% in one poll, 42% vs. 45% in another, and 45% vs. 45% in a third.

Democrats overwhelmingly support eliminating ICE (76% vs. 15%), as do nearly half of Independents (47% vs. 35%). Most Republicans (73%) continue to oppose abolishing ICE. Only 19% of Republicans support eliminating the agency, but that's a higher level than in any of the polls from earlier this month.

A majority (57%) of Americans somewhat or strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. Only 37% approve. Among Americans who have strong opinions about ICE, the divide is even starker. About half (48%) of Americans strongly disapprove, twice as many as the share who strongly approve: about one-quarter (23%).

Majorities of Democrats (83%) and Independents (54%) strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. In contrast, about half (51%) of Republicans strongly approve of ICE's job handling and only 7% strongly disapprove.

Views of ICE's tactics may contribute to the growing disapproval of the agency. A majority (58%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. That's a 5-percentage-point increase from earlier this month, when 53% said ICE was too forceful. Today, only 23% of Americans say that ICE's tactics are about right and 10% say they are not forceful enough.

Most Democrats (90%) and Independents (62%) say that ICE is too forceful. Republicans are much more likely to say that ICE's tactics are about right (49%). The remaining Republicans are about evenly split between saying ICE is too forceful and saying that it is not forceful enough (22% vs. 21%). Very few Democrats or Independents say that ICE is not forceful enough.

About half (49%) of Americans somewhat or strongly approve of protests against ICE actions, compared to 41% who disapprove. Most Democrats (79%) approve of such protests. Independents are more likely to approve than disapprove of them (49% vs. 35%). In contrast, only 20% of Republicans approve of protests against ICE, while 71% disapprove. Support for protests against ICE is essentially unchanged from earlier in January.

Few Americans think the shooting of Alex Pretti was justified

About half (48%) of Americans say the shooting of Pretti on Saturday in Minneapolis was not justified, while only 20% say it was justified. The gap is even larger among the majority (58%) of Americans who have seen video of the shooting. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of those who have seen video of the shooting say it was not justified, compared to just one-quarter (25%) who say it was not justified. This is similar to the results of an experiment conducted by YouGov with the Economist after the first shooting in Minneapolis: People who were shown a video of the shooting were more likely to say it was not justified. It also may reflect that more Democrats than Republicans have seen video of the shooting.

Democrats overwhelmingly say the shooting was not justified (83%), as do half of Independents (50%, compared to 13% who say it was justified). Republicans are much more likely to say the shooting was justified. The share of Republicans who say the shooting was justified (44%) is about the same as the share who say they're not sure if it was justified (43%). Few Republicans (13%) say the shooting was not justified.

Americans are slightly more likely to express favorable than unfavorable opinions of the Border Patrol (45% vs. 42%), the agency whose officer killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday. This can largely be attributed to Republicans' extremely positive evaluations of the agency: 83% of Republicans view the agency favorably, while only 7% have unfavorable opinions. In contrast, Independents are more likely to view the Border Patrol unfavorably than to view it favorably (48% vs. 34%) and most Democrats (73%) have unfavorable opinions of the agency while only 17% view it favorably.

Americans who have seen video of Saturday's shooting are much more likely to express negative views of the Border Patrol: A majority (53%) of Americans who have seen video of the shooting have an unfavorable opinion of the Border Patrol, compared to 41% who view the agency favorably. On the other hand, 52% of Americans who have not seen video of the shooting have a favorable opinion of the Border Patrol, while only 31% express an unfavorable opinion of the agency.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge will hear arguments Monday on whether she should at least temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that has led to the fatal shootings of two people by government officers.

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Saturday's shooting by a Border Patrol officer of Alex Pretti has only added urgency to the case.

Since the original filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request. They're trying to restore the state of affairs that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

The hearing is set for Monday morning in federal court in Minneapolis. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he plans to personally attend.

They're asking that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Menendez order federal law enforcement agencies to reduce the numbers of officers and agents in Minnesota to levels before the surge, while allowing them to continue to enforce immigration laws within a long list of proposed limits.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit “legally frivolous” and said ""Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement.” They asked the judge to reject the request or or at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Ellison said at a news conference Sunday that he and the cities filed their lawsuit because of “the unprecedented nature of this of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we’re looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we’ve seen something like this.”

It wasn't clear ahead of the hearing when the judge might rule.

The case also has implications for other states that have been or could be targets of intensive federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,” the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez is the same judge who ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who aren’t obstructing authorities, including people who are following and observing agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday’s shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing. The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, late Saturday issued an order blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

“The fact that anyone would ever think that an agent of the federal government might even think about doing such a thing was completely unforeseeable only a few weeks ago,"" Ellison told reporters. “But now, this is what we have to do.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c2/6c26a007-9a4e-5ff6-a33a-1b713f153292/69775b28ee301.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-26 08:57:47.225111

The organisation warned that the United States risked becoming a “model for strongmen” and “a warning rather than an inspiration”, while stressing that its protest was in solidarity with the American people.

The gathering will take place at 6:30pm.

In an open letter to Farkas, who recently took up her post, Repubblika said it had “followed with horror the growing number of deaths associated with immigration enforcement and detention” in the United States, referring to what it described as “murders and cruel atrocities currently being committed in America under the guise of enforcing immigration laws”.

The organisation said there were “credible reports of systemic abuse, medical neglect and excessive use of force”, stressing that these were “not isolated incidents”, and highlighted what it called the “distressing” treatment of minors by immigration authorities.

The NGO’s intervention follows the fatal shooting of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis over the weekend, the second recent ICE-related fatal shooting in the city, as well as reports that a five-year-old boy was detained while returning home from school. Repubblika said US human rights and civil society organisations had described the incidents as “cruel, disproportionate and incompatible with the rule of law”, warning that federal methods were beginning to resemble those of authoritarian regimes.

Repubblika also referred to recent public comments by Farkas, who in a video posted on the US embassy’s social media channels last week said she would not hesitate to promote President Donald Trump’s political agenda in Malta. While the ambassador said the US and Malta were bound by shared democratic values and a commitment to peace and prosperity, Repubblika said it was “profoundly disturbed” by the agenda being pursued by the US administration, arguing that current policies could not be reconciled with democratic principles traditionally associated with American leadership.

“Most people would look at that video (of Good being shot) and say, ‘File that lawsuit, go get justice,’” attorney Antonio Romanucci told me. But suing the federal government is a complex undertaking, he said, involving knotty questions of legal immunity and constitutional law – even as he described the legal path the family might take.

Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter. Sign up here.

Good, 37, was shot dead in her car on Jan. 7 by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. U.S. officials allege she attempted to run him over; her defenders say video shows she steered away. Her death preceded the fatal shooting of a Minnesota man, Alex Pretti, on Saturday by U.S. immigration agents.

The U.S. Justice Department and ICE did not respond to requests for comment on Good's shooting. The Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis shot Pretti in self-defense after he approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, but video reviewed by Reuters contradicted that account.

As my colleague Jan Wolfe has reported, suing individual government agents is exceedingly difficult. An alternative is the Federal Tort Claims Act, a 1946 law that establishes government liability for injuries or deaths caused by federal employees acting within the scope of their jobs.

Punitive damages, which can dramatically increase awards, are barred, as are jury trials. In addition to injury and death claims, plaintiffs can seek compensation for emotional distress or pain and suffering, said Romanucci, a co-founder of Chicago-based Romanucci & Blandin who also represented the family of George Floyd.

For a case to succeed, however, plaintiffs often must overcome a major hurdle: the discretionary function exception.

If the government invokes the defense, a court will determine whether a federal employee's conduct involved making a judgment or choice rather than simply following rules, and whether that choice was grounded in considerations of public policy. If the answer to both is yes, the government can avoid liability.

According to a 2024 Harvard Law Review article, opens new tab, when the United States invokes the exception in moving to dismiss a claim, it succeeds in terminating nearly 75% of claims.

Romanucci said he expects the government would argue that Ross’s use of deadly force falls under the provision.

But that may not be the end of the story. Romanucci said he also anticipates that if Good’s family opts to bring a lawsuit, they'll allege Ross violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by using deadly force.

That raises a pivotal question: Does the discretionary function exception shield conduct that is allegedly unconstitutional?

The federal appellate courts are split on the answer. Most – but not all – have held government officials “do not possess discretion to violate constitutional rights or federal statutes,” as the 4th Circuit put it in 2001, opens new tab. Notably, the 8th Circuit, which includes Minnesota, reached a similar conclusion in 2003, ruling, opens new tab that government activities that violate constitutional rights fall outside the discretionary-function exception.

But the 7th and 11th Circuits have rejected that view. The 11th Circuit wrote in 2021, opens new tab that it doesn’t matter “how poorly, abusively, or unconstitutionally” an employee acted — only whether the underlying decision was discretionary.

Should Good's case proceed, this circuit split could position it for U.S. Supreme Court review.

In the meantime, recent ICE settlements show how plaintiffs alleging constitutional violations have prevailed.

For example, in 2024 a federal judge in Manhattan allowed a suit to move forward by a woman from Ecuador, identified only as MQ, who allegedly fell while shackled by ICE in 2021, broke her ankle, and waited three months in detention before receiving treatment.

After an immigration judge granted her release on bail, she spoke critically to New York lawmakers and others about her experience. She claimed ICE retaliated by placing her back in detention, in violation of her First Amendment rights.

U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter Jr. ruled, opens new tab that the government cannot claim immunity from suit “when its officers engage in tortious conduct that violates the Constitution.” The government settled the case last year for $70,000, according to records in the Judgment Fund, opens new tab, which pays settlements and judgments against the United States.

ICE in court papers denied wrongdoing. MQ’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

Judgment Fund records show other ICE-related settlements. For example, a Pennsylvania family claimed, opens new tab their Fourth Amendment rights were violated during a 2020 predawn raid in which officers allegedly injured a man and caused emotional distress to his wife and children. ICE again denied wrongdoing; the case settled for $72,500.

In total, the United States paid $5.25 million to settle 138 lawsuits involving ICE in 2025, according to Judgment Fund records, though most of the claims stemmed from traffic accidents.

Whether Good’s family can overcome the government’s defenses remains to be seen. If they sue, the case may ultimately test not just one agent’s judgment but the limits of federal accountability.

Video footage shot by bystanders shows Pretti filming a group of US Border Patrol agents on Saturday before stepping in to defend a woman who was shoved to the ground by one agent.

In footage shared by US-based Drop Site news, Pretti can be seen trying to help the woman before at least five agents tackle him to the ground and shoot him multiple times after a scuffle on the icy road.

Analysis of footage by US media and Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, shows that Pretti’s gun had already been confiscated by an agent before he was shot dead.

Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara later told reporters that Pretti was a “lawful gun owner” with a permit, and that his only criminal history was a few traffic tickets.

Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security, claimed without evidence that Pretti was an “assassin” who tried to “murder federal agents”, while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said he had “violently” resisted arrest.

Popular right-wing influencers amplified the Trump administration’s claims on X.

The MAGA-allied account “Libs of TikTok” labelled Pretti a “lunatic” and an “assassin”.

Right-wing influencer Alexander Muse told his 681,000 followers that Pretti was “expecting a firefight at a distance” with federal agents despite there being no evidence that he ever took out or brandished his gun.

Some right-wing influencers went even further than echoing the Trump administration’s narrative, piling blatant misinformation on top of officials’ baseless accusations.

Trump ally Nick Sorter, who has 1.4 million followers on X, falsely claimed that Pretti, a US citizen, was an “illegal alien” who was “armed with a gun and attempted to PULL IT on agents as he was being apprehended”.

Conservative podcaster Jesse Kelly smeared Pretti as a “soldier for the communist revolution” who had “died fighting in a war” in an X post that included a photo of Pretti on a hike.

MAGA-affiliated accounts also shared digitally altered images purporting to be pictures of Pretti dressed in female clothing.

In a statement, Pretti’s parents said their son was a “kindhearted soul” and that the administration’s “sickening lies” about him were “reprehensible and disgusting”.

Claims that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” and scrutiny of his political beliefs mirror similar accusations levelled at Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was also fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Trump administration officials also described Good as a “terrorist” and claimed that she was trying to run over an immigration officer with her vehicle despite video evidence casting doubt on those claims.

Officials have also spread misleading information seemingly aimed at discrediting protests against Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown more generally.

The White House last week shared an image of an arrested activist, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that had been altered with artificial intelligence to make her look emotionally distressed.

Some Republicans have pushed back on the narrative pushed around Pretti’s death, including Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, who said on X that “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right”.

The National Rifle Association, a pro-gun lobby group, also rejected a suggestion by a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor that approaching a law enforcement officer with a gun could be grounds for being shot.

Minnesota law enforcement officials have also contested statements by Trump administration officials, including a claim by Vice President JD Vance that local authorities refused to assist their federal counterparts in the investigation into Pretti’s killing.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said on Sunday that it was state authorities who were being obstructed, stating on X that its officers had been denied access to the crime scene by the DHS.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-25T160905Z_743706685_RC2F8JAZMFGZ_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1769403654.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-26 11:00:25.705131

Several constitutional law professors struggled to find a historic example of local officials being investigated over allegations of interfering with federal law enforcement.","Several legal experts say they haven’t seen any evidence to support the allegation that several Minnesota officials obstructed recent federal immigration enforcement as members of the Trump administration have suggested.

Federal prosecutors last week delivered subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and other officials, as the Justice Department seeks records for violations of unspecified federal laws during the intense immigration enforcement crackdown in the state.

The subpoenas are related to whether the state and local officials hindered the federal enforcement through public statements they’ve made, according to the Associated Press, which reported the investigation is focused on the potential violation of a conspiracy statute.

Minnesota officials have characterized the subpoenas as “political theater,” intimidation tactics and an attack on their First Amendment rights.

“Going on TV and saying ICE is violating constitutional rights of citizens and noncitizens, that is not impeding federal immigration,” said Jill Hasday, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Law School. “That is exercising First Amendment freedoms.

“I haven’t seen any evidence where they are actually impeding federal immigration enforcement.”

Hasday called the Justice Department’s probe of local officials “highly unusual,” a sentiment echoed by several constitutional law experts who spoke with the Minnesota Star Tribune.

The experts said comments made publicly by Democrats Walz and Frey, including fierce condemnations of the ICE crackdown and calls for residents to record activity and peacefully demonstrate, are constitutionally protected. (This story was reported before remarks made Saturday, Jan. 24, when Alex Pretti was fatally shot by an agent or agents with U.S. Border Patrol.)

Many Republicans have criticized the Minnesota officials for those statements, although after Pretti’s killing, President Donald Trump went further, accusing Walz and Frey of “inciting Insurrection” in a social media post that cited “their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”

The Justice Department has not elaborated on its investigation to the Star Tribune. But the content of the subpoenas — legal orders to testify or produce documents related to a potential investigation — offer clearer insight into what federal prosecutors are seeking.

The subpoena issued to Frey’s office, which it shared, requires testimony before a grand jury on Feb. 3. It also requires the office to produce records, including documents related to the city’s cooperation with or refusal to aid immigration enforcement, refusal to comply with detainers and hindering, doxing, or surveilling immigration officers.

“Issuing subpoenas is an aggressive move,” Hasday said.

In 2018, she said, the Trump administration threatened to subpoena local officials over sanctuary city policies, making similar arguments about interfering with federal authorities. It ultimately did not carry through with the threat.

The Justice Department has filed civil lawsuits against several states and cities with sanctuary policies, alleging an obstruction of federal immigration law enforcement. In July, a federal judge dismissed such a lawsuit in Illinois. But the latest action shows an escalated approach as the department pursues a criminal investigation.

Peter Larsen, an assistant professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said such subpoenas “tend to be pretty exploratory in nature.”

“Grand jury processes themselves are very deferential, so to get a subpoena for this, you don’t have to prove that a crime occurred,” he said. “You don’t even have to really show good cause that a crime occurred.

“You only really need to show that you’re seeking materials that are relevant to a possible investigation.”

Ultimately, grand juries can decide to recommend charges or not.

The subpoena issued to Frey’s office also asks for emails, text messages, voice recordings and other communication related to federal immigration enforcement.

Federal prosecutors are likely casting a “wide net,” said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush.

“They’re looking for the needle in the haystack,” said Painter, an outspoken critic of Trump. “They’re probably trying to look for some hothead who said something really stupid.

“They’re going to go through thousands of emails to find something. I’d be extremely surprised if they found anything that would be grounds for any type of serious criminal investigation.”

However, he said, “Could they find something potentially embarrassing? Yes.”

Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official, said the subpoena of Frey’s office suggests the government is “criminally investigating state and local officials for doing what they’re entitled do to, which is not voluntarily cooperate with ICE or DHS, and instead do just what is required by law.”

Not cooperating with ICE beyond what is required by law would not amount to impeding federal immigration enforcement, she said.

McCord is also the executive director of the nonpartisan Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown, which has brought litigation against the Trump administration.

“Impeding would have to be something more than that. Impeding would require some sort of force,” she said. “I have not seen even a suggestion that these officials have engaged in force or even incited others to engage in force. They’ve been telling people to be peaceful.”

Federal subpoenas of local officials or their offices usually stem from corruption scandals, misappropriated federal funds or criminal activities, University of Minnesota Law School professor Myron Orfield said — not policy disagreement.

Several constitutional law professors struggled to find a historic example of local officials being investigated over allegations of interfering with federal law enforcement.

Orfield said the closest example he can think of is the massive resistance by several Southern governors to federal court-ordered integration during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s.

“Many governors opposed federal court orders on integration and used very strong language, called the federal government communists and everything you can think of,” Orfield said. “And they were never investigated” for their political views or statements.

Another example, Larsen said, is when the government brought charges against several members of the Ku Klux Klan and local law enforcement in the killings of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964.

The suspects were charged with conspiring to deprive the three men of their civil rights (loosely, the basis of the movie “Mississippi Burning.”) At the time, the state declined to press murder charges.

“That’s the comparator we have, really. We really don’t see this happening in other times and places,” Larsen said.

At the same time, he said, this is different.

“We’re talking about criminal obstruction,” he said. “With criminal obstruction, typically that’s a much higher bar and we don’t see that in modern history.”

Ultimately, Larsen said, a grand jury could recommend issuing charges, or it could reject the prosecutors’ argument and decline charges. Such was the case in December when a grand jury declined to federally indict New York Attorney General Leticia James.

“A lot of investigations that do come before grand juries tend to end quietly and tend to end without charges,” Larsen said. “Also if the (Justice Department) did ultimately bring charges, this would be a pretty novel application, it’s a break from historical practice, and it’s a major escalation in this federal-state conflict.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/RB5KHq6eaUSaCX2wtltfMQqKy5k=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2026/01/25/69769a1e0158c.hires.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 08:57:58.968441

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security earlier this month, accusing the feds of usurping the state’s right to police itself and putting an undue burden on local officials.

RELATED: Minnesota AG, Twin Cities mayors sue DHS to end ‘federal invasion’

Local officials are hoping the lawsuit will get a judge to put an immediate stop to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations across the state.

Ellison over the weekend called ICE’s surge a “novel abuse of the Constitution.”

RELATED: DOJ: Minnesota lawsuit seeking to stop ICE surge is ‘legally frivolous,’ politically motivated

Federal officials dispute that, claiming the state’s lawsuit is “legally frivolous” and based only on political motivations rather than legal basis.

A federal judge could issue a preliminary ruling as early as Monday morning.

Then, on Monday afternoon, a hearing is set for a joint lawsuit from the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that seeks to force federal agents to maintain any evidence related to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.

A judge granted a temporary restraining order Saturday night, telling federal officials to preserve all evidence.

This challenge comes after Homeland Security officials again prevented state investigators from inspecting the scene where Pretti was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday. The BCA was out Sunday inspecting the scene and is trying to conduct its own investigation. However, state leaders say there still isn’t cooperation from their federal counterparts.

While administration officials claimed that Pretti “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun,” video of the incident showed Pretti was holding a phone. The officers were in Minneapolis as part of a large-scale crackdown by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

As Pretti was attempting to assist another person who had been pepper-sprayed in the face, a group of federal officers pushed him to the ground, beat him, and shot him multiple times at close range. Pretti was licensed to carry a gun, but there is no indication that he was ever holding a weapon, much less threatening the officers.

Pretti’s death was the latest in a string of horrific, violent, and fatal incidents by federal officers participating in ICE’s Minneapolis operation.

Hours after Pretti was killed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was in Washington, DC, visiting the White House for a screening of Melania, a documentary produced by First Lady Melania Trump. As Jassy and other guests entered, a military band played “Melania’s Waltz,” a song composed for the film. Guests received “glossy, commemorative black and white popcorn boxes for guests, served by gloved waiters.”

Amazon paid $59 million for the rights to the vanity project, most of which went to Melania Trump herself. According to Matt Belloni, Amazon is paying another $35 million to promote the film. Despite the massive budget, Amazon “has not shared the film with critics, and won’t before its release.”

Although Melania will almost certainly lose tens of millions of dollars for Amazon, it is a small price to pay to stay in the good graces of President Donald Trump and his administration. Amazon has billions in government contracts and provides much of the technological backbone for ICE’s surveillance and deportation activities.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts the database, known as Investigative Case Management (ICM), that ICE uses to target and deport immigrants. ICM, which was created by Palantir, “integrates a vast ecosystem of public and private data to track down immigrants and, in many cases, deport them.” The data includes “a person’s immigration history, family relationships, personal connections, addresses, phone records, biometric traits, and other information.” Through Palantir, AWS receives millions of dollars annually from the federal government to host ICM.

Last April, the Trump administration awarded Palantir a new $30 million contract to create “ImmigrationOS,” which is “a new tool to provide [ICE] with enhanced capabilities to support deportation efforts.” ImmigrationOS is likely hosted on AWS, which has a strategic partnership with Palantir.

AWS also hosts a massive surveillance system for ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The $6 billion system, known as Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART), is designed to hold “personal and biometric data on over 270 million people, including 6.7 million iris scans and 1.1 billion face images.”

In a 2022 letter to Amazon, advocates argued that by “hosting DHSʼ HART database, AWS is directly facilitating the creation of an invasive biometrics database that will supercharge surveillance and deportation, risking human rights violations.” They urged Amazon to stop powering the HART database, which is still in development, but the company did not respond.

When Amazon employees urged then-CEO Jeff Bezos to terminate its relationship with ICE in 2018, Bezos defended the practice. “There aren’t other countries where everybody is trying to get in,” Bezos told WIRED. “I’d let them in if it were me. I like ‘em, I want all of them in. But this is a great country and it does need to be defended.”

On its corporate webpage, Amazon says it “support[s] our refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant population because we recognize the challenges they face in the U.S.” This is the same population being targeted in Minneapolis.

In November 2025, Amazon announced it was investing $50 billion to build out its cloud and AI services for the federal government. ICE and related agencies are in a position to provide Amazon with a return on its investment. Trump’s megabill, enacted last year, “allocated more than $170 billion over four years for border and interior enforcement.”

Amazon, which did not respond to a request for comment, is one of several consumer-facing brands with deep financial connections to ICE.

Citizens Bank

Since Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the population of migrants held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has exploded — from below 40,000 in January 2025 to over 73,000 today. This has created a massive demand for private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic, to build new facilities.

Numerous financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, SunTrust, BNP Paribas, and Fifth Third Bancorp, pledged in 2019 to stop working with the private prison industry. (Bank of America and SunTrust have since “softened their policy statements to allow financing again for detention companies in some circumstances.”)

But Citizens Financial Group, which operates Citizens Bank, has continued to provide financing for private prison construction. In July 2025, Citizens provided a $450 million revolving credit line to GEO Group. Earlier, in March 2025, Citizens underwrote $500 million in bonds for CoreCivic.

On its website, Citizens says it is “committed to strengthening communities“ and works “to advance social equity.” The company did not respond to a request for comment.

AT&T

In September 2024, AT&T inked a 10-year, $147 million contract with ICE’s parent agency, DHS, to “provide mission-critical communications services.” The agreement provides ICE and other DHS subdivisions with “end-to-end voice priority over the AT&T commercial wireless network.” In August, the Trump administration awarded AT&T an $11 million no-bid contract to provide ICE with “data analytics and support services.”

AT&T pitched FirstNet, its specialized network for first responders, to the federal government, touting its ability to use “photographs, real-time audio/video feeds, and databases from other state, local, or Federal agencies… to aid in the identification… of undocumented immigrants.”

AT&T’s Human Rights Policy, last updated in August 2025, says the company seeks “to ensure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses.” It also stresses that “all people, regardless of status or circumstance, deserve the dignity and freedom of human rights protections.”

Last November, activists in Chicago accused AT&T of “lin[ing] its pockets with public dollars” from ICE, “whose agents are masked, unidentifiable, and operating without warrants as they terrorize members of the public.”

AT&T did not respond to a request for comment.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Jp!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74a02b0a-4386-43e4-9515-924ad9338051_1024x793.jpeg",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:30.450605

The US president told the Wall Street Journal in a short interview that immigration enforcement officers would leave the Minneapolis area “at some point”.

The publication said Trump did not directly answer when asked twice whether the officer who shot Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, had done the right thing. Pressed further, he said: “We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.”

It said Trump criticised Pretti for carrying a gun during protest activity, quoting the president as saying: “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”

Trump signalled a willingness to eventually withdraw immigration enforcement officials from the Minneapolis area, saying: “At some point we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done a phenomenal job.”

A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after Pretti’s fatal shooting – a sign that the Trump administration’s accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.

The Republican chair of the House homeland security committee, Andrew Garbarino, has sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection and US Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe”, according to the Associated Press.

Other congressional Republicans have pressed for more information, including the Texas representative Michael McCaul and the senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflects a party struggling with how to respond to federal agents’ killing of Pretti.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) almost immediately alleged Pretti had “violently resisted” officers, saying they fired “defensive shots”. Video evidence contradicts that account. Trump also shared an image of the pistol allegedly found on Pretti in a Truth Social post, writing: “This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!) and ready to go.”

Pretti was reportedly legally permitted to carry a gun. Widely circulated video of his shooting death does not appear to depict him holding a gun; it does show an officer reaching to Pretti’s lower back and stepping away with what appeared to be a pistol – and Pretti being subsequently shot to death.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest pro-gun group, also responded after Bill Essayli – who was appointed by Trump to temporarily serve as a US attorney in California in 2025 – posted on social media: “If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.”

The NRA posted: “This sentiment … is dangerous and wrong. Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former House Republican from Georgia, posted in support of law enforcement, but defended the right to legally carry firearms. “I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement. However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment,” Greene wrote. “Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.

She added: “I support American’s 1st and 4th amendment rights. There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing.”

Democrats have vowed to withhold further funding from DHS unless a bill soon to come before the Senate is amended to include reforms that would restrict federal agents’ actions in their deportation surge.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said Democrats would not provide the necessary votes if DHS funding remained in the measure. A spokesperson for the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said DHS and other government funds would be voted on as a single package. Without a compromise, the government faces a partial shutdown at the end of January.

The big picture: While administration officials stayed on message and backed the federal agents in Minnesota, the criticisms show Republican cracks over Trump's increasingly unpopular immigration agenda.

What they're saying: One of the most high profile warnings came from Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) who signaled to the administration — albeit gently — that federal agents should leave Minneapolis.

""If I were President Trump I would almost think about ... if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harms way and there's a chance of losing more innocent lives ... then maybe go to another city,"" he said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Comer predicted Minnesotans would ""rebel against their leadership"" while he still blamed state officials.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is overseeing a precarious appropriations process as immigration enforcement surges in her state, said in a statement to Axios that the shooting ""needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.""

She added, ""I urge protestors to keep space between themselves and law enforcement and not to interfere with operations.""

Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) called the situation ""horrifying"" in a Sunday statement and called for a ""prioritized, transparent investigation."" He also said his support for funding ICE has not changed.

Zoom out: Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), head of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Saturday requested testimony from officials leading ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

However, his letters did not directly mention Saturday's shooting.

Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.) applauded the requests, saying he was ""disturbed"" by the video out of Minnesota and stressing the importance of transparency in immigration enforcement operations.

Yes, but: Many of the Republicans who spoke out, including Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), are retiring or have frequently broken with Trump.

They implored federal agents to cooperate with local law enforcement and avoid a rush to judgment.

""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,"" wrote Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). ""The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

The other side: White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson praised the ""heroic"" immigration officers for capturing criminals ""despite violent resistance and dangerous, untrue smears against them.""

Catch up quick: After federal officials shot Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security claimed he had approached the officers with a gun and appeared to want to ""massacre law enforcement.""

Top officials were also quick to label Pretti a domestic terrorist.

However, footage from the scene shows Pretti filming the officers with a camera before he was sprayed with chemical agents and wrestled to the ground. Afterwards several shots ring out.

Local officials have said Pretti lawfully possessed his weapon.

Friction point: Democrats are already demanding Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment, and the handling of Pretti's death threatens the administration's credibility even among allies, Axios' Marc Caputo reports.

Notably, the incident put feds on a collision course with second amendment advocacy groups, typically friendlier to a gun-rights-focused GOP.

Prominent voices in the splintered MAGA media landscape and broader conservative media criticized administration officials' rhetoric after the shooting, on the concealed-carry issue and beyond.

Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.","As federal immigration enforcement activity increases in Democratic-led states across the country, immigrant advocates and civil rights groups are warning that Virginia — which recently flipped full control of state government to Democrats — could be next.

Gov. Abigail Spanberger, sworn in earlier this month as Virginia’s 75th governor, has moved quickly to draw a line between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, while acknowledging that much of the authority still rests outside her control.

Just hours after taking the oath of office on Jan. 17, Spanberger fulfilled a promise she made in an August interview with The Mercury, rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47.

The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.

Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.

“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week.

She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”

“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities.

“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”

On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.

About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.

“We’re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,” said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.

State action, limited reach

While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.

All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new Legal Aid Justice Center analysis found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.

The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.

The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.

“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation.

“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”

LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.

According to ICE’s own website, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.

Fear, trust and public safety

Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.

“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.

“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”

The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.

“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.

Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety

Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.

Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.

“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”

House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, also warned that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime.

“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. “When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”

However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.

According to ICE’s own figures, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses.

In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were “violent criminals,” but Miyares at the time declined to provide evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury.

Local leaders respond

In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in Chesterfield County and Petersburg.

“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”

Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.

“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.

“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”

Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials confirmed receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.

County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.

Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.

Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.

A broader political test

The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.

In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent fatally shot a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, Walz demanded that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident.

Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.

Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law.

In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor caught between immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey under pressure to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control.

Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.

“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.

Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.","On January 12, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address a deepening circuit split about the process for certifying collective class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA"") and the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""). As a result, uncertainty persists for employers and employees alike, with federal courts adopting a range of standards.

Historical Class Certification Standard

Both Rule 23 class actions and FLSA section 216(b) collective actions allow employees to bring suit on behalf of others who are ""similarly situated."" Section 216(b) mandates employee-plaintiffs opt-in to the lawsuit, which requires courts to approve and oversee the circulation of class notice to potential plaintiffs. The same process applies to ADEA class actions. In Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court authorized the sending of notice of a FLSA collective action to potential opt-in plaintiffs so long as that notice is neutral, timely and accurate. Following the Supreme Court's holding in Hoffman-La Roche, most federal courts adopted a plaintiff-friendly, two-step analysis articulated in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. Under the Lusardi approach, plaintiffs who demonstrate that employees are ""similarly situated"" based on a ""modest factual showing"" achieve conditional certification.

Conditional certification permits district courts to oversee the circulation of notice to potential class action members. Courts then consider final certification or decertification at a later point in the case. Practically, this lenient standard has increased class sizes and created pressure for employers to settle early, before incurring the time and expense associated with the seemingly perfunctory ""conditional"" certification process and, thereafter, the final, evidence-based class certification decision.

Seventh Circuit's Approach

In August, the Seventh Circuit, in Richards v. Eli Lilly & Company, departed from the two-step Lusardi analysis. There, the Seventh Circuit held that district courts must consider evidence from both sides concerning whether workers are similarly situated enough to proceed together. Under the Seventh Circuit's approach in Richards, a plaintiff must first make a threshold showing that there is a material factual dispute as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. Thereafter, employer/defendants may submit rebuttal evidence. Once the court determines a material dispute exists, the decision to issue notice rests on its assessment of the factual dispute before it. Overall, this standard requires more evidence than Lusardi, which can reduce the pressure employers feel to settle that has traditionally accompanied conditional certification.

Fifth and Sixth Circuit Approach

Like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have moved away from the traditional Lusardi standard.

In the Fifth Circuit (Swales v. KLLM Transport Services LLC), plaintiffs must meet a more demanding one-step test, showing it is ""more likely than not"" that employees are similarly situated. When crafting this standard in Swales, the Fifth Circuit noted the more lenient Lusardi approach resulted in broad circulation of conditional class notice to plaintiffs who were not truly similarly situated. This was frequently used as leverage against employers to compel them to settle. Similar to the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit now requires lower courts to vet plaintiffs at the outset of litigation and consider all available evidence before authorizing class notices. This standard is far more favorable to employer/defendants.

In the Sixth Circuit (Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC), plaintiffs must demonstrate a ""strong likelihood"" that the proposed group is similarly situated. The Sixth Circuit rejected the ""more likely than not"" standard as too high of a bar for plaintiffs, but found the Lusardi approach too lenient. Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff must make a showing that goes beyond creating a genuine issue of fact, but it need not rise to the level of ""more likely than not"" or a ""preponderance"". Accordingly, the standard of proof in the Sixth Circuit falls between Lusardi and Swales.

The Supreme Court Denies Certiorari in Richards

In Richards, Eli Lilly submitted a petition for certiorari—which was joined by several amici—arguing that it was critical the Supreme Court resolve the growing circuit split in class certification standards. Last week, however, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Richards will now head back to the district court, which will likely apply the new Seventh Circuit standard to determine class certification.

What Employers Need to Know

The Supreme Court's refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions. While most federal courts continue to apply the Lusardi approach—a relatively low bar for plaintiffs to obtain condition certification—recent decisions in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have created stricter, more employer-friendly standards. These varying criteria will almost certainly have the strategic effect of encouraging collective action plaintiffs to file suit—if jurisdictionally possible—in circuits other than the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh. Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.

The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts.
Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.","The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.

By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department.

As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.”

Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.

Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists.

A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out.

In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.

“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Pretti’s body.

“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”

“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.

The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.

Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.

A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.

On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.

“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.

Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.

Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.

“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.

Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him.

“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote.

Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began.

Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms. On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.

“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.

False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement.

The surge of federal force to Minneapolis is testing long-held understandings of constitutional rights and the restraint, humanity and accountability owed to the governed by those who govern them in a democratic society.

By insisting that details of two killings that millions of Americans saw on cellphone videos did not take place, senior administration officials are fracturing reality and implying that their brazen power can be wielded with impunity.

And by prejudging and distorting the tragedy in its immediate aftermath, the officials have prejudiced an investigation they will conduct into one of the gravest events that can happen in a republic: government law enforcement killing a citizen.

A moment of national reckoning is building over the principles embedded in America’s moral and legal foundations — which will be extolled this year in celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

Alex Pretti’s shooting also has more prosaic political implications. It’s the latest incident that raises questions over whether Trump, with his diminished approval ratings on most issues, has lost the public only a year into his second term. The administration’s unrepentant response is also another sign that it may be prepared to defy political fallout — even in a midterm election year — in its race to irrevocably change the US and the world.

Every sign Sunday was that the White House will not back down. But CNN reported on disquiet among Department of Homeland Security officials at the aggressive and polarizing approach of Secretary Kristi Noem. The former South Dakota governor could be vulnerable should Trump seek a new course.

Saturday’s tragedy also presented Democrats with a new dilemma on balancing fierce demands from base voters to try to thwart Trump’s strongman rule while having only limited power in Washington. The party hopes to keep attention on the president’s biggest current liability — his denial of an affordability crisis hampering working families.

In the past, Democrats have stumbled when Trump has lashed them as weak on crime and immigration and hostile to law enforcement. But the political heat is so intense that some Democratic senators are vowing to block a DHS funding bill, which could spark a partial government shutdown at the week’s end.

A tragedy that went national in a moment

The death of Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse and US citizen, on Saturday quickly flashed up in horrific, graphic detail on millions of cellphones. Once again, less than three weeks after the shooting death of Renee Good, outside federal forces gunned down a Minnesotan and deepened a national political and societal crisis.

Trump’s second term has been exhausting as the rush of events and recrimination shreds perspective about any single shock. While it’s difficult to assess the lasting significance of events in real time, there’s a growing sense that Minnesota could represent a definitional moment.

“What we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.”

The administration complains that Democratic local officials are not cooperating with 3,000 federal agents sent to Minnesota ostensibly to deport undocumented migrants with criminal records. It says that protesters who document agents’ activity are endangering them and breaking the law. Officials’ claims that “agitators” have joined protests may also contain some truth.

Trump on Sunday issued a series of demands on Minnesota officials and put the blame for the deaths of Pretti and Good not on aggressive federal agents, but rather on Democrats. He wrote on Truth Social the party was “putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved. Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos.”

White House officials correctly state that one reason Trump was elected for a second term in 2024 was that Americans despaired at former President Joe Biden’s failure to secure the southern border. Some Republicans regard rhetoric from Democratic leaders such as Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey as inflammatory, playing to a liberal gallery and sure to spike dangerous tensions.

But there’s no evidence voters signed up for groups of armed and masked agents roaming city streets in SUVs or for sudden escalations that have left two citizens dead. Or that they think the constitutional right to protest should be abridged by an administration that seems to have chosen a Democratic state for a power play.

Americans have also not signed off on the apparent new erosions of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search as directed in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo last week. Federal agents who have refused local law enforcement access to the scenes of shootings and administration officials who have shut down independent investigations of the deaths are also raising questions about legal safeguards over state power.

One critical political question in the coming days will be whether even those Americans who backed Trump’s hardline promises on border security will reject his imposition of ruthless federal power in deportations. It is possible that shocking incidents like Saturday’s — or the heartrending photos of the detention of a 5-year-old preschooler in Minnesota last week — will further erode his political foundation.

“President Trump closed the border, promised to get violent criminals out of our country,” Stitt told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“I think everybody agrees with that,” Stitt went on. “But now Americans are asking themselves, ‘What is the endgame? What is the solution?’ We believe in federalism and state rights. And nobody likes feds coming into their state.”

‘A wake-up call’

This specter of federal power descending from out of state — in a way that seems antithetical to America’s republican DNA — is concentrating many minds and raising the possibility that Minnesota’s plight could become a galvanizing force nationally.

A sense of a coming national moment of decision was reinforced by detailed written statements by two Democratic former presidents. In a statement Sunday, Bill Clinton said, “Over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decision we make and the actions we take shape our history for years to come. This is one of them.” The 42nd president added: “It’s up to all of us who believe in the promise of American democracy to stand up, speak out and show that our nation still belongs to We the People.”

Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote Sunday that the killing of Pretti is “a heartbreaking tragedy. It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”

Trump’s base — which rallied to his tough immigration rhetoric in 2016 — would argue that lax border enforcement also infringed those values.

But the crackdown has become about more than immigration. Like the Pentagon’s killings of alleged drug traffickers in the Pacific and Caribbean and Trump’s bid to extort Greenland from Denmark, it’s a manifestation of a White House that increasingly embraces rogue tactics and spurns due process in the interest of demonstrating its own power.

Administration reaction to Pretti’s killing recalled the character assassination, victim-blaming and distortions of the aftermath of Good’s death. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a “would be assassin” on X. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino said the deceased man showed up to “massacre” federal agents. And Noem suggested that federal agents fired defensively at Pretti while fearing for their lives because he was armed.

In a charged political moment, it is nevertheless objectively true that these depictions are not supported on cellphone footage seen by millions of Americans. These instant artifacts of a new age when everything unfolds on social videos suggest federal agents escalated the situation with Pretti, who was filming their activity; forced him to the ground; and then fired multiple shots at him at point-blank range, apparently after he was disarmed.

On Sunday, officials continued to try to deny the visual record. “The victims are the Border Patrol agents,” Bovino told CNN’s Bash. He added, “The suspect put himself in that situation,” using a questionable description of Pretti, who did not appear to commit any crime.

Noem said, “We can’t have individuals that are impeding law enforcement operations and then showing up with guns and weapons and no ID and confronting law enforcement.” FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that “you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions.”

There is no evidence so far that Pretti, who had a permit to carry the gun and was not shown on any video brandishing a weapon, was doing anything other than exercising his First and Second Amendment rights.

In emotive confrontations between law enforcement and citizens, there’s always the possibility that not every angle or dimension is captured on camera. This is why investigations are so important in killings involving agents and officers. But Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday that federal officials denied access to the scene of the Pretti’s killing to the state investigative agency that probes law enforcement shootings.

Top officials including Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche promised an investigation. But it’s set to be conducted by the DHS with the help of the FBI. So, as in the case of Good’s death, the government officials who have already prejudged the killings and denied visual evidence will oversee the findings. There can be little public confidence that they will not be politically tainted.

‘Not what’s happening’

Outsiders cannot say what was in the mind of the officers involved with Pretti. But the impunity immediately offered to those who killed Good seems unlikely to have introduced any sense of restraint among their colleagues. Logic suggests the administration’s direct support for these aggressive ICE and Border Patrol tactics only makes future tragedies more likely.

The open denial of events that millions of Americans can see unfold on video, meanwhile, seems to go beyond normal hardball politics. It’s beginning to look like a president who believes he enjoys unchecked power wanting to demonstrate he can reinvent the reality of a nation he leads.

“It should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily, will lie to your face, when you can see the evidence for yourself,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on “State of the Union.” “The fact of the matter is, Minneapolis is fundamentally less safe because ICE and CBP are there.”

Murphy also argued that the violent confrontations between Minnesotans and federal officers were a feature rather than an unwanted byproduct of Trump’s policies. “They are there to cause a conflict. They are there to create mayhem. And it isn’t going to be just isolated to Minneapolis,” he said.

The question now is whether Trump’s political underpinnings will break before his method of framing alternate narratives — with the help of a compliant conservative media machine.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2257495092.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:39.526231

A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.

“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Rosen said Noem’s conduct is “deeply shameful” and she “must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”

Impeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.

And while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.

Noem defends fatal shooting

The senator’s call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.

During the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.

Noem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”

“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.

In her call for Noem’s impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.

Senate anger over ICE violence

Rosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”

And while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem’s impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.

Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”

As administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

House Democrats increasingly back Noem’s impeachment

Calls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.

Most of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem’s impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.

New York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”

“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.

Protests continued in Minneapolis and other US cities on Sunday over the fatal shooting by immigration agents of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said America was at an ""inflection point"" and repeated calls for US President Donald Trump to remove federal immigration agents from the city.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot on Saturday because he was ""brandishing"" a gun. Local authorities deny this, adding that the gun was legally registered and that he was shot after the gun was removed.

Trump has signalled that he might be willing to eventually withdraw ICE agents from the Minneapolis area but has not given a time frame.

""At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job,"" he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Sunday.

Multiple vigils were held for Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend. He is the second person to be fatally shot in the city during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown this month.

Lifelong resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those who gathered on Sunday afternoon to pay her respects and protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

""I'm tired of protesting,"" she told the BBC. ""We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?""

Demonstrators of all ages were chanting ""No more Minnesota nice - Minneapolis on strike"" and ""ICE out now"" before they began moving through the city streets.

""This is not the America I fought for,"" said one man the BBC spoke to, who asked not to be named.

Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The chief executives of more than 60 Minnesota-based businesses, including 3M, Best Buy and Target have also signed an open letter calling for ""an immediate de-escalation of tensions"" and for local and federal officials ""to work together to find real solutions"".

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told the BBC that state officers were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's shooting by federal agents, despite securing a search warrant.

He added that all levels of law enforcement in Minnesota have been working with federal law enforcement ""for several years"", and that the unfolding situation in Minnesota was hampering agencies' ability to continue such investigations.

Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.

The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety effort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. It has also described Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist"".

Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.

Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment, saying: ""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting"".

They added that he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to Associated Press (AP), court records show he had no criminal record.

""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,"" his family said in the statement.

On Sunday, Tim Walz said: ""I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America.

""If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.""

Backlash against the Trump administration's crackdown is growing, including from within the Republican party.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt told CNN that people were watching fellow Americans being shot on television and that ""federal tactics and accountability"" had become a growing concern for voters.

Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said the Minneapolis shooting was ""incredibly disturbing"" and ""the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

Democrats have responded by threatening to block a key government financing package if it contains funds for the Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, raising the prospect of another government shutdown.

Former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both criticised the situation in Minneapolis, with the former described events in Minneapolis as ""horrible scenes"" that ""I never thought would take place in America.""

Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally.

Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as ""EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States"" must ""formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence"".

He also called on US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of ""all these problems"".

The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities.

Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging ""left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations"".

Federal agents shot and killed Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, and videos have since emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and Pretti just before the shooting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.

O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a ""full investigation"" into the killing of Pretti.

In a statement, it said: ""Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens.""

US Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were looking for a man named Jose Huerta Chuma during a ""targeted"" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanour-level traffic offences from more than a decade ago.

The latest shooting follows weeks of tensions between the Minnesota authorities, federal agents and protesters who have taken to the streets to observe the agents during their anti-immigration raids.

Earlier this month, an ICE agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation.

In a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, Good's family law firm Romanucci & Blandin urged all Americans to ""trust their own eyes as they interpret the horrific video"" of Pretti's shooting.

Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers.
Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025.
The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024.
“So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.

“I would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,” Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.

A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China’s Xinjiang region.

The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.

Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said “there was no help from the outside world” and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.

He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.

“We are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,” said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.”

Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.

“This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,” she said in a written response to a request for comment. “All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.”

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan’s case, the Illinois Democrat called for “careful adherence to due process and America’s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.”

Immigrants can apply for asylum when there’s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.

Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That’s about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.

The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked “abandoned” when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group’s chief operating officer. He said it’s not yet clear what caused the rise.

In cities across the country, some immigrants have stopped showing up for routine hearings after agents began making arrests right in the courtrooms, turning them into deportation traps.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.

The Chinese government has denied the allegations, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Beijing tolerates little dissent, especially on issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Communist Party rule, and has largely silenced dissent through a range of coercive means, including detention and “forced disappearances.”

Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said he was unfamiliar with the specifics of Guan’s case but defended China’s policy toward Xinjiang.

“The Chinese government has consistently worked to promote and protect human rights, and the development and progress in Xinjiang are plain to see and should not be smeared,” Liu said in a statement.

With the footage in hand, Guan knew he had to leave the country if he was to publish it. He went first to Hong Kong without a further plan. “I played it by ear,” he said.

From Hong Kong, he flew to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could then travel without a visa, and then on to the Bahamas before sailing to Florida in October 2021. By the time he arrived, he had released most of his video footage on YouTube.

Guan settled in Queens, a borough in New York City, and said he tried to live a “stable” life. Once he had a work permit, he worked as an Uber driver and did deliveries. He cut off contact with nearly all of his relatives back in China so they would not be harassed by the police.

He said he cherished the freedom from fear he enjoyed in the U.S. Then Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched his mass deportation campaign.

Guan said he understands why Trump has taken such a radical approach.

“It’s because the past immigration policy was too lax and caused resentment from many people,” Guan said, adding that he considers such fluctuations to be “normal” in a democratic society.

“No matter what it is, any issue gets both support and opposition,” he said. “I also have come to know that people in all parts of the country are protesting the government’s too aggressive behavior.”

Local residents who don’t know him personally have shown their support, Guan said. “So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said. “At the same time, I’ve felt the warmth of the U.S. society.”

Should he be released, he said he would cherish the opportunity to stay in the United States.

“I would like to do meaningful things,” Guan said. “I hope to establish some connections with others so that I can help others.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mariettatimes.com/images/2026/01/24141315/AP-US-China-Detainee-750x500.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 05:58:47.570915

I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents.
The federal agents, Bovino added, “prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement.
Was he simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road, and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement?
“We heard the law enforcement officer say gun, gun, gun.","Bovino replied, “The victim? The victims are the Border Patrol agents. I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation.”

Bovino said that Pretti had “injected” himself into a federal law enforcement operation and was “more than likely” on the scene to assault officers.

The federal agents, Bovino added, “prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement. So good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that.”

Pretti was shot and killed Saturday morning as CBP agents continued to patrol Minneapolis streets as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. He is the second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis to be killed by immigration officers in recent weeks. Renee Good was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month in the city.

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have questioned why Pretti was in an area where agents were on the scene to arrest a “violent” illegal immigrant and accused him of interfering with federal law enforcement operations.

“Let’s look at why he was there in the first place. Was he simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road, and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement? Or was he there for a reason?” Bovino said on Sunday.

Video footage of the moments leading up to the shooting and verified by several media outlets, including the New York Times, shows Pretti filming the scene with his phone. While federal officials assert Pretti was holding a gun, video of the incident does not appear to corroborate the allegations. The analysis from the New York Times concludes that agents did not identify Pretti had a gun until about eight seconds after they had wrestled him to the ground.

While Pretti did hold a concealed carry license, video footage of the shooting from multiple angles appears to show Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as he approaches a woman who had been shoved to the ground by agents.

“Are you saying it’s not okay for him to exercise his Second Amendment right, not to mention his First Amendment right to be there in the first place, and if you do you can be shot by federal law enforcement?” Bash asked.

“No, I didn’t say that, Dana. I never said that,” Bovino replied. “What I’m saying is we respect that Second Amendment right. But those rights don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers.”

Bovino added he does not know if Pretti was unarmed at the time of the incident but said that agents believed he was in possession of one. “We heard the law enforcement officer say gun, gun, gun. So at some point they knew there was a gun,” he said.

Video footage does not appear to show Pretti holding a gun as he tried to help the woman stand. Still, agents surround Pretti and force him to the ground before opening fire.

Bovino said he doesn’t know how many agents opened fire, but that those involved “will more than likely be on administrative duty” and relocated out of Minneapolis.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F17%2Ff3%2Fe0c114bc42cfa18851c17eb05747%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-61236.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 00:58:01.283994

Most recently, with federal immigration enforcement, agents have been in plain clothes with brown or black vests.
Should you be arrested or somebody you know be detained by immigration agents, have an emergency plan in place.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are continuing to crack down on undocumented citizens across the United States, including large-scale operations in Chicago, Charlotte, Minneapolis and Portland. Most recently, federal agents shot and killed a Minneapolis woman witnessing an immigration detainment. Agents also shot and injured a man in Portland.

The escalating protests have led to a need to know your legal rights, such as when attending a protest or being pulled over by federal agents. Here you’ll find answers to common questions, ranging from whether you can legally be arrested at a peaceful protest to what to say prior to being detained.

Please note that for specific immigration-related legal questions, consult a lawyer.

I’m going to protest. Can I be arrested?

So long as the protest remains peaceful, you can’t be legally arrested. Citizens and non-citizens alike have First Amendment rights, which include the right to peacefully gather in public forums like streets, sidewalks, parks or plazas. Check with organizers to see if they have a permit for the protest, especially if people plan to march in the streets.

People without status, however, should be careful. According to the National Immigration Law Center, courts have not been consistent with their First Amendment rulings involving people who are undocumented. If you do choose to protest, have a plan in place in case you need to make a quick exit.

Claudia Murphy, a patrol lieutenant for the Bellingham Police Department, said police leadership will have conversations with organizers ahead of time to get an idea of the number of participants, where the gathering is happening and collect contact information.

“That has worked out really, really well for us being able to have that open line of communication,” she said. “Because the people who are gathering for the protest, they also want their folks to be safe.”

But if illegal activity, like an assault, breaks out, then police do have the right to arrest perpetrators.

“Once laws are broken, it is no longer a First Amendment right to do that,” Murphy said.

Can I film police officers or federal agents?

Yes. Filming police officers or federal agents is protected under the First Amendment. Plus, it’s legal in Washington.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem equated filming federal officers to doxxing in July during a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on the doxxing comment in September.

“We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.

That flies in the face of what seven federal circuit courts have ruled: filming law enforcement is a protected right. The Supreme Court, however, has not weighed in on the issue.

Chicago-based journalists filed a lawsuit in October alleging federal immigration agents suppressed the journalists’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights by using excessive force.

Can immigration agents come into my house or board public transportation without a warrant?

It depends.

Because we in Whatcom and Skagit counties live within 100 miles of the border, federal law allows for Customs and Border Patrol Agents and other immigration officials to board buses and trains without a warrant. You can also be pulled over if federal law enforcement suspects someone in the vehicle committed an immigration violation or a federal crime.

On the train or bus, federal agents should ask brief questions about passengers’ immigration status and ask to see documentation. But passengers have the right to remain silent.

Should you be pulled over, federal agents should be asking questions related to why they conducted the traffic stop. You can ask about probable cause for the stop and the agent should state why. You can also ask if you’re free to leave, or you can remain silent.

However, noncitizens can still be detained without a warrant.

To make matters more complicated, for those living within 25 miles of the Canadian border in Whatcom County, immigration agents are allowed to enter private property, like a yard or ranch land, without a warrant, according to the ACLU. But their jurisdiction is narrow. If agents want to enter a house, or “dwelling,” they cannot do so without a warrant. Those inside the house can also request to review a signed warrant by a judge.

Recent reporting by the Associated Press revealed a memo circulating by ICE authorizing officers to enter homes without warrants signed by federal judges. Rather, officers can enter the home of someone with a final order of removal so long as they have an administrative warrant. The memo jeopardizes rights under the Fourth Amendment which bars unlawful searches and seizures.

Are local police and sheriff deputies working with immigration agents?

In Washington state, under the 2019 Keep Washington Working Act (KWW), it is illegal for Washington law enforcement to conduct civil immigration arrests in partnership with federal authorities.

Whatcom County Sheriff Donnell Tanksley said the last year has been one of reeducation in telling people that his office and deputies have a policy not to work with immigration authorities on civil arrests.

“Some people, not all people, but some people do not want to believe that local law enforcement are not working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities,” he said.

However, local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents if there is a criminal investigation into an individual.

Following an immigration-related detainment in Lynden in October, where members of the sheriff’s office’s SWAT team assisted in establishing a perimeter after federal law enforcement requested backup, Tanksley requested a meeting with the Washington state Attorney General’s Office to ensure he was in compliance with KWW.

An arrest warrant signed by a federal judge had been presented. The U.S. Border Patrol said the man arrested was a member of the Sureño gang and was under investigation for assault on a federal officer. Tanksley does not have the power to call the judge to request an explanation of the warrant.

The AG’s Office told Tanksley he was within the rights of the law.

“Maybe the optics didn’t look well, but it was there for a criminal violation,” he said. “I know a lot of people are concerned, but there’s definitely two different things going on here at the federal level that they’re doing with immigration, and what we’re doing here at the sheriff’s office is criminal investigations.”

How can I visibly tell police and federal immigration agents apart?

Bellingham police officers will have police on the back of their uniforms as well as on the front of their vests, said Murphy, the police lieutenant. The uniforms are deep blue in color and the badges feature Old City Hall on them — a unique identifier.

Police SWAT teams will wear a muted brown color but will still have a badge that says Bellingham Police on it.

Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office deputies will have patches with the sheriff’s office logo on them.

As for federal agents, it depends on the agency. Most recently, with federal immigration enforcement, agents have been in plain clothes with brown or black vests. Sometimes, the patches on the vest read ERO, or Enforcement Removal Operation, or HSI, Homeland Security Investigation. ICE can also be seen on patches. But sometimes, there is only “police” on the vest.

Federal immigration agents have also been frequently covering their faces with masks. Local law enforcement officials will not wear face coverings.

In Washington state, the legislature is mulling a bill to make it illegal for local, state and federal law enforcement to wear face coverings. California put a similar law in place at the beginning of the year.

State law already requires officers to be “reasonably identifiable” while on duty but does not specify language about face coverings.

What do I do if I’m stopped by federal immigration agents?

Remain calm and don’t run away. Don’t lie to officers or show false documentation.

Henry Hwang, directing attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, told KUOW he has differing advice based on someone’s immigration status on what to do if they’re pulled over by ICE.

Hwang said if you’re undocumented, remain silent and ask if you’re free to go. If the agent says no, then say you would like to speak with a lawyer. If you have legal status or are a citizen, you could show proof, such as a passport. Again, ask if you’re free to go.

If you’re at a protest and you’re stopped, ask if you’re free to leave. And if you are arrested, ask police why.

Should you be arrested or somebody you know be detained by immigration agents, have an emergency plan in place. That means making sure someone can take care of children and memorizing emergency numbers, including that of a lawyer.

Immigration court doesn’t guarantee a lawyer, but a detained person still has the right to speak with one.

And some Republicans were publicly digging in, suggesting that the shooting was a tragic but inevitable outcome in a city that declines to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

“I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Mr. King said.","The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by a federal agent in Minneapolis has set off alarm bells among Republicans, fueling worries within the party about a potential backlash to violent tactics by the Trump administration in its immigration crackdown.

Some Republicans came forward on Sunday to vigorously defend the administration and place blame for the death of the man, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen, on forces on the left who oppose President Trump’s immigration policies. But many party leaders stayed silent, and some G.O.P. lawmakers both in the center and on the hard right raised grave concerns, suggesting a rare moment of dissent over a killing carried out in broad daylight and recorded by bystanders.

Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is facing a primary challenger backed by Mr. Trump, called for a “full joint federal and state investigation” into the fatal shooting of Mr. Pretti, in a statement that called his death “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Mr. Cassidy said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”

Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement on Saturday night that he had requested testimony from the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Even Representative James Comer of Kentucky, a staunch ally of the president’s, appeared to concede that federal agents were killing innocent people in the immigration crackdown, as he suggested on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that Mr. Trump should consider removing ICE agents from Minneapolis and sending them elsewhere.

“If the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way, and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals?’” said Mr. Comer, the chairman of the Oversight Committee.

Their reactions reflected a current of discontent among at least some Republicans about the bare-knuckled tactics of Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown. They are unlikely to signal a sea change in a party that is firmly in the president’s grip, but could indicate a political red flag for the G.O.P. as it fights to maintain control of Congress in midterm elections in November.

A poll from The New York Times and Siena University conducted this month showed that roughly half of voters supported Mr. Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico, but that a sizable majority — 61 percent — believed that ICE’s tactics had gone too far.

“The death of Americans — what we’re seeing on TV — it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, told CNN on Sunday. “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” He said that there was broad agreement with Mr. Trump’s emphasis on sealing the border, but that “he’s getting bad advice right now.”

“We have to enforce federal laws, but we need to know what is the end game,” Mr. Stitt added.

In his own scathing statement, Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, a Republican who has a long record of criticizing and clashing with Mr. Trump, condemned the immigration crackdown, saying it was “at best” a law enforcement failure and “at worst it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”

Prominent gun rights groups who count conservative Republicans among their members also raised concern about the shooting, as did former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote in a lengthy social media post that the right would be outraged if federal agents under the Biden administration had done to a “MAGA supporter” what was done to Mr. Pretti in Minneapolis.

Neither Speaker Mike Johnson nor Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, had commented on the shooting as of Sunday evening, though a senior Senate Republican aide said the party would to push ahead as planned this week with a spending package that would fund the Department of Homeland Security, over the opposition of Democrats.

And some Republicans were publicly digging in, suggesting that the shooting was a tragic but inevitable outcome in a city that declines to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, described the episode as a “tragic shooting in Minnesota where Border Patrol agents used deadly force against an armed protester trying to impede a lawful arrest.”

“It is a direct result of the heated rhetoric and over-the-top reaction toward ICE, who are simply trying to enforce the law in sanctuary cities,” Mr. Graham said. “You have every right to protest and you have every right to disagree with President Trump. No one has the right to impede law enforcement officers carrying out their duties.”

(His account of the shooting was not supported by video of the events.)

But others, including some Republicans from politically safe districts, said they wanted an investigation into the killing and said they were upset by the videos widely circulating that showed that Mr. Pretti was restrained and disarmed before agents fired multiple shots into his back.

Representative Michael Baumgartner, Republican of Washington, said in a statement that he was “disturbed by what I’ve seen from today’s video from Minnesota.”

“It’s critically important that the American people and Congress be given a better understanding of how immigration enforcement is being handled,” Mr. Baumgartner wrote on social media, “including the methods federal law enforcement officers are using to prioritize, identify and arrest suspected targets, the training they are receiving, the implementation of body cameras, the threats they face in conducting operations and the challenges posed by sanctuary cities and states.”

While Mr. Garbarino, the New York Republican who is chairman of the homeland security panel, did not mention Minneapolis in his statement, he said: “I take my oversight duties for the department seriously, and Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Mr. Cassidy’s call for a joint investigation, which came as he is fighting for his political career amid accusations that he has been insufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump, was a break with the Trump administration’s approach. Federal officials had said the Department of Homeland Security would lead the investigation into the shooting and initially blocked Minnesota authorities from examining the scene of the shooting, according to a state official.

Other Republicans who are not seeking re-election, including Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, also endorsed a fuller investigation.

Some conservatives expressed alarm about the administration’s attempts to justify the shooting by noting that Mr. Pretti, who had a license for a concealed firearm, was carrying a pistol when he was killed.

“Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don’t understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,” Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and a libertarian who often clashes with Mr. Trump, wrote on social media.

Senate Democrats had said on Saturday that they would not vote for a spending package needed to avert a government shutdown at the end of the week if it included money for the Department of Homeland Security, and Republicans had considered trying to drop that portion of the deal. But the senior aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans have yet to be announced, said the legislation, which also funds the Pentagon and other programs, would move ahead as one bill, raising the risk of a funding lapse.

Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he “hates” government shutdowns but that he might be forced to back one this week. In November, Mr. King was one of eight senators in the Democratic caucus who broke their party’s blockade and voted with Republicans to advance legislation to end the government shutdown.

“I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Mr. King said.

“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!” he wrote. “By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”

The posts apparently referred to the deaths this month of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, two U.S. citizens and Minneapolis residents who were shot and killed by federal immigration agents.

Top Trump administration officials immediately and without evidence accused each of the shooting victims of “domestic terrorism” and said they were seeking to harm federal agents. In both cases, video footage from the scene contradicted the Trump administration’s version of events.

He drew a contrast with Republican-led states, including Texas, Florida and Louisiana, where he said that immigration operations had not been met with the same level of opposition.

From the United States to Europe, immigration is ever less often discussed as a humanitarian issue and ever more often described in terms of an “invasion,” functionally recasting desperate civilians as armed soldiers.
Politically, the invasion story is more easily digestible than the grim actual stories of displaced people.
Such invasion stories about immigrants are, of course, anything but new, after centuries in which a nationalistic desire for hard borders has undergirded so many claims that war and violence are necessary.
And today, Americans in cities from Chicago to Los Angeles have rallied to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration raids.","Borders as Crime Scenes and Crimes

After a year of gutting the United States government, deploying armed jackboots to American cities, and bombing at least seven countries, the Trump administration kicked off 2026 by invading Venezuela and kidnapping its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores. In the wake of that assault, President Trump doubled down on his abandonment of the isolationist positions he once supposedly held, threatening military action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and Mexico. He then vowed that the U.S. would come to “own” Greenland either “the easy way” or “the hard way.”

In truth, American imperialism defines much of this country’s history, but the latest escalation comes at a time when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have also been deployed around the nation to grab immigrants off the streets and whisk them to detention centers. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to preach the jingoistic gospel of stopping the arrival of new refugees and migrants, while blasting European governments over migration — even as he vows to launch military campaigns that will undoubtedly result in further mass displacements and fleeing people crossing borders in search of safety.

Destabilizing countries the world over and then attacking the people who flee those wars is, of course, nothing new. From the September 11th attacks in 2001 until September 2020, this country’s war on terror, according to one study, displaced an estimated 37 million people in eight countries. And that figure doesn’t even include several million displaced during smaller conflicts the U.S. participated in from Chad to Tunisia, Mali to Saudi Arabia. Nor does it include the number of people displaced by Israel’s five wars since 2008 in and around the Gaza Strip, its land theft in the occupied West Bank, or its frequent airstrikes in Lebanon, Syria, and even Iran, all made possible thanks to Washington’s financial and military support.

When it comes to Washington demonizing the people displaced by its weapons, just ask the Palestinians. Millions of them live strewn across the map of the Middle East and beyond thanks to Israel’s ongoing military occupation and the American tax dollars that have enabled it.

“Eight Lives, Gone Just Like That”

In March 2015, I sat in the back of a taxi bound for Saida, a Lebanese coastal city a little less than an hour south of Beirut. The taxi hummed down the highway, the sea blurring through the windows to our right, and then swerved inland. Saida is more than 30 miles north of the country’s boundary with Israel and some 50 miles west of the border with Syria, but even that deep inside Lebanon, a de facto border appeared in the front windshield. The driver made a series of turns, braked, and inched toward a military checkpoint outside Ain al-Hilweh, a Palestinian refugee camp.

Lebanese soldiers appeared on either side of the vehicle. Their job was to decide who could — and could not — enter the camp. After reading over our documents and ensuring that we had the proper military permission to enter the camp, the soldiers motioned the driver to move forward. We eased in amid a sprawl of ramshackle homes, many built atop one another. It was a dusty, humid day, but people clogged the streets. Children punted a soccer ball back and forth in the road. Motorbikes trembled over potholes. Men stood around in knots, smoking cigarettes and sipping coffee, and some walked by with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders.

Along with an American photographer and a Lebanese reporter, I had gone to Ain al-Hilweh, the largest of Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian camps, to speak to people who had been doubly displaced by the war in neighboring Syria. As that civil war tore through the country — a war that drew interventions from the U.S., Great Britain, France, Israel, Russia, Iran, and several other places — Palestinian refugees from Syria found themselves fleeing to Lebanon. The population of Ain al-Hilweh alone had swelled by tens of thousands.

Of the Palestinians we met that day, the only ones who had ever set foot in their ancestral homeland were those who had been born before — and lived through — the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. What we’d soon learn, however, was that a term like double displacement failed to capture the extent to which borders had governed every aspect of their lives in permanent and repeated exile.

In a corner store with barren shelves, we found Afaf Dashe sitting in a small chair near the counter. At 70 years old, she had survived the Nakba — Arabic for catastrophe, the term Palestinians use to describe the ethnic cleansing of their country since 1948 — as a three-year-old girl when her family fled to Syria. She had grown up in a suburb of Damascus, married, and raised children. When civil war started to rip through Syria in 2011, she and her family gritted it out through four years of barrel bombs, airstrikes, and shelling before they finally escaped.

While Ain al-Hilweh offered some respite, it offered neither true safety nor stability. In Lebanon, decades of state repression, lethal Israeli interventions, and failed Palestinian rebellions had left such refugees particularly vulnerable. Rather than setting down new roots in that dismal camp, Afaf explained, three of her daughters, along with five of her grandchildren, had decided to risk taking the long, often deadly journey to Europe. After crossing from Syria to Lebanon, they parted with Afaf and continued on by sea to Libya. They then paid smugglers to board a boat bound for Italy. As Afaf reached that point in her story, tears gathered in her eyes and she paused, for a long moment staring into the distance, seemingly at nothing, before turning back to us. The boat carrying her family, she said, had capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. “Eight lives, gone just like that. For my whole life, I’ve seen Palestinians move from tragedy to tragedy, and from nakba to nakba.”

More than once in her life, it occurred to me, wars had pushed her, her children, and her grandchildren across borders and, in a distinctly embattled world, borders decided where she and her loved ones could possibly move, where they could live, and where they could die. I thought about the U.S. passport in my pocket, the relative ease with which I had crossed borders throughout my adult life, and the American tax dollars that helped doom Afaf to a life of permanent exile. She would be the first person I met who had lost loved ones simply looking to cross a border to find safety, but by no means the last.

Violent Borders

For tens of millions of people, borders are not merely places where the risk of violence is present. Borders are, by definition, violent. Borders are not merely crossed. Borders must be survived and endured. Borders are not only walls and razor wire. Borders are guards and police, surveillance cameras and drones, batons and bullets. For those tens of millions of people, borders don’t stop where one country ends and the next begins; they stalk and haunt across endless miles and years. Borders are both crime scenes and crimes, with nationalism the motive.

For people forced to flee, the violence doesn’t stop once they escape countries being bombed or economically strangled. The journey itself offers its own slate of dangers. The International Migration Organization has recorded more than 33,200 instances of refugees and migrants dying or going missing in the Mediterranean Sea alone since 2014. Between 1994 and 2024, rights groups estimate that more than 80,000 people died in the deserts or rivers on and around the U.S.-Mexico border.

Throughout the last decade, I’ve traveled along the European refugee trail, stopping off in countries across the Balkans and Central and Western Europe, while also reporting from American communities along the heavily militarized U.S.-Mexico border. Wherever I’ve gone, the displaced have horror stories to tell — of people drowned at sea, of migrants shot along borders, and others who simply disappeared along “the refugee trail.” At a shelter in Belgrade, Serbia, Afghans who had fled the fallout of the U.S. war in their country and walked the endless land route from Turkey spoke of the Bulgarian border police who had detained, threatened, or beaten them along the way. On the Serbian border with Hungary, Moroccans and Algerians told me of policemen who beat their feet with batons to deter them from ever trying to cross the border again. In Greece, young men from Sudan and Somalia — their countries no strangers to U.S. intervention — described the tear gas and rubber bullets they faced on the country’s northern border with Macedonia. In Turkey, Syrians told me about the dogs that Bulgarian border police sicced on them. In Arizona, people recalled walking for so long in the Mexican desert that the soles of their shoes tore apart.

Perhaps more than anything else, the idea of strong borders has fueled the fascist-style surge that now grips the United States and significant parts of Europe. From the time Donald Trump first entered the Oval Office in January 2017, far-right and ultranationalist parties around Europe have also gained ground in ways that would once have been unimaginable — and where the far right has yet to take power, center-left and liberal parties have often swung hard to the right on their immigration and border enforcement policies.

In one breath, even Democratic Party officials in the United States, still singing praises of liberal democracy, are also promising to crack down on immigration and strengthen border enforcement in a desperate bid to appear tougher in the age of Donald Trump. In the United Kingdom, the center-left Labour Party ousted the Conservatives in 2024, only to put into practice anti-immigrant policies that align with those even further to the right, like Nigel Farage and his UK Independence Party. In Greece, even after the violent neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was banned, following years of anti-immigrant violence, the nominally center-right New Democracy Party adopted and repackaged its rhetoric in slightly modified form, while placing a former fascist in charge of its migration ministry. From the United States to Europe, immigration is ever less often discussed as a humanitarian issue and ever more often described in terms of an “invasion,” functionally recasting desperate civilians as armed soldiers.

Politically, the invasion story is more easily digestible than the grim actual stories of displaced people. Unsurprisingly, it has found ever larger audiences. And consider that a grim irony, since so many of the people crossing into the U.S. and Europe, even before they faced deadly journeys at sea and militarized borders, were driven from their countries at least in part due to American and European involvement in mass violence and policies designed to foster economic collapse in their homelands.

Such invasion stories about immigrants are, of course, anything but new, after centuries in which a nationalistic desire for hard borders has undergirded so many claims that war and violence are necessary. In 1908, a decade before she herself was deported from the United States, the Lithuanian-American anarchist Emma Goldman pointed to the violence at the heart of such nationalism during a speech in San Francisco. “Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate,” she told her audience. “Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot consider themselves nobler, better, grander, more intelligent than those living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.”

Hope in the Pushback

In the decade since I started covering migration and borders, I have also witnessed what resistance to the anti-immigrant far right might look like. In Greece, activists and volunteers, anarchists, socialists, and everyday people worked together to do what they could to offer an alternative to the grim realities displaced people were experiencing. On Greek islands like Lesbos, humanitarians gathered by the shore to help the displaced disembark from boats. Others headed out to sea to rescue people from sinking vessels. In Athens, anarchists and other leftists occupied abandoned buildings, refashioning them into squats that displaced immigrants could inhabit without the overcrowding and decrepit living conditions of the official camps. In Germany, everyday people opened their homes to newly arrived refugees. In Austin, Texas, the congregants of a church told me about how they had taken in asylum seekers facing deportation.

And today, Americans in cities from Chicago to Los Angeles have rallied to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration raids. Ever since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis in January, ever more protesters have taken to the streets in growing numbers to voice their opposition to state-sanctioned murder and the Trump administration’s drive to carry out mass deportations fueled more by cruelty than any concern for the country’s safety. As the president deepens federal deployments and threatens to use the military against what he calls the “invasion from within,” those demonstrators undoubtedly understand that their own fates are wrapped up with those of immigrants and refugees. Squats, humanitarian aid, and mass protests may not stop the cruel wheels of the anti-immigrant political machine, but they do offer glimmers of hope at a time when hope is in short supply.

In the early months of 2026, that hope may be needed more than ever, in part because all too many Americans and Europeans continue to empower politicians who recycle the tired argument that, if there were fewer immigrants, life in their countries would be more prosperous and peaceful. In the lead-up to the 2024 election, Donald Trump bluntly assured Americans that immigrants were invaders who were “poisoning the blood of our country.” During the first year of his second term, his administration snatched international students off the streets, separated families, and shipped immigrants off to foreign prisons. Meanwhile, he continued to repeatedly tell Americans that they were being “invaded,” a story that comes with a painful body count, while courting what inevitably loiters behind nationalism and nativism: fear.

In her novel White Teeth, Zadie Smith put all of that in perspective this way: “But it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears — dissolution, disappearance.”

Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimated that more than 122 million people across the world had been displaced as a result of war, violence, or persecution, a number that marked a decade-long high and was also the 10th consecutive year that the total number of people displaced across the globe had increased. Worse yet, war and military campaigns are still driving people from their homes globally.

Sooner than later, such wars and other disasters will result in yet more people seeking safety in Europe and the United States. When that happens, there is little doubt that far-right leaders, hoping to offload the blame for their own failures, will once again stand in front of us and claim that state violence is necessary to protect our country from an “invasion.” Then, you’ll have to make a choice: You can buy into the claim that the most powerful countries on the planet are the victims of invasions or remember that actual invasions and the military campaigns that create lethal cycles of mass displacement are happening in all too many places on this planet. That choice will determine just how much hope there is for a world where desperate people escaping disasters they had no hand in creating don’t have to consider crossing a manmade line a matter of negotiating their very survival.

SARAH MCCAMMON: OK.
SARAH MCCAMMON: So there is bipartisan pushback against this killing and the Trump administration's response.
After Saturday's killing, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told NBC she just can't vote for the current funding package.","SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:

This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Sarah McCammon. Tensions remain high in Minnesota, where local and federal officials continue to fight over the killing of Alex Pretti. The 37-year-old U.S. citizen and VA nurse was shot dead by federal officers during an immigration enforcement protest in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti's killing has prompted strong bipartisan condemnation today in Congress, a forceful defense from the Trump administration and the prospect of another government shutdown. NPR's Luke Garrett joins us now to explain. Hi, Luke.

LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Hello, Sarah.

SARAH MCCAMMON: Well, let's start in Minneapolis, Luke. What do we know about the investigation into Pretti's killing?

GARRETT: Local and state law enforcement remain at odds with federal officials. The Department of Homeland Security is investigating this deadly shooting, but they're not cooperating or sharing information with those local and state investigators. Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota accused the Trump administration of a, quote, ""cover-up"" Sunday. She told NPR the federal government is ignoring a recent court order that allows state investigators access to the evidence around Pretti's killing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)

TINA SMITH: Our state investigators had to get a warrant to have access to the evidence of the shooting of Alex Pretti. And even then, the federal agents refused to give them access to the evidence.

GARRETT: Now, Smith called on the Trump administration to preserve the evidence and share it with those local and state investigators. And it's worth noting here, Sarah, that three moderate GOP senators echoed this call. Those are Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski went further and called for congressional hearings as well.

SARAH MCCAMMON: And what are we hearing from the Trump administration?

GARRETT: The Trump administration, you know, continues to defend the federal agents who killed Pretti. They also criticized the 37-year-old VA nurse, you know, saying he was, quote, ""perpetrating violence."" Here's the head of President Trump's immigration operation, Border Patrol commander, Greg Bovino, on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STATE OF THE UNION WITH JAKE TAPPER AND DANA BASH"")

GREG BOVINO: That suspect injected himself into that law enforcement's - into that law enforcement situation with a weapon.

GARRETT: Now Sarah, the video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far refute that assertion. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents. And to be clear, legally carrying a concealed firearm is protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.

SARAH MCCAMMON: OK. So what are gun rights groups saying about this?

GARRETT: So they are taking issue with a post from Trump-appointed U.S. attorney Bill Essayli. He said if a U.S. citizen approaches law enforcement with a gun, federal officers, quote, ""will be legally justified in shooting you."" The gun rights group the NRA, you know, called this post, quote, ""dangerous and wrong."" Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky and frequent Trump critic, went a step further saying Essayli had, quote, ""no business in law enforcement or government.""

SARAH MCCAMMON: So there is bipartisan pushback against this killing and the Trump administration's response. What can Congress actually do?

GARRETT: Well, Senate Democrats are poised to partially shut down the government. The deadline for government funding is Friday, and the Senate still needs to approve the funding for some government departments. One of them is the DHS. After Saturday's killing, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told NBC she just can't vote for the current funding package. Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine have all said they won't vote for it, either. That's notable. They're very moderate Democratic senators as well. So on Saturday, Senate Majority - Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would not vote to advance the spending package if it includes this DHS funding, so it's setting up a fight in Congress.

SARAH MCCAMMON: NPR's Luke Garrett, thanks so much.

Federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, early on Saturday, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway in the Midwestern city, less than three weeks after an immigration officer fired on Renee Good, also 37, killing her in her car.

President Donald Trump's administration quickly claimed that Pretti had intended to harm the federal agents – as it did after Good's death – pointing to a pistol it said was discovered on him. However, video shared widely on social media and verified by US media outlets showed Pretti never drew the weapon, with agents firing around 10 shots at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with chemical irritant and thrown to the ground.

The video further inflamed ongoing protests in Minneapolis against the presence of federal agents, with around 1,000 people participating in a demonstration on Sunday. One person held a cardboard sign that read: ""Be Pretti, be Good.""

Trump slams Minnesota Democratic officials

Trump provocatively attributed the deaths to Minnesota's Democratic elected officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, writing on his Truth Social platform: ""Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE."" ""Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,"" he added.

While administration officials have defended the officer who shot Pretti, Trump in a brief Sunday interview with the Wall Street Journal declined twice to say whether the officer had acted appropriately. ""We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,"" the president told the paper

US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also said an investigation was necessary to get a full understanding of the killing. Asked if agents had already removed the pistol from Pretti when they fired on him, Blanche said: ""I do not know. And nobody else knows, either. That's why we're doing an investigation.""

When asked on Sunday what she would say to Pretti's parents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said: ""Just that I'm grieved for them."" ""I truly am. I can't even imagine losing a child,"" she told Fox News show The Sunday Briefing. She said more clarity would come as an investigation progresses.

'Sickening lies'

After top officials described Pretti as an ""assassin"" who had assaulted the agents, Pretti's parents issued a statement Saturday condemning the administration's ""sickening lies"" about their son.

Barack and Michelle Obama, meanwhile, issued a forceful statement condemning the killing of Pretti by federal agents, saying it exemplified President Trump's ""assault"" on American values. ""The killing of Alex Pretti is a heartbreaking tragedy. It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,"" the former president and first lady said in a joint statement.

Hours later Bill Clinton delivered a fierce indictment of the current administration, saying peaceful protesters ""have been arrested, beaten, teargassed, and most searingly, in the cases of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot and killed."" ""All of this is unacceptable,"" Clinton said in a statement as he urged Americans to ""stand up, speak out."" ""If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.""

'Joint' probe

Their comments came after multiple senators from Trump's Republican Party called for a thorough probe into the killing, and for cooperation with local authorities. ""There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,"" Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said. The Trump administration controversially excluded local investigators from a probe into Good's killing.

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz posed a question directly to the president during a press briefing Sunday, asking: ""What's the plan, Donald Trump?"" ""What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state?""

On Sunday, business leaders from 60 corporations headquartered in Minnesota – including retailer Target, food giant General Mills and several professional sports franchises – signed an open letter ""calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.""

Court order

Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed to heavily Democratic Minneapolis for weeks, after conservative media reported on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants. Trump has repeatedly amplified the racially-tinged accusations, including on Sunday when he posted on his Truth Social platform: ""Minnesota is a Criminal COVER UP of the massive Financial Fraud that has gone on!""

The city, known for its bitterly cold winters, has one of the country's highest concentrations of Somali immigrants. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison pushed back against Trump's claim, telling reporters ""it's not about fraud, because if he sent people who understand forensic accounting, we'd be having a different conversation. But he's sending armed masked men.""

Since ""Operation Metro Surge"" began, many residents have carried whistles to notify others of the presence of immigration agents, while sometimes violent skirmishes have broken out between the officers and protesters. Local authorities have sued the federal government seeking a court order to suspend the operation, with a first hearing set for Monday.

Recent polling has shown voters increasingly upset with Trump's domestic immigration operations, as videos of masked agents seizing people off sidewalks – including children – and dramatic stories of US citizens being detained proliferate.",https://img.lemde.fr/2026/01/25/0/0/8256/5504/1440/960/60/0/652a7f4_ftp-1-jwmujxq72hyo-5987088-01-06.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:20.449016

""Law enforcement should conduct an objective investigation and get the facts. We defend people's free speech and right to protest,"" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a statement to Axios, though he added that it is ""not right to interfere or obstruct law enforcement in their official actions.""

Zoom in: The responses of Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) to two different shootings in her home state offer a revealing picture of how the GOP's tone has shifted since the start of the year.

After Renee Good was killed on Jan. 7, Fischbach called the incident a ""targeted assault on ICE agents"" in a post on X, writing, ""I stand with the officer who acted in self-defense to save lives.""

On Sunday, she wrote after Pretti was killed: ""I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in Minneapolis and fully support the ongoing investigation into this incident.""

Between the lines: Some Republicans also broke with the administration for saying Pretti should not have had a gun on him.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) write on X that ""ICE should not leave Minnesota"" but that ""carrying a gun & magazines is not an invitation for cops to shoot you.""

""Fighting cops (esp. w/ a gun) might be,"" he added.

The other side: DHS still had a semblance of Democratic support on Capitol Hill before the shooting, but what little was left appears to have evaporated.

Rep. Laura Gillen (D-N.Y.), one of the seven swing-district centrists who voted to pass a DHS funding bill last week, signed on as a co-sponsor to Kelly's articles of impeachment.

Even some support from senators began to trickle in on Sunday, with centrist Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) calling for Noem's impeachment.

The articles of impeachment stood at Democratic 120 co-sponsors as of Sunday evening — well over half of the 213 Democrats in the House. Kelly can force them to a vote, though it is not clear if and when she plans to do that.

What to watch: The most immediate impact of the shooting will be in the Senate, where a package of six spending bills is now in significant peril.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said this weekend that Democrats won't vote for the DHS funding bill.

The package would also fund a huge portion of the federal government beyond DHS, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Transportation and Labor.

Several of the Senate Democrats who voted to end the last government shutdown — including Rosen and Sens. Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.) — have said they will oppose DHS funding.",https://images.axios.com/rrCwWKTMb3J04XFlU0X0vWGNhNU=/0x197:5245x3147/1366x768/2026/01/26/1769393449040.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 02:59:02.340350

Joining us now is NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Welcome.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.

RASCOE: So, you know, as you just heard, there's a lot we don't know about the shooting yesterday in Minneapolis. But what strikes you politically about this?

LIASSON: One thing that strikes me is how the Trump administration tries to get out immediately after these incidents with a narrative that may or may not be true. This happened with the shooting of Renee Macklin Good just a few weeks ago, when the administration said she carried out an act of domestic terrorism. Trump called her a professional agitator, accused Good of trying to run over the ICE agent who shot her, before there was an investigation or much evidence of this.

We're also seeing some pushback from Congress. Senate Democrats say they will not vote for the Department of Homeland Security's funding bill. And all this occurs at a time when Trump's approval ratings are dropping. Immigration has been the aspect of Trump's policies that was the most popular. Voters in general approve of his efforts to secure the Southern border and to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

But new polls show that a majority of voters disapprove of ICE's tactics. Now, a New York Times poll taken right before the second fatal shooting shows that majorities of voters disapprove of the way ICE is doing its job. Only 36% of voters approve, and 61% said ICE had, quote, ""gone too far."" Now, this could have an impact on the midterm elections, even though Trump himself is not on the ballot.

RASCOE: I want to - you know, moving on another topic. I want to ask you about yet another tariff threat from President Trump. He's now saying he'll impose a hundred-percent tariff if Canada moves ahead with the trade deal with China. Is this fallout over Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's remarks at Davos last week?

LIASSON: It seems like it. Carney gave a very candid speech, laying out what he called a rupture in the world order. He encouraged middle countries like his and other NATO allies to work more independently, saying they can't rely on the U.S. anymore as a stabilizing force. That speech got a standing ovation. Donald Trump didn't like it at all, and then he threatened the 100% tariffs on Canada.

And the trade deal that Canada made with China - where they agreed to lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles, China agreed to lower tariffs on some Canadian agriculture products - interestingly enough, Trump was for it. He seems to have reversed himself. When the deal was announced last week, he said it was a good thing. He said, it's what you should be doing. He said, quote, ""if you can get a deal with China, you should do that."" But then he changed his mind. He now is attacking Carney for being ungrateful. And the bottom line here is that Donald Trump is very unpredictable.

RASCOE: Well, and given that he reverses himself so much over tariffs, are these threats kind of losing their punch?

LIASSON: Well, they could be. He does have a pattern of blustering then backing down. This is something termed the TACO theory for Trump always chickens out. And some of these threats seem to be performative for Trump. At times, he sounds like he's in a ""Godfather"" movie. Take a listen to what he said during his speech at Davos where he tried to coerce Denmark and other U.S. allies to give the United States control of Greenland.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.

LIASSON: And I think it's apt that the term TACO came originated with Wall Street traders because the markets seem to be the last guardrails on Trump's behavior. When he threatened force to take Greenland, when he threatened to put tariffs on U.S. allies, the markets tumbled. Then when he backed off, the markets bounced back. But the bottom line again is, the whole - his behavior is so unpredictable, and it makes some sort of sense that other countries - even long-term US allies - are now looking to find their own path and make deals with other superpowers like China.

RASCOE: Well, what are some of the long-term implications of Trump's aggressive posture toward U.S. allies?

LIASSON: They could be profound. If the Western alliance permanently ruptures, the implications could be very big. Article 5 of NATO says, an attack on one member is an attack on all. All protect each other. But Donald Trump has called that into question, raising doubts about whether he would come to Europe's aid if it was invaded by Russia.

And the question hanging over Europe right now is, if the alliance does rupture, is it possible for Europe to rearm itself to make up for losing the U.S. as an ally? Does Europe have the means or the will to do this, to make up for the intelligence and the weapon systems and the nuclear umbrella that they get from the United States? Estimates are that it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars and take decades.

So this is a big question. There really isn't an alternative to the Western alliance for European countries. And in the meantime, Russia is happy to see these divisions. Vladimir Putin has been trying to break the Western alliance for his entire life, and right now, he's watching it break apart possibly from the inside, so this is a big gift to Putin and a lot of uncertainty for European countries going forward.

RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara.

LIASSON: Thank you.

It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents.","Following the killing of Minnesota nurse Alex Pretti at the hands of a Border Patrol officer on Saturday, Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates are now laying out their plans on how to deal with increasingly violent federal immigration enforcement actions that have resulted in three shootings in three weeks, with two now ending in death.

Local and state Democratic officials in Minnesota immediately condemned Saturday’s shooting as protests ramped up, while Republican President Donald Trump threatened again to send military forces to Minnesota, according to reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, Minnesota Reformer.

In Michigan, the three Democrats in the Senate race followed suit, but they each have slightly different policy contemplations to either rein in, curb or abolish the executive branch’s increasingly troubling immigration force.

Former health official and Bernie Sanders-wing progressive Abdul El-Sayed has called for the outright dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position he’s held since 2018, a message he has amplified in the wake of the government killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7.

“The murderers of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were eight-year and ten-year agents — training isn’t the issue,” El-Sayed said in a statement issued Sunday. “ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against and our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot? Ask the families of Renee Good or Alex Pretti — both American Citizens — if ICE is protecting us. There can be no justification for lawlessness in the name of the law. And now is not the time to put political convenience. Trump is trying to normalize military force on peaceful streets, tearing apart our constitutional rights one by one. Our tax dollars are being used to kill Americans on our streets rather than save lives in our hospitals like Alex did.”

El-Sayed added that the U.S. must work to secure its border and work toward comprehensive immigration reform through legislation, and not through continued executive action. ICE, in that regard, has been shown to be “irredeemable,” he said.

“Retraining won’t fix it,” El-Sayed said. “And the only reason to deny this is political cowardice. … Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

While El-Sayed stated his belief that this stance sets him apart from his opponents, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) has called for denying further funding for ICE and has demanded the immediate and sweeping overhaul of the agency. She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.

“Another person was killed by ICE in Minneapolis, after state leaders told them to leave, local officials told them to leave, and local law enforcement told them to leave,” McMorrow said in a statement on Saturday. “But Trump’s ICE continues on its collision course making our communities LESS safe — not more. Congress: not one more penny until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”

McMorrow and her Democratic colleagues in the Michigan Senate are working on a game plan to respond to ICE tactics in the Great Lakes state, and that includes legislation prohibiting officers from being masked on operations with full identification. News that ICE has been distributing memos indicating that the agency does not need a judicial warrant — but rather a Fourth Amendment-bucking administrative warrant signed by an ICE official — has also led state Democrats to consider banning entry by law enforcement without a warrant.

McMorrow has also called for strict, codified use-of-force policies on the federal level to give courts a clear line for when an officer has abused their station if it ends in a preventable violent encounter. Vetting of recruits and vigorous training is part of McMorrow’s plan, as well as a demand that ICE stop detaining American citizens.

“Continuing to provide funding to this agency without a complete overhaul to return it to its duty will be a failure to meet the moment,” McMorrow said in a statement released prior to the death of Pretti this weekend. “The leverage is there. And Democrats should force Republicans to the table to demand that Congress use its power of the purse to end this nightmare and restore the community safety that Americans are demanding.”

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Sunday said she was joining as a co-sponsor for H.R. 7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.

The bill would hire and train an estimated 200,000 local police officers across the nation, reverting funds to what Stevens called “proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.”

“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control — this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” Stevens said in a statement. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”

Other aspects of the bill include:

Reallocating $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions); and

Reallocating $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens voted against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which did pass in the U.S. House last week, and last year co-sponsored the VISIBLE Act to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities. Stevens has also called for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to be removed from office and co-sponsored articles for Noem’s impeachment.

What about Republicans?

The main Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, as of Sunday afternoon, had not issued a direct statement on the killing of Pretti. Rogers, who is endorsed by Trump, did issue several statements following the killing of Good, saying Democrats, and more specifically his Democratic opponents in the race, were persistently supporting “criminals over cops and America’s safety.”

“The Left’s never-ending war against law enforcement is an assault on Americans’ safety,” Rogers said in a statement issued Jan. 22. “These brave men and women protect our streets so that Michigan families can drive to work and walk to school without fear. But when you have Democrats releasing violent offenders onto the streets, and siding with criminals over cops, that all goes out the window.”

The only other Republican in the race, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Bernadette Smith, has not issued any public statement on either Pretti or Good’s deaths.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7744-2048x1536-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:02.727687

BG Independent News

As Americans watch ICE agents sweep into cities in Democratic states, some wonder who will be next. If ICE were to show up in this region, what rights do immigrants have? And what role can bystanders play legally?

To answer those questions, a “Build the Nest” training was hosted last week by LaConexion of Wood County, a non-profit community-based organization bringing unity, voice and representation to the immigrant community in the Northwest Ohio region.

The training was led by Mechelle Zarou, an attorney serving immigrant and refugee families in Northwest Ohio, and Brittany Ford from Welcome Toledo-Lucas County.

“We are building a nest of protection for immigrants across the state,” Ford explained.

Making immigrants and citizens aware of their rights has become rather complicated in the past year since the federal government is ignoring some long-standing constitutional human rights.

“We really have no pathway to legal immigration to the U.S.,” Ford said. There is no refugee or asylum system anymore – “unless you’re a white Afrikaner.”

“When we created these materials, we were in a very different world,” Zarou said.

The brutality seen in Minneapolis the last few weeks has shaken up faith in the rights people previously relied upon, she said.

“Everyone has rights,” Zarou said. “We’re holding them (ICE) accountable for following the law.”

Here are some tips offered for those who may encounter ICE:

If you are stopped on a street or in a public place, you have rights under the 5th Amendment to remain silent. Arrests cannot legally be made without warrants, unless ICE agents have reason to believe you have committed a crime – other than just being brown. In Ohio, while people are required to give police their name, address and date of birth – there is no requirement to answer questions about citizenship.

Carry the small “Know Your Rights” wallet-sized card with you. It states your rights as a human being. They are available with English writing on one side, and 18 different languages on the other.

Use your 4th Amendment rights to not give authorities permission to enter your home – unless they have a warrant signed by a judge or magistrate with your name on it. ICE has been using battering rams to violate that Constitutional right, Zarou said. “They should be held to comply with the law just like we are,” she said.

Ask to speak to an attorney. Since ICE is likely to confiscate your phone, have a phone number memorized for a legal aid attorney.

If you speak a language other than English, you have the right to an interpreter, as part of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. “Which hasn’t been rescinded yet,” Ford said.

Don’t sign anything without your attorney present. No matter how much pressure is exerted, do not sign paperwork that may be seen as a waiver of rights or an agreement to deportation. “There’s a lot of tricks being played,” Zarou said.

Do not lie to immigration enforcement since that could be used as reason for deportation. “Under no circumstances should anyone give false information,” Zarou said.

Detained immigrants have the right to ask to be released on bond.

In preparation for encounters with ICE, immigrants should collect and copy important documents. Zarou – who hopes this still holds true in America – does not recommend carrying your passport in public.

Make plans for temporary guardians for your children if it becomes necessary.

Ford and Zarou also talked about how local residents can be effective bystanders, offering support and documenting incidents legally.

Confrontations with ICE agents are often “highly charged situations,” so it’s important that bystanders not interfere, Zarou said. However, citizens are in no way required to help ICE enforce immigration laws.

“You can be a good bystander in a lot of different ways,” she said. For example:

Bystanders can lawfully videotape ICE officers. That has put some citizens at risk in some communities. So if videotaping is too scary, use your phone to record audio.

As soon as the incident is over, write down everything you witnessed right away, while it’s still fresh in your memory. “Eyewitness testimony still means something,” Zarou said.

If you witness someone being detained by ICE, you can advise that person to remain silent.

You can volunteer to deliver groceries to immigrant families who fear leaving their homes, or offer help with their children if the adults are detained.

“Safe spaces,” like churches should have some spaces labeled as “private” where ICE agents cannot legally enter.

During the meeting, Pastor Jeff Schooley asked if Bowling Green City Council could establish some local rules for ICE agents – such as not allowing facial masks, requiring body-cameras and limiting how local police assist ICE.

While some communities have taken such actions, the federal government is ignoring local ordinances, Ford and Zarou said. And declarations of “sanctuary city” status have made some communities targets for the federal government.

Ford also shared data about immigrants in Ohio. In 2023, there were approximately 550,000 living in the state – about 4.7% of the population. Many of them filled positions as physicians, professors, and STEM professions. Asians made up the largest percentage of immigrants, at 42%.

Ohio’s population grew from 2023-2024 – only due to immigrants, Ford said.

In 2024, immigrants paid total taxes of $7 billion in Ohio. “We need immigrants,” Ford said.",https://bgindependentmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-BGIN_logo_blue_square_300px-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:57:47.159363

Minnesotans shot – and even killed – at the hands of federal agents.

U.S. citizens arrested by masked officers in broad daylight.

These headlines should be enough to make anyone rethink their support of President Donald Trump’s immigration agencies.

The death of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday – caught on camera from multiple angles — must finally shock this country’s lawmakers into action.

The country is horrified by abuses committed using hundreds of millions in tax dollars. According to a recent survey from Data for Progress, 55% of voters think any increased funding for immigration enforcement agencies is a bad use of taxpayer money. New York Times polling released on Friday, meanwhile, found that 61% of people believe ICE’s tactics have “gone too far.”

Voters who watched yet another American protester shot down in the middle of a Minneapolis street are looking to Congress to rein in ICE. And senators currently hold the fate of ICE and Border Patrol funding in their hands.

This week, the Senate is meeting to vote on six government funding bills ahead of a Jan. 30 government shutdown deadline. If Congress now renews the ICE budget with no strings attached, it will become complicit in the violence, violations of rights, and chaos ICE is fomenting every day.

Thankfully, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seems to understand the urgency of this moment. The minority leader vowed on Saturday night to oppose any funding package that includes DHS funding. There can be no business as usual for DHS at a time when it is rampaging through communities, wreaking havoc and inflicting physical and constitutional violence.

Senators have worked hard to negotiate bipartisan compromise spending bills (no easy feat), and they should go ahead and pass the five bills funding other departments. But any bill that would fund ICE and Border Patrol without any meaningful limits is effectively endorsing the conduct of rogue agencies that are causing indelible harm to people across the country, including many U.S. citizens. No senator should want that on their record or their conscience.

ICE is randomly stopping people who appear Black or Brown, including off-duty cops – and demanding they show proof of citizenship. Small business owners who were able to survive the Covid-19 pandemic now worry about how they’ll survive ICE’s Operation Metro Surge, with customers too afraid to leave their homes.

Alex Pretti and Renee Good were shot by federal agents at point blank range. They should both be alive today.

But the shootings weren’t the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, nor the end.

Within 72 hours of Good’s death, over 1,000 protests sprung up across the country. That’s not an aberration. According to at least one survey, a majority of American voters watched the video of her killing. Many, it seems, were horrified. This weekend, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said some 15,000 people braved subzero temperatures to peacefully demand ICE get out of their city.

Last Tuesday, a medical examiner ruled that the death of a 55-year-old man detained at Fort Bliss, Texas – the former Japanese internment camp repurposed as part of ICE’s deportation machine – was a homicide, due to asphyxiation; ICE officials initially called it a suicide.

More from MS NOW Daily

Must reads from Today's list

Just a few days ago, federal agents detained Liam Conejo Ramos – a 5-year-old preschool student – in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. Local school officials claim ICE vehicles are tailing school buses and trying to enter school grounds.

On top of that, a leaked Department of Homeland Security memo showed that the department has been telling ICE agents it’s OK to break down doors and force their way into homes without a judicial warrant. The Fourth Amendment was written to protect us from exactly this: heavily armed government forces invading our property at gunpoint, and on their own say-so.

These agencies are also attacking our First Amendment right to speak out. People who simply videotape agents’ behavior, stand on sidewalks, pray in front of ICE facilities, or watch these masked and armed agents are facing gas and pepper balls, as well as seemingly indiscriminate arrests and physical assault.

Now the Senate has an opportunity to put its foot down. Some will fret about another funding fight after the bruising, record-breaking shutdown in the fall. But this situation is completely different. The question is not whether to use government funding as leverage to accomplish a policy aim. The question is whether the funding Congress is considering for DHS will be used to violate the law, and our rights.

There’s a long list of things Congress should insist on before ICE and Border Patrol get another dime. For example, ICE needs to end warrantless arrests and home invasions without judicial warrants. Border Patrol needs to stop policing our cities. And the administration must turn over all evidence and witnesses related to the killings of Good and Pretti to Minnesota investigators.

Last week, the ACLU’s polling showed that 54% of voters oppose any increased budget for ICE’s enforcement and detention budget. And 65% support Congress holding rogue agencies and officers accountable for constitutional violations, using something like the proposed Bivens Act to do so.

Everywhere ICE goes with its lawless dragnets and wanton violence, communities suffer. Kids stay home from school. Businesses lose employees and customers. Citizens and legal residents are harassed and asked to “show their papers,” arrested, and even locked up because of the color of their skin or their language or their accent. And of course, thousands of people have been terrorized, traumatized, ripped away from their families — and sometimes — tragically killed.

The American people don’t want to live in this kind of police state.

Senators should listen. And then do something about it.","https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769313332/260124-federal-agents-mn-mbs_1159417b56e0_1159417cd550_1159417661d6/260124-federal-agents-mn-mbs_1159417b56e0_1159417cd550_1159417661d6.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1",N,,2026-01-25 22:58:07.890306

On Saturday night, Minnesotans gathered in candlelight vigils on street corners in our neighborhoods to mourn and remember Pretti.","On Friday, hours before Shabbat began, I was arrested with 96 other multifaith clergy members and Faith in Minnesota leaders while protesting ICE in Minneapolis.

“Who could have imagined such times as these?” we sang, in the words of local songmaker Sarina Partridge. “We will grieve through these times, and soon enough we’ll be grieving on the other side.”

We cannot keep on with business as usual when our federal government is engaged in escalating state terror right here, right now. To grieve through these times is not enough; we must also act.

In the bitter cold, thousands of Minnesotans gathered at that airport. Tens of thousands more marched downtown, and others simply stayed home in the largest work stoppage in this country in many decades, the Day of Truth and Freedom. Nearly one thousand interfaith clergy answered the call to come to Minnesota — as they did for the Civil Rights Movement call to march in Selma in 1965 — to join us in the fight.

Standing there among them, on erev shabbes in the cold, I thought about the Torah portion we would read the next morning in shul: parashat Bo, from the Book of Exodus.

In it, the darkness of the ninth plague that befell the Egyptians is described as something that the oppressors — the mitzrim, which I’ll translate as “the ones of narrowed sight” — could actually touch. It was so thick that it kept them isolated from each other, unable to move.

In contrast, the dwellings of those seeking liberation were full of light.

I imagined that palpable darkness not as a punishment, but as a reflection of reality. The oppressors were unwilling to see the humanity of their neighbors. But if they had been, they too could have found themselves in dwellings full of light, able to clearly perceive the richness and possibility of living in a multiethnic community.

So too with the federal oppressors here in Minnesota, and those who collude with them. They are so welcome to join us in the light of that recognition. We were there at the airport to invite them in.

Instead, they arrested nearly 100 of us, while we sang and prayed for the protection of our people in the languages of our diverse traditions. Doing this work in coalition builds the power we need to break through the oppression: Our differences make us stronger.

As a minister next to me chanted the Lord’s Prayer, and a clergy member close by meditated with closed eyes, I chimed in with “Ana Bekoach,” a kabbalistic prayer that is part of Friday night services, envisioning divine protection holding close all the people of this place.

At our airport, Signature Aviation is facilitating the internment of our fellow Minnesotans every day, adults and children alike, flying them to detention centers where they suffer in conditions that deny their humanity. ICE is even disappearing workers at that airport from the jobs they work every day, keeping all of us safe and supported as we travel.

The airport is supposed to encourage connection. Come join us in our city, it is supposed to say; come see the beauty of our communities. Come, with your eyes open, to join a dwelling of light. Instead, it has turned into a hub of darkness, and separation.

As Jews, so many aspects of our history are particularly resonant in this moment.

As ICE has engaged in a campaign of terror in our city since the start of the year, I have heard Jews in my community reflecting on their families’ experiences with state terror in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and under dictatorships in Latin America. We join neighbors, refugees and immigrants from around the world, who never thought those feelings of suffocating fear would again define their lives here in the United States.

Now that they are, our obligation is to resist.

I was moved to tears during a march last week, when I saw families in hiding peeking out from behind their attic blinds as we sang of our love for our immigrant neighbors. It reminded me of Jewish families reduced to hiding in Nazi Germany, and of those brave souls who tried to protect them.

When I was arrested, I felt my heart open to the clergy standing and kneeling together with me, and all those in our state who have stood up with courage and generosity throughout these weeks and months. I hoped that all those who would see or hear of our arrest would be motivated to join this work.

The safety of all marginalized communities in this country, our Jewish community included, depends on our efforts to protect our democratic practices, and one another. You can join us, in Minnesota, or wherever you are.

Call for ICE to get out of Minnesota. Their presence is endangering us all. Just yesterday, Alex Jeffrey Pretti — an ICU nurse, mountain bike enthusiast, dog lover and beloved community member — was shot and killed by federal agents while attempting to aid a fellow protester. Our government, rather than accept responsibility for the injustice of his death, and that of Renée Nicole Good, is already lying about who these upstanding Minnesotans were and what those agents did.

Learn from us and protect each other in your home communities. You can stand with Minnesota; we’ll stand with you too. Call your senators to demand that they deny ICE funding in an upcoming vote this week. Push for prosecution of ICE agents who kill our civilians. Together we will fight the plague of narrow sight, instead creating dwellings of warm light where we hold and honor the fullness of humanity of each and every one of us.

On Saturday night, Minnesotans gathered in candlelight vigils on street corners in our neighborhoods to mourn and remember Pretti. I was with hundreds of my students on campus. We imagined, together, all the vigil-goers, holding candles to decry Pretti’s death and honor his memory, as points of light, linked across Minnesota and the country, and around the world.",https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-minneapolis-clergy-protest-airport-rabbi-arrested-GettyImages-2257689256.jpg?_t=1769384216,N,,2026-01-25 19:57:30.967811

The impromptu march that the organization Hands Off and the New York Immigration Coalition called on Jan. 24 was sparked by several gruesome viral videos that showed multiple masked federal agents in Minneapolis shooting protester Alex Pretti multiple times. Pretti, an ICU nurse, had come to the aid of a woman whom agents knocked down before ICE members turned their attention to him — wrestling him to the ground and pummeling him with their fists.

One of the agents then grabbed what appeared to be a holster with a gun from Pretti’s waist; multiple reports indicated that he had a license to carry the weapon in Minnesota. After the gun was taken, multiple ICE agents fired shots at Pretti, killing him.

The videos contradicted multiple narratives from the Department of Homeland Security, its secretary, Kristi Noem, and others who claimed that Pretti had confronted them first with a gun and threatened the agents’ lives.

However, the released videos do not appear to show Pretti holding a firearm; instead, the weapon appears to be concealed in his waistband. Local police say Pretti has no criminal history aside from traffic violations and did have a permit for the weapon, as required by state law.

Meanwhile, in the Big Apple, elected officials denounced the slaying. Mayor Zohran Mamdani wasted little time in again calling for the dismantling of the immigration enforcement agency.

“As tens of thousands across America protest the violence that ICE sows with impunity, federal agents shot and killed another person in Minneapolis today. ICE terrorizes our cities. ICE puts us all in danger. Abolish ICE,” Mamdani wrote on X.

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also took to social media to demand fellow elected officials vote to cut funding to ICE.

“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny.DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence. They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Immigration rights advocates, like the Immigration Coalition and Hands Off NYC, called an emergency protest in Union Square on Saturday to stand in solidarity with Minneapolis and to demand that ICE be withdrawn from the state and that operations in New York cease.

“This is not normal — no one should be killed for protecting their neighbors. No one should be killed for standing up to masked agents who are abducting people off the streets. ICE’s killing of another Minneapolis observer makes it clear: when masked, armed agents are unleashed on communities with no accountability, people die,” a statement released by Hands Off NYC read.

Minneapolis, MN — National Immigration Project Executive Director Sirine Shebaya issued the following statement on the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minnesota:

Over the weekend in Minneapolis, federal immigration enforcement officers publicly executed a peaceful observer. We mourn the senseless killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who worked at a Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, gunned down by a U.S. Border Patrol agent. This marks the second fatal federal shooting in Minneapolis in less than three weeks.

When federal officers repeatedly kill people on our streets, it is not a failure of policy; it is the policy. This is a system that has abandoned human life, constitutional limits, and basic accountability. With a $170 billion military-style budget, Congress has enabled a massive federal enforcement operation that uses taxpayer dollars to inflict brutality on the American people and treats constitutional rights as a nuisance, not protections.

The National Immigration Project calls for:

ICE operations to end everywhere;

Full legal accountability for any use of force by federal immigration officers;

No funding for ICE or other Department of Homeland Security agencies;

An end to warrantless arrests and arrests based on racial profiling;

A transparent, independent investigation into ICE and Border Patrol for human rights and Constitutional violations.",https://nipnlg.org/themes/radicati_drupal/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-26 01:57:48.473088

We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day.
Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors.","This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

On Thursday, I ended my day on daycare patrol as the windchill crept close to 25 degrees below zero. The patrols began after ICE appeared at my son’s daycare two weeks ago; that same day, a daycare worker for the same provider was taken by agents at a nearby location while trying to get in to work. During my recent patrol, ICE agents were spotted in the neighborhood, as they nearly always are, but everybody made it out of the building safely.

As I write this, a helicopter is circling over my neighborhood, as happens most days now. My phone is pinging near constantly with alerts from Signal groups that exist to defend and support our community. A friend texted to ask how concerned we should be that the president will invoke the Insurrection Act and send the military into our city; my husband just learned that workers at a nearby small business were taken by the government; a friend’s school went on lockdown today because ICE was nearby.

Our neighborhood has never been more united, but you wouldn’t know it from how few people are out on the streets. Nobody opens their door anymore, knowing that the next knock might be a federal agent demanding to know where the Brown people live in your neighborhood. People are making a point to support immigrant-owned restaurants, but you have to check if they’re open before you go, because so many aren’t. Folks are out delivering food and essentials to neighbors who are unable to leave their homes for fear, but they have to be careful to use a different car than they drive when they’re observing ICE, because the government is tracking license plates.

Earlier this week, students in our city lost two days of learning because schools closed—the teachers needed time to shift to the virtual learning model which began on Thursday. This time, it’s not because of an unknown and deadly illness; it’s because the government is attacking our students. People are being shipped out of the state so fast that their families don’t have time to get to their holding cell with the paperwork proving they’re legally authorized to be here before they’re gone.

The horrors have not ceased since Renee Good’s death, instead they have increased. Protestors are being attacked and shot. On Tuesday, a five-year-old was detained by ICE and used to bait his family into leaving their home. The preschooler and his father have now been sent to Texas, and it is unclear if or when they’ll return. On Thursday, multiple civil rights leaders, including Saint Paul Public School board member Chauntyll Allen, were arrested for exercising their First Amendment right to protest, in a DOJ action that the NAACP has said was a likely violation of First Amendment rights. And on Saturday, Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents, shot multiple times at close range. Every day, there is a new horror to process, a new way in which the federal government inflicts irreparable harm on our community.

I serve as a Saint Paul City Councilmember, and our community is under a violent attack at the hands of the federal government. And so we are fighting back in all the ways we know how.

On January 12th, Saint Paul announced a joint lawsuit with the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota against the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to end this unconstitutional operation. Our City Council is working to strengthen our separation ordinance and develop other legal tools to make certain that our city resources—including our police department—cannot and will not support the work of immigration enforcement. We are calling on the governor to declare a state of emergency and enact a state-wide eviction moratorium to ensure that nobody loses their home because the federal government is making it impossible for them to earn a living. Every elected official in our city is working to connect our residents with whatever support they need right now. We are also demanding that Congress act—that our representatives and senators use every tool at their disposal to end this occupation—because neither cities nor states alone have enough tools to protect our people from the federal government.

None of this feels like enough. Individually, none of it is. But what we know from other countries that have successfully defeated authoritarianism is that democratic resurgence is possible. Over the last 30 years, 52 percent of “autocratization episodes” were followed by democratic resurgence. In 90 percent of those cases, countries were ultimately as or more democratic than they were previously.

In Saint Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win. We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day. We are demonstrating our commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of incredible levels of violence being used against us. We might get tired, but we are not succumbing to despair. Our civil resistance movement is strong, and it is growing.

Most importantly, we know what we’re fighting for, because we’ve already lived it. Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors. Minnesota has always been at its best when we’ve built structures that allow everybody in our state to flourish, whether they’ve been here for months or for generations. This is a place where we take seriously Paul Wellstone’s immortal words that “we all do better when we all do better.” The cruel, painful world that Donald Trump is trying to force on us is not one that we will ever, ever settle for. The path ahead is not clear, but we will continue to put one foot in front of the other until the day we win.",https://compote.slate.com/images/e0fbca6f-121d-4eeb-9e26-545a0e2c0315.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:49.120156

Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital, was shot multiple times by ICE agents during an anti-immigration operation on Saturday.

NNU, representing over 225,000 members, expressed outrage, stating, “The nation’s nurses are horrified that immigration agents have committed cold-blooded murder against a public servant who posed no threat. We demand justice and accountability for his murder.”

The incident marks the third shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis this month, following the deaths of Renee Good and another individual during arrests.

On January 7, 37-year-old US citizen Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent. Another ICE agent, on January 14, shot a Venezuelan national in the leg during arrest.

NNU criticized the Trump administration’s crackdown, declaring that ICE poses a serious public health threat. They emphasized that ICE agents have repeatedly shown violence, stating, “They have kidnapped hardworking people and now murdered a trusted nurse.”

The American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Minnesota Organization of Registered Nurses (MNORN) also issued statements expressing sorrow and demanding transparency in the investigation.

We are “deeply disturbed and saddened to learn of the death of Alex Pretti, a registered nurse, in Minneapolis earlier today. We extend our condolences to Alex’s loved ones, colleagues, and the community at large,"" ANA said in a statement.

ANA added that it condemned violence and demanded accountability and transparency in investigating and determining the cause of the incident.

""The seriousness of this incident and others demands transparency and accountability. ANA calls for a full, unencumbered investigation, and urges that findings be shared promptly and clearly so Alex’s loved ones and the public have answers,” it emphasized in its statement.

Meanwhile, MNORN expressed heartfelt grief over the loss.

""Today, our nursing community is grieving. We have lost a fellow registered nurse to an act of violence connected to immigration enforcement. Regardless of where each of us stands on the issues surrounding this moment, the loss of a nurse, a caregiver, a colleague, a human being cuts us deeply. This message is not about politics. It is about mourning a life taken too soon and honoring the calling we all share,"" MNORN stated,

""Please be gentle with yourselves and with one another in the days ahead. Check in on each other. Allow room for sorrow, confusion, and reflection. If you are struggling, please reach out, no one needs or should carry this alone…When one nurse is lost, all of us feel it,"" MNORN added.

Pretti’s family condemns accusations

Pretti’s family condemned accusations labeling him a ""domestic terrorist,"" asserting he was unarmed during the incident. They described him as a compassionate individual deeply concerned for others.

Pretti’s family said they are ""heartbroken but also very angry"" over the agent's killing of Alex, a Democratic voter who had taken part in woke protests.

Alex's father, Michael Pretti, told AP that Alex viewed participating in protests as a way to express his care for others. His parents described him as a compassionate person, “deeply concerned about people.”

His parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful. ""We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,"" Alex told his father.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed the shooting occurred during a targeted operation against an armed individual, asserting that an agent fired in self-defense.

Protests erupted in Minneapolis on Saturday, calling for justice and opposing federal enforcement actions, prompting Governor Tim Walz to activate the Minnesota National Guard for local law enforcement support.

Protesters gathered near the location of the latest shooting, and tensions rose in parts of the city. Federal agents used crowd-control measures, including tear gas and flash bangs, after confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement personnel.

Governor Walz authorized the activation of the Minnesota National Guard to assist local law enforcement at the request of the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office.

Walz said he had communicated with the White House, stressing that the investigation should be led by the state.

""The state has the personnel to keep people safe -- federal agents must not obstruct our ability to do so,"" Walz said on X.",https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2026/1/25/85d40adb-c874-4beb-961c-534d9ab9effb.JPG,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:45.214447

Local officials have disputed administration officials' claims that the shootings were acts of self-defense, citing bystander video that appears to contradict the government’s accounts.

Here is a look at the potential legal repercussions for the officers.

WHAT HAPPENED?

An ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good in her car on January 7. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer had fired ""defensive shots"" after Good attempted to run him over, though online videos of the shooting verified by Reuters cast doubt on the government's narrative.

ICE agents shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in a separate incident on January 24. DHS said Pretti approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, though bystander videos verified by Reuters show Pretti - whom Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said carried a handgun lawfully - holding a phone as he tries to help protesters whom agents pushed to the ground.

WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?

Minnesota’s use-of-force law permits state police to use deadly force only if reasonable officers would believe doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, from death or serious harm.

Federal law has a similar standard, permitting use of deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury.

COULD THE OFFICERS BE PROSECUTED?

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties. Immunity only applies when an officer's actions were authorized under federal law and were necessary and proper.

If Minnesota charged the agents, they could seek to move the case to federal court and argue they are immune from prosecution. To prevail, the state would have to show their actions were outside of their official duties or were objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful. If a judge ruled an officer was immune, the case would be dismissed and the state would not be able to charge him again.

COULD FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGE THE OFFICERS?

Federal prosecutors can charge law enforcement officers for fatal shootings, but the bar is very high and charges are rare. Prosecutors would need to show an officer knew his conduct was unlawful or acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional limits of his authority, which is difficult to prove in court. The Trump administration has so far defended the officers' actions.

WHAT DEFENSES WOULD THE ICE AGENTS HAVE?

In addition to federal immunity, the agents could argue that their actions were reasonable under the Constitution, that they acted in self-defense or that they did not act with intent to harm or kill the victims.

COULD THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES SUE FOR CIVIL DAMAGES?

Federal officers are immune from civil lawsuits unless their conduct clearly violated a clearly established constitutional right. This legal standard, known as qualified immunity, has become a highly effective tool for shielding police officers accused of using excessive force, a series of Reuters investigative stories found in 2020.

However, victims can also sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work. This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity that usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In an FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully. The statute would allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

But while the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.

The crisis response from President Trump’s top Homeland Security officials followed a familiar playbook from an administration eager to project grit and resolve, particularly on immigration, in the face of inconvenient facts. Despite their efforts, damage from the incident continued to reverberate Sunday, creating political jeopardy for the president.

Videos that emerged of Pretti’s killing enraged the public. Government lines justifying the use of lethal force prompted blowback among staunch Republican supporters and conservative groups. Negotiations in Congress to thwart another shutdown were upended over Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding. And a Trump-appointed judge blocked the administration from attempting to destroy evidence in the case, lending weight to fears of a cover-up.

It is new terrain for Trump, whose handling of immigration had been a rare bright spot in polling of his job performance throughout his first year back in office. Now, for the first time, surveys show a plurality of Americans disapprove of the administration’s enforcement tactics, with 1 in 3 Republicans expressing concern they have grown too harsh.

Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at a hospital for veterans in Minneapolis, was shot 10 times at close range by ICE agents. Multiple videos of the incident appear to show Pretti attempting to aid a fellow civilian who had been pushed by an ICE officer, before he himself was wrestled to the ground by agents.

He had been carrying a firearm that Minneapolis police said was lawfully purchased and registered. The videos that circulated on social media do not indicate that he had brandished, or was attempting to reach for, his weapon, despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accusing Pretti of attending the protest with the aim of committing violence.

Bill Essayli, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, warned that approaching law enforcement while armed created “a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.” But the administration’s decision to blame Pretti’s death on his decision to bear arms drew harsh rebuke from 2nd Amendment advocates across the Republican Party.

“Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the National Rifle Assn. said in a statement.

Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, accused Noem and Greg Bovino, Trump’s head of the U.S. Border Patrol, of making matters “far worse by being unrestrained in how they proceed.”

“The President is a great marketer and PR guy,” Erickson wrote on X. “While those around him may not realize it, I’m pretty sure he understands another dead American with his team rushing to undermine second amendment arguments and define the dead guy with a lot of facts still unknown is a bad look.”

John Mitnick, the general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term, said he was “enraged and embarrassed” by the agency’s “lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty,” and called for the president’s impeachment and removal.

“People have had enough,” Brian O’Hara, Minneapolis’ police chief, told CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year, last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn’t shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that’s been killed, it’s the third shooting within three weeks.”

This month, Renee Nicole Good, also 37 and a mother of three, was fatally shot by an ICE agent while in her car, shortly after dropping her son off at school. As in Pretti’s case, Noem and other senior administration officials justified the incident within hours of her death by impugning the victim’s motives without producing substantive evidence.

The aggressive response comes as the administration has faced accusations of misrepresenting other facts to the public.

After the president confused Greenland with the separate island nation of Iceland four times in a speech last week in Switzerland, Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, flatly denied he had made the mix-up.

And on the same trip, Trump dismissed the role of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in the war in Afghanistan — where partner nations lost more than 1,000 soldiers over the course of the conflict — falsely claiming they “stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.” The remark has infuriated some of Washington’s closest allies.

Only when Noem was questioned by a conservative reporter on Fox News about the circumstances of Pretti’s death did she suggest error may have been at fault.

“This happened in seconds,” Noem said, asked whether Pretti had been shot and killed after being disarmed of a weapon he hadn’t brandished in the first place. “They clearly feared for their lives and took action to defend themselves.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e9c3a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3469x1821+0+246/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fca%2F032e55a947deb8c41b50956ac284%2Fap26025583749400.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 17:59:46.440833

The latest shooting has also sparked a legal fight over control of the investigation and renewed calls by state and city officials for an end to the immigration surge that has swept across Minneapolis and surrounding cities.

Federal officials said agents were acting in self-defence by opening fire on Saturday morning, local time, when Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse, stepped into a confrontation between an immigration officer and a woman on the street.

Officials said Mr Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Mr Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.

Mr Pretti's family said they were ""heartbroken but also very angry"" at authorities, saying in a statement that Mr Pretti was a kind-hearted person who wanted to make a difference in the world.

Former US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama put out a statement saying Mr Pretti's death was a ""heartbreaking tragedy"".

""It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,"" they said.

""For weeks now, people across the country have been rightly outraged by the spectacle of masked ICE recruits and other federal agents acting with impunity and engaging in tactics that seem designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city.

""These unprecedented tactics — which even the former top lawyer of the Department of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration has characterised as embarrassing, lawless and cruel — have now resulted in the fatal shootings of two US citizens.

A federal judge has already issued an order blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to the shooting, after state and county officials sued.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the lawsuit filed on Saturday is meant to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect. A court hearing is scheduled for Monday in federal court in St Paul.

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which are named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from the Associated Press.

Another federal judge previously ruled that officers participating in the federal immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, though an appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling days before Saturday's shooting.

The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Governor Tim Walz, officials said, with troops sent to both the shooting site and a federal building where officers have squared off daily with demonstrators.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Mr Pretti showed up to ""impede a law enforcement operation"".

She questioned why he was armed but did not offer details about whether Mr Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.

But gun rights groups have noted it is legal to carry firearms during protests.

""Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers or exercising their First Amendment rights,"" the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement.

""These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.""

Trump blames Democrats

The president weighed in on social media by lashing out at Mr Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.

He shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: ""What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?""

Mr Trump said the Democratic governor and mayor ""are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric"".

US House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among several Democratic politicians demanding that federal immigration authorities leave Minnesota.

She also urged Democrats to refuse to vote to fund US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying via social media: ""We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer later said that Democrats would not vote for a spending package that included money for DHS, which oversees ICE.

Senator Schumer's statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down January 30 when funding runs out.

Mr Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an ICE officer killed 37-year-old Renee Good on January 7, sparking widespread protests.

Mr Pretti's family was furious at federal officials' description of the shooting.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,"" the family statement said.

""Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.

""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

Video shows officers, man who was shot

When the Saturday confrontation began, bystander video shows protesters blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on a commercial street in south Minneapolis.

The videos show Mr Pretti stepping in after an immigration officer shoves a woman.

Mr Pretti appears to be holding his phone toward the officer, but there's no sign he is holding a weapon.

The officer shoves Mr Pretti in his chest, and pepper sprays him and the woman.

Soon, at least seven officers are forcing Mr Pretti to the ground. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. An officer holding a canister strikes him near his head several times.

A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it is not clear where it came from. Multiple officers back off. More shots are heard. Officers back away, and the man lies motionless on the street.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander leading Mr Trump's crackdown, was repeatedly pressed on CNN's Sunday State of the Union for evidence that Mr Pretti did anything illegal or assaulted law enforcement, as officials have claimed.

Mr Bovino said it was ""very evident"" that Mr Pretti was not following the the officers' orders.

""It's too bad the consequences had to be paid because he injected himself into that crime scene,"" he said.

""He made the decision.""

Mr Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and the state would lead the investigation into the shooting.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

Protests continue

Demonstrations broke out in several cities across the country, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles.

In Minneapolis, protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather with temperatures around -21 degrees Celsius.

An angry crowd gathered after the shooting and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them ""cowards"" and telling them to go home.

Protesters dragged garbage bins from alleyways to block streets, and people chanted ""ICE out now"" and ""Observing ICE is not a crime"".

As darkness fell, hundreds of people mourned quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting.

A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.

Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration.

""It feels like every day something crazier happens,"" he said.

""What's happening in our community is wrong, it's sickening, it's disgusting.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4d3922968675aabc27111eefcb76d5db?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1687&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=157&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:57.523431

ICE is tasked with enforcing the nation's immigration laws in the interior of the country, while Border Patrol officers do so near border crossings and ports of entry.

But under the second Trump administration, those distinctions have become murky as the two agencies have undergone sweeping changes – and increasingly work alongside one another – to boost President's Donald Trump's wide-reaching deportation campaign.

Border Patrol, which is typically constrained to a 100-mile zone near any U.S. border, began deploying into the interior of the country, leading some of the most intense and visible enforcement operations in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, for example. They've assisted helping ICE agents conducting immigration stops across the country, including in Minneapolis.

ICE, meanwhile, has seen a more than doubling of its workforce after receiving a historic funding boost through Trump's massive tax and spending legislation, which he dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" With $84 billion at its disposal, ICE has become the nation's most well-funded law enforcement agency, over the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The agency has become the face of the nation's immigration enforcement in many respects, with protesters organizing ""ICE Out"" demonstrations nationwide and polls showing Americans becoming less favorable of its tactics.

The ongoing federal immigration operation in Minneapolis, which has prompted intensifying protests after federal officers shot and killed two people in less than a month, involves 3,000 agents from Border Patrol and ICE. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, described it as the largest immigration operation ever.

Can Border Patrol and ICE conduct arrests and searches?

Border Patrol agents can make stops, arrests and search vehicles, particularly within 100 miles of border crossings and ports of entry, the agency says. In that 100-mile zone, Border Patrol agents have broad authority to interrogate people and conduct warrantless searches when there's ""reasonable suspicion"" of immigration violations.

ICE says its agents can ""briefly detain"" people who they have ""reasonable suspicion"" of being in the country illegally. The agency also says its agents can ""arrest people they believe are illegal aliens"" and ""initiate consensual encounters and speak with people"" on the street.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that cleared the way for ICE to use race, accents and places of work as factors in deciding who to stop and potentially detain. Since the ruling, state and local officials, protesters and even police chiefs have accused immigration enforcement agents of engaging in racial profiling.

ICE is also facing scrutiny over its assertion that federal officers can forcibly enter homes without a warrant signed by a judge – a move constitutional scholars, immigration experts and a federal judge say is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment.

How to tell ICE and Border Patrol agents apart

Many federal immigration agents involved in the latest high-profile operations have worn masks, balaclavas, hats and sunglasses, with no personal identifiers, unlike local police who often have visible badge numbers.

Many have also refused to identify themselves or the particular agency they're with, which has fueled confusion among civilians and local law enforcement alike.

Border Patrol agents often dress in dark green colors or camouflage, and they often identify their agency with vests reading ""U.S. Border Patrol"" or with patches on their sleeves. Some agents in U.S. cities are a part of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, a team specialized in high-risk operations like counterterrorism and hostage rescue. These agents have been seen wearing vests that say ""BORTAC.""

ICE agents, meanwhile, have been known to wear vests reading ""Police ICE"" or ""HSI,"" which is a reference to Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of ICE that handles federal criminal probes. ICE agents have also been seen dressed in plainclothes, sometimes with a visible badge reading ""ICE."" Many of the street operations are conducted with unmarked cars.

David Harvey quit on Friday but Richie Taylor, Mayes’ spokesperson, has not confirmed whether Harvey’s resignation was directly due to the attorney general’s rhetoric on a 12News interview from Tuesday, according to azcentral.com’s Stacey Barchenger.

Taylor did say that Mayes “was articulating a very deep concern she has about the possibility for these situations to spin out of control and end in tragedy,” as Minneapolis has recently experienced a pair of deadly shootings involving federal agents.

Mayes has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2022.

What did Attorney General Kris Mayes say about ICE, Stand Your Ground law?

The controversy began when Mayes expressed concerns that confrontations between Arizona residents and ICE could turn deadly in an interview with 12News. She called the combination of armed residents who are empowered under the law to defend themselves and mask-wearing agents without uniforms “a recipe for disaster.”

Brahm Resnik, the journalist conducting the interview, asked her to clarify if she was “giving license to a person to shoot an officer.”

“Absolutely not. But how do you know they’re a peace officer? That’s the key,” Mayes said. “And so if there’s a situation where somebody pulls out their gun, because they know Arizona is a Stand Your Ground state, then it becomes, did they reasonably know that they were a peace officer? You know? I mean, this is a different set of circumstances in the state of Arizona.”

Mayes also vowed in the interview to prosecute any ICE agent who violates Arizona law, although federal immunity law makes that more complicated to bring to fruition.

Mayes talked further about the issue Thursday during an interview with KTAR News 92.3 FM’s Outspoken. She explained that under Arizona law, residents who reasonably believe their lives are in danger can use lethal force to protect themselves.

“If you are really sure that they are ICE and they present a badge or they present identification, then I would not recommend using lethal force against them. But one of the worries that I have is … that we have a Stand Your Ground law in Arizona,” she said.

Joe Clure, executive director of the Arizona Police Association, responded to the attorney general’s comments Friday on KTAR News, calling them “reckless” and “dangerous.”

“I was in complete shock when I heard the … highest law enforcement official in the state of Arizona essentially giving a tutorial on how to shoot a police officer, specifically ICE agents, and get away with it,” Clure said.

Clure also accused Mayes of misinterpreting Arizona’s Stand Your Ground law because it doesn’t allow for lethal force against law enforcement officers performing official duties.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of two Americans being killed at the hands of Trump’s lawless and out of control Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Congresswoman Haley Stevens (D-MI) announced she will cosponsor H.R. 7163(link is external), a proposal to divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund to state and local law enforcement agencies.

“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control—this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” said Michigan Congresswoman Haley Stevens. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”

H.R. 7163 would help hire and train 200,000 local police officers nationwide, investing in proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.

The bill would move the additional funding granted to ICE in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to local law enforcement agencies, leaving the agency with historically normal funding levels to conduct traditional immigration enforcement operations.

It would reallocate $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions).

It would reallocate $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens has been leading the fight to hold ICE accountable in Congress and to rein in Donald Trump’s repeated abuses of power during his Administration.

Last week, Stevens voted against(link is external) the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, refusing to fund ICE’s operations without major reforms or accountability measures.

Last year, Stevens cosponsored the VISIBLE Act(link is external) to prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities.

Stevens joined over 150 of her colleagues in demanding(link is external) ICE end its surge of officers in Minnesota and conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent.

Stevens and her Michigan colleague, Rep. Hillary Scholten, demanded an investigation(link is external) into the death of Nenko Gantchev, an individual who died in ICE custody in Baldwin, Michigan.

Following a lack of accountability or answers related to Gantchev’s death and the death of Renee Nicole Good, Stevens called for the immediate removal(link is external) of Secretary Kristi Noem and cosponsored an effort to impeach her in the House of Representatives.

Stevens voted against(link is external) the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gave ICE its nearly $75 billion windfall.

Stevens introduced the Stop Trump’s Abuse of Power Act(link is external), legislation to prevent the President from deploying the military against Americans without express consent from state officials, an authoritarian tactic this President has used repeatedly to fuel fear and intimidation during aggressive ICE crackdowns.

Stevens voted against(link is external) the Laken Riley Act, which would sweep thousands of people into jails and detention centers at enormous taxpayer expense while diverting key law enforcement resources and potentially violating civil liberties.

Stevens has repeatedly voted and spoken out against unconstitutional efforts to demonize immigrants and subject them to racial profiling and gross violations of their basic rights.

Senate Democrats are expected to have an all-members call on Sunday evening to figure out the plan forward, one aide told The Hill.
… But I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told “Face The Nation” on Sunday.
We’ve already passed six funding bills.
“There is no way Senate Democrats can approve funding for an agency that is killing innocent Americans in the streets.","A second high-profile killing by a federal agent in Minneapolis has jeopardized the chances of Congress averting a partial government shutdown as Democrats come out en masse against the funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Lawmakers had been on the verge of completing their funding work for fiscal 2026 this week after the House last week passed its final four appropriations bills. However, the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, 37, a nurse at the city’s Veterans Affairs hospital, by a Border Patrol agent has seemingly torpedoed the chances of those bills passing the Senate, with one key Democrat after another saying they will not vote to fund DHS.

The DHS bill is tied in with five others that fund the departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education — all of which have broad support.

Democrats are now saying they will not support the so-called minibus as long as the DHS portion is included. Senate Democrats are expected to have an all-members call on Sunday evening to figure out the plan forward, one aide told The Hill.

“I hate shutdowns. … But I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told “Face The Nation” on Sunday. “Take up DHS by itself. Let’s have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what’s going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don’t have to have a shutdown.”

The Maine independent’s comments came a day after multiple key Democrats indicated they will vote against any funding package that includes the DHS segment.

Among them were Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who said that he was against it Friday morning before the latest shooting. All four were among the eight Democrats who voted to end the 43-day government shutdown in November. King was also part of that group.

“The Trump Administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability. They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement,” Cortez Masto said in a statement, after previously pitching her colleagues on a fix that would not require a shutdown. “This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

“I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,” she said. “We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget. We’ve already passed six funding bills. Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe.”

Adding to the chorus was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who announced on Saturday that Democrats “will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill” with the DHS bill included.

The latest calls from the minority party mark a moment of whiplash.

Democrats were furious in recent weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, amid the protests in the Twin Cities. Almost all House Democrats voted against a stand-alone DHS bill last week, but lawmakers and Capitol Hill sources were still hopeful as recently as Friday that the “minibus” would stay on track.

One former senior Senate Democratic aide had told The Hill on Friday that the chances of a shutdown were roughly 25 percent as Democrats had been hearing from constituents about ICE actions in their home states and were under pressure to act.

Now, it’s tough to see how the measure moves on.

“90 percent [chance of a] shutdown,” the former aide said Sunday morning. “There is no way Senate Democrats can approve funding for an agency that is killing innocent Americans in the streets. It’s the only lever of power they have left to show the American people they are standing up to Trump and ICE.”

The killing of Pretti has also spawned another clash between federal and state agencies. Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of President Trump’s Border Patrol operations, blamed Pretti for the incident — an account that has come under major skepticism from statewide officials.

Up until recently, Democrats had also been skittish about careening into another shutdown, having felt the aftershocks from the longest shutdown in history last fall, which came over their insistence on extending the enhanced ObamaCare subsidies.

Both sides had hailed the bipartisan work to clear the funding decks for 2026. Schumer earlier in the month had insisted that lawmakers were not heading toward a shutdown during a Sunday show appearance, with appropriators being pleased at the progress.

However, they all acknowledged the DHS measure was a particularly difficult one for them to get their arms around from the get-go.

We can trust the American people with the truth.” The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis.","The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.

Mere hours after Mr. Pretti died, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, declared without offering evidence that Mr. Pretti had “committed an act of domestic terrorism.” Gregory Bovino, a border patrol official, offered his own assessment: “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

These unfounded and inflammatory judgments pre-empt the outcome of an investigation, which the Department of Homeland Security has promised. They also appear wholly inconsistent with several videos recorded at the scene.

Those videos showed that Mr. Pretti had nothing but a phone in his hands when he was tackled by border patrol agents, and that he never drew the gun he was carrying (and reportedly had a license to carry). Indeed, the videos seem to show that one federal agent took the gun from Mr. Pretti moments before a different agent shot him from behind. Separate analyses by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, CBS News and other organizations all concluded that the videos contradict the Trump administration’s description of the killing.

The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears. Ms. Noem and Mr. Bovino are lying in defiance of obvious truths. They are lying in the manner of authoritarian regimes that require people to accept lies as a demonstration of power.

Even worse is that all of this feels so terribly familiar. Earlier this month, a federal agent shot and killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. In that case, too, the Trump administration has demonized the victim and has blocked a state investigation of the killing.

Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.

The temperature in Minneapolis is dangerously high. There is an urgent need for the federal agents deployed to the city to step back and take a breath before more Americans are hurt or killed. Those protesting the Trump administration have an equal obligation to avoid violence.

The American people also need answers about whether federal agents acted inappropriately, and the behavior of the Trump administration means that it will be impossible to trust any federal investigation that it conducts. President Trump and his appointees have demonstrated themselves to be unconcerned with truth and willing to lie to serve their own interests. Congress therefore must step in. The Constitution vests it with the power to hold hearings, issue subpoenas and demand answers.

Congress ought to investigate both the circumstances of the recent killings in Minneapolis and the broader conduct of the federal agencies engaged in Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown, including their treatment of peaceful protesters. The video evidence shows that the incident that ended in Mr. Pretti’s death began when a federal agent lunged at a protester and knocked her to the ground. There are many similar videos and documented instances of federal agents using unnecessary violence against people who are peacefully protesting or documenting events — both behaviors protected under the First Amendment.

Congress has the power to hold the administration accountable through its control of federal spending. A pending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security offers a crucial opportunity to perform scrutiny and impose necessary guardrails, such as funding for body cameras.

The federal government also has sought to prevent investigations by the state of Minnesota. This must end. A federal judge in Minnesota issued a temporary restraining order on Saturday evening, at the behest of the state, barring federal agencies from destroying evidence related to Mr. Pretti’s killing. The need for such an order is both evident and extraordinary.

“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican increasingly at odds with Mr. Trump, posted on social media on Saturday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”

The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis. It is a disgrace that the first public comment by Mr. Trump in the wake of Mr. Pretti’s death was to post a picture on social media of what he described as “the gunman’s gun.” Stephen Miller, arguably Mr. Trump’s most influential adviser, wrote on social media, without offering evidence, that Mr. Pretti was “an assassin.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/opinion/25ICE-editorial-image/25ICE-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:57:54.374412

While the weakening resolve was far from a full break with Trump, it signals growing unease with the administration’s aggressive actions as Democrats threaten another government shutdown and November’s midterm elections come into view. Until now, Republicans have backed Trump as he deploys federal agents and National Guard to US cities.

Hundreds of videos have shown the agents using pepper spray, shoving, punching and kicking protesters who have stayed largely peaceful and are recording the agents’ actions. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a nurse at a VA hospital, while he was subdued and on his knees after they discovered a gun he had a permit to carry.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, suggested on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures that Trump should consider going “to another city and then maybe let the people of Minneapolis decide” how to proceed on immigration. He also defended immigration agents.

New York Republican Andrew Garbarino, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, has requested public testimony from top immigration officials, telling them in a letter Saturday that Congress “has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Other Republicans who have previously broken with Trump on other matters — including retiring Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Thomas Massie — were more frank.

“There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on X.

Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, also called in post on X for an investigation “both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system.”

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said on CNN’s State of the Union that the agents involved in Pretti’s killing were “most likely” being placed on administrative leave and sent from Minneapolis.

Another Senate Republican, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also broke sharply from the White House’s messaging and demanded “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis “incredibly disturbing” and said the credibility of ICE and Homeland Security are at stake.

“We can trust the American people with the truth,” Cassidy said.

But silence from other leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, suggest that many in the party are still weighing how to respond to Pretti’s killing.

Shutdown Threat

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer vowed late Saturday to block a massive spending package next week unless Republicans strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security, dramatically increasing the risk for a partial US government shutdown.

Democratic opposition to the funding package potentially affects not just Homeland Security but also the departments of Defense, Labor, Education, State, Treasury and Health and Human Services.

None of the Republicans speaking on Sunday mentioned the looming shutdown fight.

The effects of another shutdown would be widespread, including possibly delaying the next Bureau of Labor Statistics report.

In the event of a shutdown, many essential workers — including the military and Transportation Security Administration agents — may have to work without pay. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol employees would likely be paid through additional funding in Trump’s tax bill signed last year.

The House passed the spending bill Thursday and left Washington until after the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.

With the White House calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and accusing him of impeding the work of Border Patrol, despite video evidence to the contrary, Senate Republican leaders will be under enormous pressure to protect DHS funding.

The spending legislation needs votes from at least seven Democrats to pass the Senate.

Several moderates in the party quickly announced Saturday they’d oppose the bill. .

At least one other American, Renee Good, was killed by an ICE agent when he stopped her for partly blocking a street with her car, claiming she tried to run him over.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE.”

Forcing a shutdown risks hard-fought Democratic victories in the spending deal, including reversing many Trump cuts to medical research, foreign aid, education grants and mass transit.

The situation in Minnesota, however, has alienated key Democratic senators.

Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, each of whom voted to end the last shutdown, said in statements Saturday they would oppose funding for Homeland Security without changes. Rosen insisted she will oppose funding “until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said the resistance isn’t about his party or politics.

“It’s about our country and our Congress, and what we need to do to impose some safeguards on an out-of-control agency which is imbued with a culture of lawlessness and seems to be committing murder in Minneapolis,” Blumenthal said.

Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, called Pretti’s killing a “heartbreaking tragedy.”

“It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,” they said in a statement.

Delays Ahead

The Senate, a slow-moving legislative body, already faces potential delays from an expected snowstorm. The House’s planned absence next week complicates matters further ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

All but seven House Democrats voted against the DHS bill in the House, with many in the party seeking body camera requirements and other restraints on raids by ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Top Senate Democrat spending panel member Patty Murray said she won’t support the DHS bill as it stands, and it “needs to be split off from the larger funding package.”

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray said in a post on X. “I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

Signs held in the frigid air read “Justice for Alex” in honor of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, a registered nurse shot and killed by ICE agents in Minneapolis earlier on Saturday.

“Say it once, say it twice, we will not put up with ICE,” the crowd chanted.

One sign was held by Indigo Moore, 27, a school administrator who lives in Manhattan. She was horrified by online videos of Mr. Pretti’s shooting. Ms. Moore said she had been to Union Square on Friday for a similarly frigid protest against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“At this rate I’m getting pretty angry,” she said, “and that’s what’s keeping me warm.”

Attendees expressed a mix of anguished resignation and outraged optimism about what effect the demonstration might have.

For Ella Devi, 18, a Parsons University student who lives in Manhattan and who had campaigned for Mayor Zohran Mamdani in Union Square last year, the turnout was a sign that a political movement for change was gaining force.

“I hope it puts pressure on electeds to abolish ICE,” she said.

Angela Fowler, a psychiatric nurse practitioner who lives in Manhattan, said the protest served less as a portent of a good future than as a place to mourn.

“I’m not angry, I’m hurt,” Ms. Fowler said, adding that Mr. Pretti reminded her of her seven kids, four of whom are veterans. “This is America and I love America,” she said, referring to the scene around her.

Ms. Fowler’s sign read “Protesting ICE Is Not a Crime!” Other signs read, “Stop ICE Terror,” “ICE Is Trump’s Gestapo” and “No Kings.”

Manny Vasquez, 21, a service industry worker from Queens, held a giant sign featuring the face of Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House leader, and the words: “Abolish ICE Jeffries.”

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) believes the Trump administration’s deployment of federal immigration personnel to cities nationwide is part of a quest to “take control” of the midterm elections.
The administration has sent thousands of CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel to Minneapolis, amid a federal probe into fraud within Minnesota’s social services programs.
In addition to Minneapolis, the administration has sent federal immigration enforcement to other Democratic-run cities and states, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and Maine, over the past year.
Murphy said Bondi’s letter is “definitive proof” that the administration has broader plans with those tactics.
It is “trying to trade the presence of ICE and the murder and mayhem that they are causing for control of Minnesota’s elections,” he said.","Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) believes the Trump administration’s deployment of federal immigration personnel to cities nationwide is part of a quest to “take control” of the midterm elections.

“It has always been, I think, the fear, and now I think closer to the reality that the Trump administration is creating this mayhem, particularly in cities in swing states, in order to take control of the election, to say, ‘Oh, the city’s out of control, the state’s out of control, you can’t trust the state government, we just need to run the election in November,’” Murphy told host Dana Bash on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

Murphy’s remarks come less than 24 hours after a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an American citizen, in Minneapolis. The administration has sent thousands of CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel to Minneapolis, amid a federal probe into fraud within Minnesota’s social services programs.

In a Saturday letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) obtained by multiple outlets, Attorney General Pam Bondi asked the governor to share state records on Medicaid and Food and Nutrition Service programs, repeal migrant sanctuary policies and turn voter rolls over to the Department of Justice (DOJ) to “confirm that Minnesota’s voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

The Hill has reached out to the DOJ and Walz’s office for comment.

In addition to Minneapolis, the administration has sent federal immigration enforcement to other Democratic-run cities and states, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City and Maine, over the past year. That has sparked concerns from local and state officials and law enforcement.

Murphy said Bondi’s letter is “definitive proof” that the administration has broader plans with those tactics.

It is “trying to trade the presence of ICE and the murder and mayhem that they are causing for control of Minnesota’s elections,” he said.

BOSTON — A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction just before midnight last night to stop the Trump administration from revoking people’s legal status under the Family Reunification Parole (FRP) program while litigation in Svitlana Doe v. Noem proceeds. This comes after the judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 10 that temporarily blocked the administration from separating those families for 14 days.

More than 8,400 future green card holders faced losing lawful status and work authorization after the Trump administration announced in mid-December 2025 that it would prematurely revoke their parole. Green card holders and U.S. citizen sponsors were left scrambling to gain clarity for their immigrant family members who had already shown eligibility for future green cards. The court heard arguments from the government and from attorneys for plaintiffs earlier this month.

“Today’s ruling reaffirms that the Trump administration cannot ignore our nation’s laws in order to rip immigrant families apart,” said Esther Sung, legal director of Justice Action Center. “We are talking about people who have done everything the U.S. government has asked of them and who, in many cases, are mere weeks or months from finally receiving their green cards. These families should be able to live their lives and pursue their immigration cases peacefully and without fear that they will be ripped away from their loved ones.”

Among other findings, the court’s opinion noted that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the administration’s manner of terminating FRP parole was arbitrary and capricious and that the government had failed to provide FRP beneficiaries with sufficient notice that their grants of parole would be prematurely terminated. In describing the plight facing this particular group of people, the opinion noted, “FRP Parolees have arrived in the United States after a long process, following all directives from USCIS, to obtain lawful permanent residence in this country…many parolees, upon receiving approval to travel to the United States and seek parole, prepare for a permanent move.”

“The Trump administration cannot be allowed to strip people of their legal rights arbitrarily, and we are relieved that the judge recognized this in her ruling,” said Anwen Hughes, senior director of legal strategy and legal initiatives at Human Rights First. “Today’s preliminary injunction means that the Trump administration cannot de-legalize thousands of immigrants throughout the country who have done everything the U.S. government asked of them in order to be here. Most importantly, it means that families will get to remain together and build their futures without being unjustly ripped apart.”

On December 29, 2025, Justice Action Center and Human Rights First rushed into court on behalf of family members of U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents waiting to become eligible to apply for green cards whose parole status would have been revoked on January 14, 2026. These people, who entered the United States under FRP, are represented by five new plaintiffs added to Svitlana Doe v. Noem, the class action lawsuit filed on behalf of humanitarian parole beneficiaries, sponsors, and Haitian Bridge Alliance. The plaintiffs had asked the court to block the Trump administration’s Federal Register Notice revoking FRP beneficiaries’ lawful status and to allow the plaintiffs to incorporate this effort into their existing lawsuit to protect parole.

As tensions in Minneapolis escalated, Lang announced he would be coming to town to lead a “CRUSADER MARCH on ‘Little Somalia,’” with the aim of burning a Quran outside Minneapolis City Hall on Jan. 17.","Donald Trump’s most profound break with American democracy, evident in his words and actions alike, is his view that the state’s relationship with its citizens is defined not by ideals or rules but rather by expressions of power, at the personal direction of the president. That has been clear enough for years, but I had not truly seen what it looked like in person until I arrived in Minneapolis, my hometown, to witness what Trump’s Department of Homeland Security called Operation Metro Surge.

On Jan. 14, at 7:44 p.m., eight hours after I got to town, the City of Minneapolis’s official X account announced that there were “reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in North Minneapolis.” “Federal law enforcement,” as everyone by then knew, meant one of the 3,000 immigration agents fanned out across the metropolitan area, which Minneapolitans invariably called “ICE”: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency at the vanguard of the surge.

They had been there since December, ostensibly in relation to a fraud investigation that fell well out of their departmental purview and settled instead for what appeared outwardly as a more indiscriminate pursuit of potential immigration violations. The Minneapolis metro area is not big: Hennepin and Ramsey Counties — home to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively, and many of their suburbs — are together less than one-fifth the size of Los Angeles County, the target of the administration’s first such immigration crackdown last year.

In the heightened atmosphere of the moment, the lines between documentation and confrontation had grown blurry. ICE officers, when they stuck around anywhere for more than a few minutes, were likely to be met by not just one or two camera-wielding observers but many, and observation inevitably turned into protest. The latent combustibility of these encounters was visible in the footage that bystanders had captured of an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, fatally shooting a resident, Renee Good, in her car on a snowy street in South Minneapolis on Jan. 7. That combustibility would be visible again in the fatal shooting on Jan. 24 of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old V.A. hospital registered nurse, by Border Patrol agents.

Shock over the violence of the deployment quickly gave way to redoubled anger. Within minutes of the city’s X post on Jan. 14, a crowd of perhaps a hundred people from all over the metro area had assembled at the location, in the Hawthorne neighborhood on Minneapolis’s north side, where, according to an F.B.I. agent’s affidavit, an ICE agent had shot an undocumented immigrant in the leg after being attacked with a broom during an arrest. When I arrived, several blocks were cordoned off with crime-scene tape, and milling around in the darkness beyond it were federal agents in balaclavas and tactical gear, most of them identified by their patches as members of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations unit.

A woman in a fur-ruffed parka swung a plastic post at the rear windshield of the vehicle, which shattered with a dull crunch. It was not long before the air was alive with smoke grenades and sting balls and thick with tear gas. Faces peered out of second-floor windows along what had been, less than an hour earlier, a quiet residential street. “You killed Renee Good!” a man bellowed.

The atmosphere was strange and unstable for a street protest, missing some important steps of the usual choreography, and it took me a moment to realize why: I saw no police officers. I had passed a Minneapolis Police Department cruiser parked some distance down the street, but here, where the agents were clashing with the crowd, they were nowhere to be seen. The federal agents themselves looked more like a platoon of soldiers navigating a hostile foreign capital than conventional law enforcement in an American city.

For weeks, these agents had been actors in a kind of theater of power, meting out various forms of state force and violence, framed by the smartphone cameras they carried, providing a steady stream of content for the Trump administration’s various social media platforms. What was clear in person, seeing the scene outside of the frame, were the limits of this performance of power. The agents had no capacity to maintain order or much apparent interest in doing so. Their presence was a vector of chaos, and controlling it was not in their job description. All that was holding the crowd back, as far as I could tell, was the knowledge that an officer like these shot a woman a week earlier and that another shot a man up the street an hour ago. I left the scene that night certain it would happen again.

‘Take Out That Phone and Hit Record’

Tim Walz, Minnesota’s embattled governor, appeared live on camera from his official residence on the night of the second shooting and clash. He described the federal deployment to his state as an “occupation” and “a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

This sort of citizen surveillance of federal agents is a tactic that had spread widely — often with the support of Democratic officials like Walz — along with the immigration raids themselves, refined over the course of previous operations in Los Angeles and especially Chicago. As Walz suggested, it served a kind of double purpose: capturing evidence and also capturing the narrative, showing the world what Trump’s immigration crackdown looked like in practice.

Because of Minneapolis’s small size, the sledgehammer scale of the deployment and the extreme contempt that Minneapolitans had for it, ICE-watching had attained a manic intensity in some neighborhoods of the city, which became an exacerbating factor in the fog-of-war confusion and paranoia the raids brought to town.

One afternoon, I was idling in my rental car in the parking lot of a gas station where my friends used to buy cigarettes in high school when I heard a shrill chorus of whistles behind me — Minneapolitans, like Chicagoans last year, had distributed them widely and blew them en masse to alert people to ICE’s whereabouts. I got out to look around, only to see that the whistlers were pointing at me. It was the third time I had been mistaken for an ICE agent in the space of a week.

On the ICE-watchers’ heels was a pack of journalists, many of whom I knew from the expanding media circuit of the great American unraveling: militia rallies, Trump court appearances, protests against immigration raids in other cities. I reached out to shake the hand of a celebrated war photographer, but he retracted it, holding up his palms apologetically: “Mace,” he said.

They had just come from a clash in a nearby park between locals and Gregory Bovino, the camera-mugging senior Border Patrol official, who had been on the scene in Minneapolis personally for weeks, ducking in and out of the action, often dressed in a military-style greatcoat that invited, and received, Gestapo comparisons. Someone pulled out a phone to show me a video of Bovino minutes earlier, personally lobbing a green-smoke grenade at some protesters, with the jocular informality of a backyard barbecue host tossing a tallboy to a newly arrived neighbor. As they left, once again a federal agent dropped a magazine of live ammunition in the street. Officers from Bovino’s agency would shoot and kill Pretti less than a mile away three days later.

What was striking, and not a little chilling, when you watched videos like this as well as their public digestion on various social media platforms, was that they did not differ dramatically from the videos that the Trump administration disseminated itself. Nor did people on either side of the country’s chasmic ideological divide seem to disagree all that much about what they were seeing in the images of immigrants being marched away from their cars in subzero temperatures and demonstrators pepper-sprayed at point-blank range. These were pictures of the state deploying violence confidently and with open disinterest for the niceties of process or protocol — the expression of power as an end to itself. To some, it was horrifying; to others, it was exhilarating. To many city residents I talked to, the message of it all was clear enough: Nobody could help them. They were on their own.

“I’ve been telling people, if you want to really be prepared for stuff like this that’s going on in Minneapolis right now, you need to know your neighbors,” Steve Gagner, a resident, told me the day after Walz’s address. We were sitting at a coffee shop not far from Gagner’s house in South Minneapolis, an area that had become the heart of the local resistance to the federal deployment. The shop’s owner was running around directing pickups and drop-offs of boxed groceries and household necessities stacked by the door: donations for the thousands of immigrant families, undocumented and otherwise, that were known to be hiding out in their homes across the metro area for fear of arrest.

South Minneapolis might be thought of, in coastal terms, as roughly comparable to Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights or Los Angeles’s Echo Park: a historically diverse (by Minneapolis standards) and working-class area that was now the gravitational center of the city’s college-educated, progressive professional cohort, a neighborhood of social workers and graphic designers. Gagner, a longhaired 41-year-old who grew up in the suburbs, now lives in the city with two children and twice as many jobs: carpentry and handyman work, animation and jewelry design. He had made the earrings he was wearing, in the image of the Minnesota state flag, which had taken on an unexpected valence in recent weeks as a banner of defiance.

South Minneapolis was also where George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in 2020. At the time, Gagner lived five blocks from the Third Precinct police station, where the officer, Derek Chauvin, was assigned; the first group of demonstrators had marched past Gagner’s house on the way to the station. “We were actually out there, clapping,” he said. Half an hour later, tear gas began wafting into the open windows. “And then,” he said, “everything erupted.”

The protests and rioting that followed Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, in which the Third Precinct building and a number of local businesses were burned down, were often depicted in the national media as occurring along racial lines, which was not quite right. They raged most furiously in largely white South Minneapolis, not the historically Black north-side neighborhoods like Hawthorne. Gagner had supported the protests and was highly critical of the Police Department, but he also did not particularly want his house to burn down.

He and others in nearby neighborhoods had formed ad hoc community-watch groups during the first days of the upheaval, and much of this informal infrastructure had been revived amid the current crisis. “I’ve seen a lot of the same people that stepped up before stepping right back into those roles,” Gagner said, though now people were using encrypted communications or staying offline entirely. “It’s also very different because this is” — his voice dropped to an incredulous whisper — “this is the government.”

Although the work they were doing was, in the current climate, clearly political, it felt strange to describe Gagner or anyone else I met who was involved in the rudimentary activities of the resistance as activists; most of their activities would, in any other circumstances, have seemed like the most uncontroversial kind of civic participation. Since the early days of the standoff, many people across the Twin Cities and their suburbs had joined neighborhood-level efforts, organized through Signal chats, to track the federal agents and had stood watch around locations — schools, apartment buildings, local businesses — they believed were particularly vulnerable.

But by mid-January, many of the people I talked to in South Minneapolis had decided it was more useful to focus on the targets of the raids, giving immigrant families’ children rides to school — federal agents in Minnesota and other states had been arresting parents during drop-offs and pickups — and delivering supplies to those who were afraid to leave their homes.

Other response efforts were coordinated through parent-teacher organizations, particularly those of schools with large populations of Latino students. The school-based organizing, like the ICE-watching tactics, was a strategy imported from community networks in Chicago, where parents last year mobilized around so-called sanctuary schools. Particularly for parents of elementary-school-age children, who found themselves suddenly having to explain why parents were standing guard against federal agents around the school property and why their Latino classmates were staying home, their latent politics had been supercharged by a very parental mix of fear and fury.

A mother at another school in South Minneapolis, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid drawing further attention to the school, described coming upon ICE agents detaining the driver of a car, then taking him away along with the keys. Looking in the abandoned vehicle, she saw a woman in the front seat and a small child huddled in the back seat. “They just — take off,” she said, and she started sobbing. “They just walk away. They don’t care. It’s like — we’re all people.”

I asked her how she discussed what was happening with her own children. “We’re lying to them all the time,” she said. “‘You are not in danger.’ I don’t think they are, but we can’t guarantee that. Because they” — ICE — “are not following the rules. We’re white, but who knows? You look at them wrong, and they’re going to smash your window.”

‘Don’t Turn On the Lights’

One afternoon later that week, I drove out to a nondescript lower-income apartment complex in a Minneapolis suburb. A man in his 30s let me into the building and led the way up to an apartment on the third floor, then closed the door behind us.

The apartment was small, and it felt smaller with the windows covered. The man and his wife, both of whom asked not to be identified out of fear of arrest, had tacked up a blanket over one window and a floral-print sheet over the other, illuminated by the wan winter light outside. Their young daughters would try to peek out, but the parents would shoo them away from the windows. If anyone pulled back the sheet, they warned the girls, drones could see inside.

The man left the apartment only for the most furtive missions: to take out the trash, to move the car when snowplows came to clear the parking lot. It took him a moment to recall when he had last ventured farther than that. It was November, he thought. That was around the time that “the school,” he said, “let us know that the raids were happening.”

The building was home to a number of immigrants like the man, who said he came with his wife and their daughters several years ago from Ecuador. He said they had petitioned for asylum at the border. This was a legal process under which an increasing number of people had been admitted during the Biden administration. Some asylum applicants cited highly specific threats to their lives. Others made much broader claims, like this man, who said he and his family had come to the United States because of prejudice against the country’s Indigenous people and the escalating violence in the capital, Quito, where they lived. Peaceful as recently as six years ago, it had since become a battleground in a proxy war between Mexican drug cartels vying for control of Pacific-coast smuggling routes.

The family’s claim was still in process, the man said. In the meantime, he said he had been given a work permit and a Social Security number. In the summer, he cut lawns; in the winter, he cleared snow. But an administrator at his daughters’ school had warned him that he should be careful about working outside. He began watching the street from inside the apartment.

He noticed large S.U.V.s, Chevy Suburbans with tinted windows, idling outside the apartment complex for a few hours at a stretch. He took a picture of one of them and sent it to someone at the school. “They told us: ‘They’re ICE. Be careful,’” he said. “‘Cover the windows. Don’t turn on the lights. Don’t go out shopping. If you need anything, ask.’” That was nearly two months ago.

It had taken a week or two, after the man stopped going to work and everyone stopped leaving the apartment, for the food to run out. After days of eating only potatoes, the family appealed for help to their church. Soon volunteers began dropping off essentials in cardboard boxes.

At first the family kept the girls home from school. But after the school warned that such absences could result in legal action, the girls resumed going every other day, escorted by a teacher or an administrator.

The girls asked why they couldn’t otherwise leave the apartment, why they couldn’t buy food themselves, why they couldn’t look out the windows, and the man tried to figure out what to tell them. “I have told them that there are people out there looking for criminals,” he said. Like most of the immigrants I met in Minnesota and elsewhere who had been affected by the immigration raids or were living in fear of them, he had supported the idea of rounding up violent criminals in the United States illegally when Trump first spoke of it. And he assured his daughters that he was not a criminal himself. “But we’re not from this country,” he would tell them, he said, “and we have to be careful. Because they’re taking everybody.”

Although his wife couldn’t bring herself to mention it to the girls, lately the man had started trying to talk to them about what would happen if their parents were arrested. This was difficult in part because he himself did not know what would happen. When it became clear that the federal agents sweeping the city had no plan for the children the raids left behind, school staff members started quietly urging immigrant parents to sign a delegation of parental authority form, which would give someone else the power to make decisions over their children — a limited form of custody. But who could the man even ask to take on such a responsibility? His family’s relatives in Minnesota were all in the same position as he was.

I asked the man how he knew the drivers at the intersection were ICE agents. “They were in two of those big trucks — the really big new ones that are driving around,” he said. Were they wearing masks? He didn’t know.

At some point, the paranoia in Minneapolis had created its own reality. The furtiveness and randomness of the documented raids was very real, but now half of Minneapolis and an ever-expanding press corps were driving around looking for federal agents, too, prowling streets and parking lots in ways that resembled the agents themselves, creating their own layers of rumor and confusion.

When I had first pulled into the apartment building’s parking lot, I saw an S.U.V. idling by the entrance, an iPhone visible against the windshield, filming me. When I got out and held up my press credential, the window rolled down to reveal two smiling white women who were out delivering food to people like the family in the apartment. “Sorry!” one of them said brightly.

Leaving the building an hour later, I saw two more large S.U.V.s slowly circling the lot. Were they ICE agents? Were they people watching for ICE agents? Who knew? Earlier that day, outside a church that was distributing aid, I overheard a young man on his phone reporting a “confirmed ICE” vehicle. I looked around for it, until I realized he was reading off the license plate from my rental car.

‘The Somalis Have Taken Over Your Neighborhoods!’

When Trump, hours after returning to the presidency last year, pardoned the participants in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, one beneficiary was Edward Jacob Lang, a 30-year-old from upstate New York who had spent several years in jail awaiting trial on 11 charges for, among other things, attacking a Capitol Police officer with a metal baseball bat. Lang, who goes by Jake, had parlayed his incarceration into a brand as a sort of political prisoner-influencer, though he did not seem to actually have much of a profile on the right; two years ago, I stopped by a protest on his behalf outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was being held, and found it attended by fewer than 10 supporters. The people who most fervently followed him and his stunts — claiming to form a militia from inside jail, throwing Nazi salutes outside the AIPAC headquarters — seemed to be gullible and easily outraged liberals, along with the more shamelessly click-baiting reporters whose content they consumed.

As tensions in Minneapolis escalated, Lang announced he would be coming to town to lead a “CRUSADER MARCH on ‘Little Somalia,’” with the aim of burning a Quran outside Minneapolis City Hall on Jan. 17. The main, if unintended, effect of Lang’s announcement, besides stirring up the people who could be counted on to react to it, was to call attention to just how far Trump’s crackdown had drifted from its stated intentions. Trump initially said federal agents were coming to town in relation to the federal investigation of a several-billion-dollar fraud scandal involving the state’s social services, which had produced indictments of nearly 80 people, most of them members of the state’s Somali community — the largest Somali diaspora population in the country, much of it refugees who settled in Minnesota in the 1990s.

Trump, who had vowed to stop refugee flows to Minnesota during his 2016 campaign, had ranted against Somalis in December, calling them “garbage” in a cabinet meeting. But a majority of Minnesotan Somalis have U.S. citizenship, and by the time Lang came to town, the agents’ attention seemed to have largely shifted; the few arrests that D.H.S. publicly announced appeared to be mostly Latinos and Hmong immigrants.

“The Somalis have taken over your neighborhoods!” Lang shouted into a microphone as he marched through downtown. He was clad in a tactical vest that made him resemble the city’s new diaspora population of ICE agents; as right-wing influencers and law enforcement have embraced similar paramilitary gear and content-creation strategies, the lines that might have once distinguished them visually have grown sketchier. “These people are animals. Look at them! Look at them! Immigrant scum!”

When he got to City Hall, a crowd of perhaps several hundred counterprotesters was waiting for him. They leaned toward the most reliably bait-taking segments of the left-liberal spectrum, from the itinerant leftists leading chants for unrelated causes — “Free Palestine!” — with their own megaphones to older suburbanites holding up signs that read “LOVE ALWAYS WINS.” The South Minneapolis types I had been talking to throughout the week had been urging nonattendance.

I had wondered what a clash between whichever constituency Lang managed to mobilize — it was about 10 people — and an increasingly infuriated population would look like in a city where local law enforcement had been barely visible for days. Making my way through the crowd, I found Lang holed up in the well of a ground-floor window of City Hall along with a few others, gamely enduring the attacks of the crowd: an endless barrage of insults, a squirt gun that lashed him with gouts of freezing cold water and water balloons.

This was a move pioneered during Trump’s first term by more-enterprising right-wing influencers who, with video rolling, would place themselves in the path of particularly knuckle-headed anarchists in cities like Portland, Ore., and lean into their beatings with the verve of Italian soccer players. But there was, once again, something off about the way it was playing out in Minneapolis. I climbed onto a bench to get a better look, just in time to see Lang, who had jumped down from the window well, disappear into a sea of windmilling fists for several minutes, then emerge out the other side.

As the scrum surged in my direction, I joined the crush of people running after Lang, turning the corner past City Hall and bounding over a light-rail track. A man to my left turned and decked another man in the face. Both were wearing balaclavas and heavy coats; everyone was bundled up in so many layers of outerwear — the temperature was in the single digits — that the usual signifiers of political identities were impossible to make out. All anyone seemed to really know was that everyone was either chasing Lang or chasing the people chasing him, and that nobody seemed to be stopping anything; we had passed a single police cruiser idling alongside City Hall.

Lang made it several blocks, as far as the doorstep of the Hotel Indigo, before his pursuers caught up with him, knocked him down and began vigorously kicking him in the head. He managed to get to his feet and sprinted through the hotel bar with a few photographers in tow, crashing out a side entrance and into the back seat of a passing car, which a mob briefly waylaid in traffic before the vehicle managed to get free. (One of his rescuers, a transgender woman named Daye Gottsche, later told a local reporter that she had made it clear to Lang, as they drove him to safety, that she did “not support the type of man he is.”)

From the back of the crowd, it had been hard to follow exactly what was happening, and a number of demonstrators, believing Lang to be inside the hotel, lingered outside. Jody Carr, a retiree from the exurb Chaska, looked on from across the street with her daughter, a nurse. “I am disappointed in the people who’ve gotten violent, because that is not what this is about,” Carr told me. She had attended recent No Kings protests in Chaska; this was her first demonstration related to the ICE deployment. “I’m proud to be an American, but I’m not proud of what our administration is doing,” she said. One of her daughter’s co-workers, an American-born woman of Kenyan descent, had been stopped a few weeks before by ICE and thrown out of her car, she said — “in her scrubs on the way to work!”

Chaska sits on the far periphery of the Minneapolis metropolitan area, a politically mixed territory between the solidly Democratic metro area and Republican rural areas beyond. I asked Carr if there was disagreement about the deployment among the people she knew there, and she nodded.

“My niece told me I was a threat to humanity,” she said.

Just then, a van pulled up carrying a dozen Minneapolis Police Department officers in riot gear, arriving belatedly to disperse the crowd. Following a couple of bullhorn announcements about the impending use of chemical agents — after ICE, which fired them off with no warning, this seemed quaint — the demonstrators took an impromptu victory lap through the streets of downtown. A man with a drum led a call and response:

“Who protects us?”

“We protect us!""

I left the protest feeling numb: It seemed as if we had all come fairly close to seeing a man beaten to death in the street. I called Lang the next night to ask how he was doing.

Lang was back on the East Coast already. He told me he was up for an interview, but only if we did it in the form of a video clip that I would guarantee The Times would publish, and that he would as well. “That’s usually the way that I’m leaning toward things now, because the video content is so important for dissemination on both our social media platforms,” he said. We would not copublish a video. I went to sleep feeling a little sheepish. Lang was going to be fine.

The content, as he surely knew, was exceptional.

‘Get Out of the City’

I went to meet Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis at Karmel Mall, a large and labyrinthine complex of Somali businesses on Lake Street in South Minneapolis, on the afternoon of Jan. 22. The location was his staff’s choice, and a pointed one. As we walked through the mall, it was largely empty, with most of the market stalls closed and locked down behind metal shutters, another picture of a city battened down in a storm. The Islamic afternoon call to prayer drifted from a speaker over a deserted hallway. In one of the few open stalls, he spotted a merchant he knew. “Osman!” he called out. The man greeted him with a hug. “You are winning,” he said.

Although Walz’s career had run aground amid the fraud scandal — he announced, amid Operation Metro Surge, that he would not be running for governor again — Frey, like Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, had arguably benefited from the enemy-of-my-enemy politics the federal invasion foisted upon Minneapolis. Although he easily won re-election in November, many south-side progressives still grumbled about his support for the city’s Police Department during the George Floyd crisis, which had led to his heckling out of George Floyd Square during a visit to the memorial that June.

“I got spat on and shamed and booed,” he told me, tucking into a plate of goat and rice in the otherwise deserted food court. “But it was the right decision” not to defund the Police Department, he said. “And it’s the right decision now to tell ICE to get out of the city.”

Like other mayors and governors who had found themselves on the receiving end of Trump’s immigration raids, Frey — who, like Walz, is currently under investigation by Trump’s Justice Department for impeding the federal action — had responded with lawsuits and media appearances, projecting unequivocal defiance while carefully keeping city law-enforcement agencies out of the fray. When I brought up the Lang episode, he told me that the police, uniformed and not, were nearby, ready to intervene if necessary. “It had the potential to be a complete disaster, and it wasn’t,” he said.

This was true, but in the moment, that outcome had seemed to be luck as much as anything else; I hadn’t seen any officers around until well after the beating, I said. “They were there,” Frey insisted, “and they did run to help” Lang before he got away in the car. Lang, he pointed out, had not actually filed a police report about the assault.

Trump’s federal deployment in Minneapolis, like the others before it, was not only about immigration; it was also a kind of ritual disciplining of unruly liberals, a ripping away of the protections they had so long enjoyed and a demonstration of how little the politicians they elected could really do to stop it. This would be underscored two days later, hours after I left Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents confronting neighborhood observers several blocks from Karmel Mall shot Pretti, repeatedly and apparently after first disarming him of a gun he was licensed to carry and was not holding, based on video footage.

Only a couple of food vendors adjoining the food court were open, and when we arrived, Frey had stopped to commiserate with one of them, a young Somali man. “It’ll be like a light switch when ICE leaves,” he said. “It’ll be a celebration.”

“We’re going to have a big party,” the man said, hopefully.

Frey nodded. “People will be dancing in the hallways here.”

His promise echoed down the empty hall.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin shared a photo on social media Saturday of a federal law enforcement officer's severed finger after an anti-ICE agitator in Minneapolis allegedly bit it off.

""In Minneapolis, these rioters attacked our law enforcement officer and one of them bit off our HSI officer’s finger,"" McLaughlin wrote in the post. ""He will lose his finger.""

She shared photos of two people seemingly in custody, though it is unclear which person is the alleged biter.

Additional details about the assault have not yet been released, though ongoing protests have escalated after the deaths of two U.S. citizens during immigration enforcement operations in the blue city.

ICE SAYS 2 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING OFFICERS

Hours before McLaughlin's post, a Border Patrol agent was captured on video fatally shooting an armed man in Minneapolis amid a crowd of agitators.

The 37-year-old man, a U.S. citizen from Minneapolis, allegedly approached agents and then ""violently resisted,"" while armed with a 9 mm pistol and two magazines, according to Homeland Security officials.

Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said during a news conference Saturday it ""look[ed] like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.""

He reiterated that those who obstruct law enforcement are in violation of the law and will be arrested.

The Minnesota National Guard confirmed Saturday that, in addition to troops previously being mobilized at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office requested additional support, and more soldiers will be brought in.

“Our kuleana (responsibility) really is to be there as a calm, informed presence so that folks are aware that they have rights,” Goodman said.
Last week, El Pueblo en Acción Maui announced on social media that ICE agents had showed up to a Kīhei church during sacrament hour on Jan. 11.
On Maui, Mendoza-Jachowski said people have been taken more “quietly” than in other places.
“The Episcopal Church remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the dignity and safety of all people, particularly those most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions,” Spence said.","It was the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah when Zoe Goodman got the heads up that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were searching for someone in a temporary housing complex for Lahaina fire survivors.

Goodman, the lead volunteer trainer for El Pueblo en Acción Maui (The People in Action Maui), hustled over to the neighborhood. As the agents roamed the complex in a rented pickup, Goodman and other volunteers helped the person run through preparations, making sure they had an emergency contact and had signed a document that would allow a lawyer to contact them if they were taken into custody by ICE.

“Our kuleana (responsibility) really is to be there as a calm, informed presence so that folks are aware that they have rights,” Goodman said.

The agents eventually left the area without making an arrest, but the September episode was one of multiple confirmed and suspected sightings of ICE that have put the Maui community on edge, especially as arrests in Hawai‘i have climbed over the past year and an ICE agent’s fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Good sparked protests across the islands. On Saturday, a Minneapolis man was shot and killed by ICE, setting off a fresh wave of outrage.

On Maui, community groups and concerned citizens focused on immigrant rights and legal services created a coalition known as El Pueblo en Acción Maui to run an ICE tipline and watch group around late 2023 and early 2024, according to Veronica Mendoza-Jachowski, executive director of the nonprofit Roots Reborn that was formed after the fires and is part of the coalition. For awhile, it was the only group of its kind in the state, she said.

The network that Goodman estimated at 50 volunteers can be called at a moment’s notice to verify ICE sightings, help people review their rights and serve as legal observers when someone is being detained in hopes that they won’t get lost in “a black hole of the immigration and detention system.”

They’ve been extra busy over the past year. When Trump took office in January 2025, the tipline was flooded with dozens of text messages, emails and calls from people thinking they’d seen ICE.

“That fear was just heightened and they were on alert,” Mendoza-Jachowski said.

Last week, El Pueblo en Acción Maui announced on social media that ICE agents had showed up to a Kīhei church during sacrament hour on Jan. 11. While no arrests were made, it was another sobering reminder for the community that places once considered off-limits are now fair game to the federal agency.

“The worry here is as we continue to see ICE enforcement presence at these previously protected locations, that there will be a chilling effect,” said Tina Sablan, community and policy advocate with O‘ahu-based nonprofit The Legal Clinic. “Not only that people will stop going to church … but also kids will be afraid to go to school. Families will be afraid to access health care that they need. And there are ramifications for the entire community that will affect a wider sense of public safety when these places are no longer considered protected.”

In the first six months of 2025, ICE arrested 149 people in Hawai‘i, more than triple the amount of people arrested during the same period in 2024, the University of Hawai‘i’s Refugee and Immigration Law Clinic told a Senate Judiciary Committee in December, citing the Deportation Data Project.

ICE claims it’s detaining the “worst of the worst,” highlighting a handful of arrests tied to serious crimes like drugs, assault and firearms possessions. But Sablan pointed out that according to detentionreports.com, which keeps data on ICE detention facilities nationwide, out of a total average daily population of 74 at the Honolulu facility, 57 individuals (77%) were non-criminals.

On Maui, Mendoza-Jachowski said people have been taken more “quietly” than in other places. Aside from the high-profile case of several Maui County teachers who were wrongfully detained in Kahului as immigration officers were searching for someone else, arrests have included individual encounters like a Lahaina fire survivor who lost his home and business, and an undocumented Maui man who showed up at the Wailuku courthouse for a hearing on driving under the influence and without a license.

By contrast, ICE has made mass arrests during raids of Hawai‘i island coffee farms and Kaua‘i homes and businesses.

Sablan said she’s not sure why other islands have seen more mass enforcement, but noted that Maui has “a really strong network of folks” who have been working to educate people on their rights and keep tabs on ICE.

“I think that’s been really effective and had a very protective effect, particularly on communities in Maui,” Sablan said.

Mendoza-Jachowski said the experience of working in disaster response has helped the Maui organizations become more nimble in the face of growing enforcement and constant uncertainty.

El Pueblo en Acción Maui has been holding “Know Your Rights” training for restaurant workers, health care providers, faith leaders, educators and others, reminding them of such constitutional rights as being able to remain silent and refuse a search of themselves or their belongings without a judicial warrant.

Mendoza-Jachowski said “we don’t want anyone breaking the law,” so the goal is to inform people on their rights and equip them to make their own decisions in the moment.

Keeping the community informed and curbing false information is also the focus of the tipline, which takes calls and texts at (808) 500-5533. Volunteers work to confirm or debunk sightings by going to the location themselves or examining photos submitted to the tipline.

Mendoza-Jachowski remembers one report that turned out to be a DUI checkpoint near Mā‘alaea, and another that was a traffic control measure for a construction site. Once they used reverse image search to determine a photo sent to the tipline of law enforcement at a grocery store had actually been circulating on social media over a year ago and showed officers with the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources, whose green uniforms and holstered guns were reminiscent of ICE agents.

When it comes to deciding what to report, “we take that very seriously,” Mendoza-Jachowski said.

“We don’t want to start a frenzy,” she said. “So I think keeping our community calm means keeping our community safe, and so there is no very clear recipe for how we respond because every single one is so different.”

She said the groups decided to share information about the reports of ICE agents in a Kīhei church earlier this month because it came directly from a “trusted source” who witnessed firsthand the agents showing up and identifying themselves as immigration enforcement. They told church leaders that they were looking for three people and waited out the full service until they determined the people in question weren’t there.

For safety reasons, Mendoza-Jachowski did not share the name of the church.

Members of other churches in Kīhei said they’d also heard about the incident. Shannon Kama, church administrator at Kīhei Lutheran, said she’d gotten word about it from social media and the community service organizations that work with the church.

Kama said her church hasn’t discussed what they would do if ICE showed up, but she said if she saw them coming, “I would lock my office down and I would notify our Montessori preschool on property, just to try to keep everybody safe.”

“It’s just awful,” Kama said of the thought that ICE might come to a church. “Nobody wants to be fearful. We just need to all be mindful, and I think that’s our mindset of our congregation. … Personally, I just pray that nothing like that would happen and be protective of everybody else.”

Chuck Spence, treasurer of Trinity Episcopal-by-the-Sea in Kīhei, said he found out through text messages sharing the post from El Pueblo en Acción Maui. He said Trinity hasn’t had any encounters with ICE as far as he knows, and that the church holds prayers every week for people impacted by what is happening across the country.

“It’s too aggressive and too dangerous when people are starting to get killed,” Spence said.

He noted that Trinity “is an inclusive and all welcoming mission church” and pointed out that Episcopal Church leaders have condemned ICE-related violence, called for prayer and supported peaceful resistance.

“The Episcopal Church remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the dignity and safety of all people, particularly those most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions,” Spence said.

Churches have long been seen as safe havens off-limits to immigration enforcement, but in January 2025, after taking office, the Trump administration rolled back those protections for churches and other “sensitive” places like schools.

Hawai‘i state lawmakers, who kicked off the 2026 session on Wednesday, are considering a bill that would restore protections for sensitive locations, Sablan said.

It’s one of several bills The Legal Clinic and other immigration-focused organizations will be tracking, including measures that would require clear identification and bar masks for public-facing law enforcement, create a statewide framework for “U” and “T” visa certification for noncitizens who are victims of crime and human trafficking, and prevent “287g agreements” that would deputize local officers to carry out civil immigration enforcement.

In her line of work, Sablan often hears comments that if people were here legally, they wouldn’t have anything to worry about. However, she thinks “there’s a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of how much has changed” to make legal immigration pathways more difficult to obtain, and in some cases, revoking legal status of people already here.

Regardless of their status, Sablan pointed out, everybody “has basic due process rights and a right to a fair hearing, and they should have a right to legal representation.” Federal immigration court is the only court people don’t have the right to a public defender, she pointed out.

The argument that only “the worst” criminals are being taken off the streets doesn’t align with the data, and she said she has to “fundamentally disagree with the argument that it’s worth it to violate the rights of all.”

“If one person’s due process rights are violated, nobody really can feel safe believing that the same couldn’t happen to them,” Sablan said.

On Maui, if someone is detained, groups like Maui Rapid Response, another member of El Pueblo en Acción Maui, step in to help connect their families to services, especially if the person taken was the “sole breadwinner.”

“We’re looking at things like rent, we’re looking at child care, we’re looking at just housing in general, transportation,” said Nicole Huguenin, executive director of Maui Rapid Response.

The organization leads several community initiatives that range from helping unhoused people to assisting with fire recovery. Huguenin noted that people’s needs are often intersectional, such as being both undocumented and unhoused, and she said the fear of being arrested and deported has put additional stress on people already struggling to recover from the wildfires. Nearly one-third of Lahaina’s population before the fire had been born in another country.

“What we’re really seeing across the board in all vulnerable populations of people right now is compounding traumas,” Huguenin said.

In Lahaina, an arrest in September 2024 frightened parts of the community, and the incident in September of last year reignited those fears. Since then, Goodman said all of the four other potential sightings that she’s responded to have been in Lahaina.

She said “it is especially painful” to see people experiencing a moment when they know ICE is coming for them after being a contributing member of the community they’ve lived in for years.

Goodman spent 15 years working with a program that escorted women safely to abortion clinics in Queens, New York, so she’s “no stranger” to encounters with police or protesters shouting in her face. If ICE agents are “yanking people out of cars,” her sentiment is “put me in, coach.” But when she responds on Maui, her main focus is making sure her presence doesn’t make things worse for the people she’s trying to help.

Goodman said if the crackdown was about doing things the right way, ICE wouldn’t be showing up to detain people at their immigration hearings or sweeping kids out of school.

“The right way does not involve terrorizing people who are doing all of the right things,” Goodman said. “…There is no right way in this moment in time, because we’ve designed a system that is terrorizing everybody.”",https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2026/01/50044713306_cff977c927_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 15:57:15.712535

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.
The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""
It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown.
It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown.","The U.S. government is nearing the brink of a partial shutdown by the end of the week after federal immigration agents shot and killed a U.S. citizen in Minnesota on Saturday, the second such incident this month.

The Senate is set to vote this week on a massive House-passed $1.2 trillion package to fund the Department of Homeland Security, along with a wide swath of government, before the Jan. 30 deadline. But the shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is now threatening to derail the funding package as a growing chorus of Democrats warns they will oppose it unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is stripped out.

""I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,"" said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and helped end last year's 43-day shutdown, on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown,"" he said.

King's comments significantly raise the likelihood of a shutdown over DHS funding by the end of the week. He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.

The House of Representatives, which left Washington last week for a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would need to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It's unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or will do so.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.

""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday night.

The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure. Of the 47, two are independents who caucus with Democrats.

Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury.

But Pretti's death is rapidly galvanizing Democratic opposition to the measure.

""No, I am not voting for this funding,"" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.""

The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier in the week that the ""suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray said on X Saturday. ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""

It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up.

It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats.

DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" law passed last summer.

But that's far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end a record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.

""I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,"" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown. ""Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown.

“Yes, it’s a problem that Iran is the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism.
Machado said Iran and Venezuela were bound by deep cooperation between their rulers, even as people in both countries rise up against repression.
“Finally in Venezuela we’re seeing President Trump making a tremendous important decision,” she said.
“If the people of Iran were free, the contributions they could make to science, culture, and technology would be extraordinary,” he said.","The non-profit Jewish Institute for National Security of America, founded in 1976, advocates for a strong US military relationship with Israel and researches conflict in the Middle East.

JINSA president and CEO Michael Makovsky and the group’s vice president for policy Blaise Misztal told Iran International’s English-language podcast Eye for Iran that decades of containment, deterrence and nuclear diplomacy have failed because the Islamic Republic itself should be destroyed.

“It should be US policy to seek the collapse of this regime,” Makovsky said.

They said hesitation now — after mass killings of protesters across Iran — risks emboldening Tehran at the theocracy's weakest moment.

“We don’t say regime change,” Makovsky said. “The regime will fall … only when the Iranian people bring it down. But it should be US policy … to seek the collapse of this regime.”

The last months, Misztal said, have created a rare strategic opening: Iran’s nuclear clock has been set back, its regional proxies weakened and Iranians themselves have returned to the streets demanding freedom.

“This is a moment like no other,” he said. “I don’t know when the stars will align like this again… why not make it now? When is a better time than now?”

The duo urged the Trump administration to abandon negotiations, intensify pressure on the Revolutionary Guards and build the infrastructure needed to help Iranians defeat the Islamic Republic.

Misztal said previous administrations focused on Iran’s nuclear program, terrorism sponsorship and ballistic missile development as separate threats without tying them back to what he called the ideological nature of the theocracy.

“Yes, it’s a problem that Iran is the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, it is a problem that it’s pursuing nuclear weapons,” he said. “But all of that stems from it being the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

Trump’s Promises and a Moment of Decision

Their warnings come as President Donald Trump faces rising scrutiny over his own rhetoric. Earlier this month, Trump vowed support for protesters and issued a direct warning to Tehran.

“I tell the Iranian leaders: You better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting, too,” he said.

But Makovsky warned that after mass killings and widespread arrests, the absence of immediate consequences risks damaging US credibility.

“The Iranians have called his bluff for now,” he said. “If he doesn’t do it, it will go down as a tragic mistake.”

In recent days, Trump has said a US ""armada"" is heading toward the Middle East, with the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers expected to arrive in the region soon as Washington signals it is positioning military assets amid escalating uncertainty.

The growing tensions are now rippling far beyond Iran itself.

Major European airlines have begun suspending flights across parts of the Middle East, citing security concerns. Air France has canceled flights to Tel Aviv and Dubai, British Airways has halted evening service to Dubai and KLM has suspended routes to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Industry officials say cancellations are expected to increase gradually as carriers reassess airspace restrictions and passenger safety in a rapidly deteriorating regional environment.

A Cold War–Style Pressure Campaign

Misztal framed the strategy as a modern version of what the United States pursued against Soviet communism: strengthening civil resistance while weakening the ruling system from within.

“The strategy of regime collapse has been precisely what the United States pursued throughout the Cold War,” he said.

He argued that Washington should encourage defections, isolate elites in authority, cut off funding streams and expand opposition communications.

“One of the things we recommended is a quarantine of Iran’s oil exports,” Misztal said, “so that it doesn’t keep getting the money to rebuild its forces to pay the Basij or the IRGC.”

Both analysts warned that Iran’s leadership is entering what they described as its most dangerous phase, amid mass violence at home and the potential for war abraod.

“A showdown of some kind” is coming, Misztal said, and “the next showdown will be the last one.""

The warnings would mark a sharp uptick in rhetoric on Iraq by the administration of US President Donald Trump as it pursues its maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against its Mideast arch-nemesis Iran.

Citing three Iraqi officials and a source familiar with the matter, the news agency reported that US Charge d'Affaires in Baghdad Joshua Harris conveyed the warnings in conversations over the past two months with Iraqi officials from across its fractured political spectrum.

Iran relies closely on the banking sector its Western neighbor, where recent parliamentary polls kept Shi'ite Muslim parties in the ascendant and delivered gains for politicians from the kaleidoscope of militias and parties backed by Tehran.

The Islamic Republic's own economic lifeline of oil exports is under heavy pressure from US sanctions, even if export levels remain buoyant one year into Trump's second term, and Iraqi financial instruments help it skirt US curbs.

Following a 2003 US invasion, the United States has maintained de facto control over Iraqi oil revenues and its preponderant banking and financial puts the funds within its reach.

""The United States supports Iraqi sovereignty, and the sovereignty of every country in the region,"" Reuters quoted a US State Department spokesperson as saying in response to a request for comment. ""That leaves absolutely no role for Iran-backed militias that pursue malign interests, cause sectarian division, and spread terrorism across the region.""

US warnings also broached cutting off engagement with Baghdad if 58 members of parliament Washington views as linked to Iran are elevated by Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani to cabinet positions.

""The American line was basically that they would suspend engagement with the new government should any of those 58 MPs be represented in cabinet,"" Reuters quoted an Iraqi officials as saying.

""They said it meant they wouldn't deal with that government and would suspend dollar transfers,"" the source added.

Forming the new cabinet is due to take months and the US moves did not appear to be linked to a recent deadly crackdown on protestors in Iran, which resulted in new US sanctions on Iranian officials and oil shipping networks.

Machado said Iran and Venezuela were bound by deep cooperation between their rulers, even as people in both countries rise up against repression.

“The Iranian people, the Venezuelan people, we are fighting the same struggle,” she said. “These regimes have been cooperating for many years, exchanging resources, information, technology, agents and weapons.”

She said authoritarian governments help each other bypass pressure and maintain control, while democracies often stop at statements.

“Dictators help each other, they exchange technology, resources, they help each other bypass sanctions and they support each other in international forums,” Machado said. “Democratic governments stay at statements and declarations that at the end do not serve the people.”

Machado said people in Iran had reached a breaking point and were calling on the world to respond.

“We reach a point where the people start asking the world to react and to support,” she said. “What we are asking for is to stop the killings and to save lives.”

She criticized what she described as double standards among democratic governments that condemn repression while maintaining economic ties.

“You sign declarations talking about freedom and equality and respect for human rights, then you do business with these regimes,” Machado said. “You buy oil from these regimes and you keep their assets and resources in your own financial systems.”

Praise for Trump action

Machado praised Donald Trump for taking decisive action against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and said it showed what firm leadership could achieve.

“Finally in Venezuela we’re seeing President Trump making a tremendous important decision,” she said. “Bringing a criminal to justice is precisely what the world needs.”

She said the move sent a signal beyond Venezuela.

“It has brought a lot of hope,” Machado said. “This is a milestone.”

Machado said repression continues when dictators see little cost in using force.

“When you’re dealing with criminals, the only way they will leave is when the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving,” she said.

She said opposition movements cannot succeed alone without coordinated international pressure.

“We have done everything that any civic movement can do and they are killing us,” Machado said. “What we are asking for is applying law enforcement and cutting the resources they use to fund repression.”

Machado said the fall of Iran’s ruling system would have consequences far beyond the country.

“Imagine how the world will look once the Iranian criminal regime falls,” she said. “This is a unique moment in history.”

She said cooperation among opposition groups and diasporas was essential.

“These regimes help each other, and we the people need to connect and coordinate,” Machado said. “Regardless of how far away we are, we are united in this aspiration.”

“I can only speak for myself. I don’t need any more reminding about how bad this regime is and that somebody better do something about it, because if it’s not us, nobody’s going to do anything about it,” Levin said.

Levin said recent reports of increased US military deployments to the region suggested Washington was keeping its options open, although he said he had no insight into whether military action was being considered.

“Most revolutions, including America’s own, needed outside help,” he said. “What is happening in Iran is a counter-revolution against a regime that rules by force and fear.”

Levin also criticized decades of US engagement with Tehran, arguing that successive administrations believed the Islamic Republic could be managed through negotiations.

“This is an ideological regime,” he said. “They talk, they negotiate, but they have no intention of abandoning their mission, and that is why they so brutally suppress their own people.”

Iran has faced widespread internet disruptions during renewed unrest, with only limited information reaching the outside world through satellite connections and virtual private networks.

“I can tell you that tens of millions of Americans stand with the people of Persia. There’s no question about it,” Levin said. “We know the regime there is Hitleresque, Nazi-like. The regime is slaughtering innocent people, especially young people, raping them, and pillaging towns. We know that regime is the enemy of the American people. They’ve made that abundantly clear.”

Iran International has reported that at least 12,000 people have been killed since the protests began, while CBS News has cited estimates placing the death toll as high as 20,000.

Sources told Iran International on Wednesday that hospitals and morgues are facing shortages of body bags, forcing authorities to store bodies in corridors and other areas.

“We know they still want to build nuclear weapons. They back terrorism in our country, throughout Europe, and across the Middle East, but the people they terrorize the most are the Persian people,” Levin said. “I feel horrible about what’s taking place, and all I can do is use my platforms to draw as much attention to this as I can.”

Levin said Iranians possess a long civilizational history distinct from other countries in the region and said those who emigrate to the United States often integrate successfully and contribute to American society.

“If the people of Iran were free, the contributions they could make to science, culture, and technology would be extraordinary,” he said. “Instead, they are focused on survival under repression.”","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/7eea978ab07f845b332619a09d88a117c583a2f9-1920x1005.jpg?rect=3,0,1914,1005&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2026-01-25 11:58:11.735759

The US president’s sabre-rattling may also have shaken the faith of his own Republican party.

Trump’s fleeting threat to conquer the Danish territory prompted the most strident Republican opposition to anything he has done since taking office a year ago. It came on the heels of challenges to his authority over military powers, healthcare legislation and the Jeffrey Epstein files.

The mini-rebellion suggests that a small but vocal minority of Republicans feel increasingly emboldened to speak out against a 79-year-old leader who, for all his dominance of the party, is polling dismally and could drag them down in November’s midterm elections.

“You’ve never had a president with this much influence and this much political and legislative success so in that sense he’s winning but his own party is starting to question and wonder out loud at what cost?” said Frank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster. “He has been the most influential president since Franklin Roosevelt but the public and even people in his own party are starting to wonder whether it’s too much.”

Speculating over Trump’s grip on the Republican party, and whether it shows any sign of slipping, has been a political sport for a decade, producing many false dawns along the way. Dissenting senators and representatives such as Liz Cheney have been ruthlessly purged or made to feel they have no alternative but retirement.

Trump’s biggest crisis came with his crushing defeat in the 2020 presidential election and a subsequent insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the US Capitol, prompting even loyalists such as Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy to condemn him. But not even an attempted coup was enough to break the party’s cult-like fever.

Much-hyped pretenders to the crown such as the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, could not compete and, when Trump roared back from four criminal cases to win the 2024 presidential election, Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives and Senate and felt vindicated in sticking with their idol.

For much of Trump’s first year in office they gave the president such free rein on government downsizing, immigration enforcement and trade tariffs that critics said Congress had abdicated its responsibility, in effect setting up Trump as a monarch.

But there have been blips. In November four House Republicans – Marjorie Taylor Greene, Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace – took a rare stand against Trump by signing a discharge petition to force a vote to release federal files related to sex offender Epstein.

Despite months of lobbying against the release, Trump abruptly changed course and announced his support for the bill after it became clear the vote would succeed with potentially dozens of Republicans joining Democrats in support.

Greene, once among Trump’s staunchest allies, resigned from Congress and accused the president of betraying his “America First” base and prioritising elites over his supporters’ concerns. In a New York Times Magazine profile, she described herself as “naive” for initially believing Trump was a true “man of the people”.

Earlier this month more than a dozen House Republicans defied leadership by voting for a Democratic bill to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years without any restrictions. The party has also been scrambling in both chambers to narrowly fend off war powers resolutions intended to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in military action overseas.

Meanwhile Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year’s Republican incumbents, has criticised “excessive” tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.

Tara Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, perceived fractures. “I don’t think it’s as ironclad as it once was, evidenced by the Massies and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes and a few others who have begun to question the America First commitment of Donald Trump. Before, you wouldn’t have seen any of that; now you’re starting to see pockets of it.”

She added: “Whether that’s culminates into a larger rebellion remains to be seen because it is a midterm election year and these politicians want to stay in office so they’re going to continue to watch how the public reacts to Donald Trump’s decision-making and behaviour, which has been rather alarming and erratic. He’s showing signs of wear, his age – all of those things combined are becoming more difficult for rank-and-file Republicans to defend and the polling shows that.”

Few Republicans publicly dissented from the successful operation to capture Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela and many actively cheered it. But Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about seizing Greenland – threatening tariffs on European allies and refusing to rule out taking it by force – was seen by some as a bridge too far.

The Republican senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats on a bipartisan trip to Denmark. Other Republicans took part in meetings in Washington with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.

Murkowski and others pushed legislation that would prohibit Pentagon funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other Nato members without their consent. On the Senate floor, the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned that any attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies” and tarnish Trump’s legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.

Tillis directed his criticism at Trump advisers such as the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, rather than the president himself. “The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.

The most outspoken was Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, who told the Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump’s impeachment – something he would “lean” towards supporting.

It was notable, however, that McConnell, Tillis and Bacon have all announced that they will retire at the end of their current terms and therefore had little to lose by alienating Trump. Indeed the number of Republicans who broke ranks was perhaps less striking than the number who remained silent.

Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Given the gravity of Trump’s behaviour and the global consequences of his decision-making just in the last few weeks, the fact that there hasn’t been a Republican rebellion once again speaks volumes about the cowardice that got us into this position in the first place.

“He has to be reined in and the only people who can rein him in are the Republicans in Congress. Even with them facing electoral slaughter in November, they have yet to come together and work with Democrats to rein in Donald Trump.”

An Emerson College national poll this week found that 43% of likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing while 51% disapprove. Looking ahead to the midterms, 48% support the Democratic candidate on the generic congressional ballot and 42% plan on voting for the Republican candidate.

Trump himself is barred by the constitution from running for president again. Several shops that sell Trump campaign merchandise have recently announced that they are closing down. Next year the Republican political conversation will inexorably turn to the search for his successor, rendering him a lame duck with diminishing influence over the party.

Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “I don’t see a lot of evidence that many Republicans are willing to break publicly with him. But there’s clearly a sense of unease spreading in Republican ranks as they contemplate running for election or re-election in an environment defined by increasing public discontent with the Trump presidency as revealed by all the standard indices.

“If the traditional relationship between presidential approval and the party’s fortunes in the midterm elections holds true then the Republicans are in for a rough November. They know that. They can’t break with the president but they can subtly distance themselves from him and I suspect that, unless the president’s numbers pick up substantially, that is exactly what they’re going to do.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eadc4d8d78059979bb5e63463343742ee27deb55/720_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab0747aa4db9eafa5b59b67e7b32a32f",N,,2026-01-25 09:57:47.943177

Most people in the Great Room of Moscow’s 1912 Center raised their hands when asked if they, their parents or their grandparents were born in another country.

That’s how Joann Muneta, chair of the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, opened Saturday’s talk, “Immigration: An American Experience,” at the group’s 33rd annual human rights breakfast honoring Martin Luther King Jr.

The event, which filled to capacity with attendees joining both in-person and via Zoom, also featured the presentation of the 2026 Rosa Parks Achievement Awards and music by Gefilte Trout.

But Raquel Reyes, the event’s keynote speaker and director of programs and operations for PODER of Idaho, a Latinx advocacy group, posed her own question.

“Is it your experience, or are you finally being exposed to what we live with on a daily basis?” Reyes asked the majority-white crowd. “For the allies trying to save us, trying to deter the enforcement of these unlawful policies, I appreciate that. But it’s not your experience.”

Reyes recounted heart-wrenching stories: her father helping his mother and younger siblings cross the Rio Grande on inflatable tubes; the border barring her Apache grandfather from freely visiting ancestral lands; the father of her children seized and sentenced to three years detention; the daily blessing she gives her undocumented husband with the hope he comes home safe every night.

“The border crossed our family, we didn’t cross the border,” Reyes said. “We have to fight the propaganda that convinces communities that immigrants are dangerous and must be deported.”

Just minutes before the breakfast began, news broke that Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, died after being shot by a U.S. Border Patrol officer. Pretti was the third person shot, and second killed, by federal officers in 17 days as anti-immigration enforcement protests continue in Minneapolis.

The shootings have enhanced fears that legal residents and citizens are not safe from President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

For Reyes, who was born in Los Angeles and whose family has always been a mix of citizens, legal residents and undocumented immigrants, this fear is nothing new.

“We have people doing it the right way, but they’re still being detained and deported and arrested and held in detention centers,” Reyes said. “We have to fight back.”

To change the climate in our country, Reyes said, voting in every single election is critical.

“We can register voters endlessly, but the real difference is made when they actually go to the polls,” Reyes said. “Start a carpool. Get people to vote. Educate and inform them. It’s not political, it’s humanity. Being humane – we’ve lost that in America.”

Reyes also called on the crowd to make their voices heard.

“I need you to call our legislators, to write letters, to email them. Everything you can do to let them know their constituents are not happy. Until we really push back, nothing is going to change in Idaho,” Reyes said. “I’m brown. They don’t want to hear me, but they will listen to you.”

The Human Rights Task Force will post a recording of the event on its website at humanrightslatah.org.

Family of man killed by agent slams Trump administration's 'sickening lies'

The family of Alex Pretti on Sunday released a statement in which they expressed their grief and anger over his killing, saying they were ""heartbroken"" and describing Pretti as a ""kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,"" adding, ""Alex wanted to make a difference in this world.""

The Trump administration, as was the case in the January 7 killing of unarmed US citizen Renee Good by ICE officers, has asserted that Pretti was a left-wing radical bent on ambushing and killing as many officers as possible. The authorities have not provided evidence to back the claim.

In turn, the family said Pretti's final act was ""to protect a woman"" who was being manhandled by ICE agents.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,"" they said.

""Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.""

Despite these references to ICE, Pretti was in fact shot by the US Border Patrol agent. This agency is typically active in areas close to the border, but has been working increasingly close with its sister agency, ICE, under the current Trump administration, leading to both agencies being deployed in Minneapolis.

The family ended its statement with a plea: ""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

What do we know about Minneapolis shooting victim Alex Pretti?

The man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Saturday, 37-year-old US citizen Alex Jeffrey Pretti, was an intensive care unit nurse at a local veteran affairs hospital, according to his family and colleagues.

A hospital colleague of Pretti's, Dimitri Drekonja, who heads the Infectious Diseases Section, called him ""a good kind person who lived to help.""

In a post on the Bluesky social media platform, he said Pretti worked ""to support critically ill Veterans.""

Pretti's father was cited by The Associated Press as saying that his son had been deeply disturbed by the actions of federal immigration officials in Minneapolis, and had taken part in anti-ICE protests triggered by the death of another US citizen, Renee Good, in the city at the hands of a federal officer on January 7.

""He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests,"" Michael Pretti said.

AP's report said he was born in Illinois, and was an avid lover of outdoor life.

His family saying his contact with law enforcement had previously been limited to a handful of traffic tickets.

Correction: A previous version of this entry stated that Pretti was shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, rather than a Border Patrol officer. This has now been corrected. We apologize for the error.

Democrats threaten shutdown after Minneapolis shooting

Wesley Dockery Editor

Several Democratic senators have said they will not pass upcoming federal government spending bills after the shooting of a second US citizen in Minneapolis by federal agents, meaning that a government shutdown next week has become increasingly likely.

The current funding for large parts of the federal government expires on January 31.

The funding, which would go partly to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Pentagon, has been passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives through September but will require Democratic support to get through the 100-member Senate with the required majority of 60 votes.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Saturday that ""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.""

Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from the state of Nevada was one of those who said they would vote against the funding for the DHS.

She accused the Trump administration and DHS chief Kristi Noem of ""putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability.""

Another Democratic senator, Mark Warner of Virginia, also said he would not approve the DHS funding following the shooting death in Minneapolis.

""I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities,"" he wrote on a post on X.

The last government shutdown, the longest in US history at 43 days, ended only in November.

Such shutdowns mean that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed, with only those deemed essential being asked to work on without pay.

Bondi blames Minneapolis's sanctuary city policies after second fatal shooting of resident

US Attorney General Pam Bondi has echoed the White House's line that Minnesota's authorities and their immigration policies have to do with the shooting that killed a Minneapolis man, Alex Pretti.

Speaking during an interview with Fox News, Bondi said the unrest in the city was ""because you have a mayor, you have a governor who has declared Minneapolis a 'sanctuary city.'""

A sanctuary city is a loosely defined term referring to a municipality that limits its cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law.

Proponents of the approach say sanctuary cities help build community trust and improve public safety, while critics argue that they undermine federal law and encourage illegal immigration.

Bondi claimed that Minnesota was stopping ICE from detaining immigrants who have allegedly been charged with violent crimes.

What Pam Bondi said

""Federal law enforcement agents are doing heroic work to remove the worst of the worst in Minnesota — and they’re only there in the first place because of [Minnesota Governor Tim] Walz, [Minnesota Attorney General Keith] Ellison, and [Minneapolis Mayor Jacob] Frey’s dangerous sanctuary policies,"" Bondi posted on X.

She aaccused the state's leaders of ""creating the conditions for violence against law enforcement."" ""NOTHING will stop us from enforcing the law — and NOTHING will stop President Trump from protecting the good people of Minnesota,"" Bondi said.

During the interview with Fox News, Bondi said the Justice Department had sent a ""very strong letter"" to Walz, in which she told him he ""better support President Trump, he better support the men and women in law enforcement, because if he doesn't, we are.""

There have been daily clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Minnesota since Good was killed

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard to assist local police amid growing protests in the city after the fatal shooting of a man by immigration agents.

National Guard troops will be deployed to the site of the shooting in Minneapolis and the city's federal building.

In a post on X, Minneapolis authorities said the Guard was to be deployed as local police resources ""are already stretched thin because of public safety disruptions federal immigration agents have caused.""

Minneapolis city authorities added that Guard troops would wear neon vests to ""distinguish them from other agencies.""

Local officials said the deployment comes ""at the request"" of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Maine governor demands Trump withdraw 'reckless' ICE agents from state

The governor of the state of Maine, Janet Mills, issued a statement saying she is ""appalled and heartbroken"" by ""yet another killing at the hands of federal immigration enforcement.""

Mills said President Donald Trump's and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem's ""weaponization of federal law enforcement"" is both a ""grave violation of the Constitution"" as well as a ""threat to the lives of law-abiding people in the cities and states they occupy, including Maine.""

The DHS said Friday that ICE agents had arrested over 100 ""illegal aliens"" since a federal immigration crackdown began three days earlier in the state.

In her statement, Mills said she had requested a meeting with Trump to demand the withdrawal of ""these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave danger to public safety.""

She also urged Congress to cut off funding for ICE and to ""immediately"" bring Noem before a public hearing.

Noem blames Tim Walz, Jacob Frey for ongoing clashes after today's shooting

More now from Kristi Noem, who said ""about hundreds"" of protesters showed up at the scene after the shooting.

""They began to construct and assault law enforcement officers,"" Noem said, adding that they threw objects, ""including ice,"" at the agents.

""An agent's finger was bitten off,"" Noem claimed.

The DHS secretary then blamed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for encouraging violence against law enforcement officers.

""The Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor need to take a long, hard look in the mirror,"" Noem said. ""They need to evaluate their rhetoric, their conversations, and their encouragement of such violence.""

Noem said Walz had said the officers were ""not law enforcement, which is a lie; he has called them the Gestapo, he has encouraged residents and citizens and violent rioters to resist.""

While Walz has likened the federal immigration agents to a ""modern-day Gestapo,"" the governor has repeatedly urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully. The Gestapo was the official secret police of Nazi Germany.

Noem also accused Walz of refusing ""to turn over murderers to federal law enforcement officers, he has protected illegal criminals and protected them from being brought to justice.""

She said that Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Frey, instead of cooperating with federal immigration enforcement, ""choose violence, choose to encourage the destruction of their city.""

""It appears they want this lawlessness to continue; it appears they want chaos to distract from the theft and fraud and corruption in this city,"" Noem said.

The White House has withheld millions of dollars in aid to daycare centers in Minnesota amid unproven allegations of fraud.

DHS says man shot dead aimed 'to kill law enforcement'

Kristi Noem, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has given a press conference in the wake of the shooting of a US citizen by federal officers in Minnesota.

Noem claimed that the man had ""approached US border patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun"" and had ""reacted violently"" when the officers tried to disarm him.

Noem said an agent, who was ""fearing for his life and the life of his fellow officers,"" fired ""defensive shots.""

""The suspect also had two magazines with ammunition in them that held dozens of rounds. He also had no ID,"" Noem continued.

""This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement,"" she said.

Clashing narratives

Noem's description of the incident appears to contradict several videos from the scene filmed by protesters that have been published on social media.

Those videos appear to show a man holding a phone to film the agents' operation and trying to intervene when they start shoving another person.

After multiple agents confront the man, he is wrestled to the ground, before several shots are fired.

At no point is the man seen pulling his weapon or aiming it at the officers.

Vice President Vance accuses local officials of not coordinating with federal officers

US Vice President JD Vance responded to the shooting in a post on X and said that when he visited Minneapolis this week, ""what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand.""

He accused local officials in Minnesota of ignoring requests from ICE agents to work with them.

Federal officials previously blocked state investigators from accessing evidence after an ICE official shot protester Renee Good, declaring that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

What have federal authorities said about the shooting?

Federal authorities have said that a 37-year-old man shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday morning had ""violently resisted arrest"" before his death.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said that the man had been armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun which led to a federal agent firing ""defensive shots.""

""This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,"" the statement read.

In a press conference later on Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino reiterated parts of the statement and added that the officer who carried out the shooting was a ""highly trained"" border patrol agent with 8 years of experience.

According to the account, the man approached officers as they were carrying out ""targeted"" immigration enforcement operations against a separate individual who they said was in the United States illegally.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump sought to portray the shooting as a ""cover-up"" for state fraud scandals without providing details on how the events could be linked in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Local and state officials cast doubt on federal account of shooting

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz cast doubt on the federal government's account of the shooting and insisted the state be allowed to carry out its own investigation into the incidents.

He accused federal agencies of trying to ""spin a narrative"" on the shooting ""before any investigation is done.""

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said that federal agencies had not provided details on the shooting with local police, but said that a purported video of the incident circulating on social media — which shows masked men who appear to be federal agents kicking and punching someone on the ground before gunshots are heard — ""speaks for itself.""

Man killed in Minneapolis shooting 37-year-old ICU nurse — report

Family members identified the man killed in a shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Saturday morning as a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veteran Affairs hospital, according to the Associated Press.

The report comes after Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said in a Saturday press conference that a 37-year-old man was killed, but declined to identify him.

The man's father was cited in the report as saying that his son was upset by the federal immigration enforcement crackdown in Minneapolis and had participated in anti-ICE protests following the killing of Renee Good by a federal officer on January 7.

The man was a US citizen born in the Midwestern state of Illinois, according to the report.

Minnesota officials had previously stated that the man was a Minneapolis resident and was believed to be a US citizen.

Family members cited by the report said that he owned a handgun and had a concealed carry permit for the state of Minnesota, but added that they had never known him to carry it.

The Department of Homeland Security said he had approached federal officers armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun before he was shot dead.

Local and state officials have disputed the account, with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accusing the federal government of ""spinning stories"" before an investigation is conducted.

But far-right groups have been responding favourably to the social media recruitment campaign, recirculating the posts on their own social media channels.
But when asked by U.S.-based media about its social media posts, DHS has denied it was referring to white supremacist material.","At first glance, there may not appear to be anything unusual about the social media posts that are part of the ongoing recruitment drive by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The posts, which encourage Americans to join ICE, use the same aggressively patriotic imagery that’s become a hallmark of the Trump administration’s online communications.

But to observers of the far-right, and to members of the far-right themselves, there is something else that is recognizable in the language of the posts.

""I would describe it as oddly very familiar as someone who has been looking at the white nationalist and neo-Nazi movement for nearly a decade now,"" said Hannah Gais, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Centre, a non-profit that monitors right-wing extremism.

""It's disturbing to see that coming from a government agency.""

Gais is among several U.S. ex perts tracking a series of references in the ICE recruitment posts that, while obscure to most, seem to be wink ing to extremists.

That’s raised the question: Who, exactly, is ICE trying to recruit?

Invoking non-fiction book popular with neo-Nazis

In the year since returning to power, U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen a dramatic expansion to ICE, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for enforcing immigration within the country.

Trump has set a goal of deporting one million people per year. But as ICE has ramped up arrests, it has been repeatedly accused of racially profiling suspected immigrants and using excessive force in its operations.

Under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed last summer, ICE was given $8 billion US to hire thousands more agents. T he ensuing recruitment drive included social media outreach.

On Aug 11, 2025, ICE posted an image on its socials of Uncle Sam at a crossroads. It included the tag line ""Which way, American man?""

The post echoed a meme popular among right-wing influencers, who use the phrase ""Which way, Western man?"" to illustrate a choice between an image meant to represent liberal values and an image representing their own preferred option.

But the phrase itself is taken from the title of a 700-page antisemitic nonfiction book written by William Gayley Simpson and published by a neo-Nazi press in the late 1970s.

The book has long been a favourite among white supremacists.

Using white supremacist anthem

By itself, the language could have been chalked up to an unfortunate coincidence. But other troubling posts soon followed.

In October, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, posted an image of George Washington on horseback with the URL to the ICE recruitment page. This time the tag line read ""America for Americans.""

It’s a slogan that was used in a xenophobic speech by President Theodore Rosevelt in 1916, before being picked up by the Klu Klux Klan, according to America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States by Harvard history professor Erika Lee.

Not long after, DHS borrowed imagery from the popular video game Halo, writing ""destroy the flood"" atop an armed vehicle.

In the world of the video game, the flood refers to a parasitic alien lifeform. It’s also reminiscent of the language far-right groups use to describe non-white immigrants, according to Gais.

Most recently, in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, ICE put out a recruitment post emblazoned with the line ""We’ll have our home again.""

On Instagram the post first appeared with a clip from a song of the same name by the Pine Tree Riots.

""It is a song only known in white nationalist circles,"" said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.

Since 2020, the song has been circulated on the messaging app Telegram almost exclusively by accounts linked to far-right extremists, according to analysis by Open Measures, a research firm that specializes in online extremism.

With lyrics about replacement by foreigners, Beirich says the song is only popular in white nationalist spaces. ""This is the kind of thing that I can't find to be a mistake,"" she said.

'Message received,' say Proud Boys

ICE says it received around 220,000 applications during its recruitment drive last year, and hired 12,000 new officers, more than doubling the size of its force.

Beirich wonders how many of those applicants were drawn by the controversial social media posts.

""The most dangerous part is that this is probably attracting white supremacists and other racial extremists to perhaps join the ranks of ICE. And that is a very toxic, very dangerous situation if it's happening,"" she said.

There have been no recent reports of extremists infiltrating the ranks of ICE. But far-right groups have been responding favourably to the social media recruitment campaign, recirculating the posts on their own social media channels.

A Proud Boys chapter reposted the ""We’ll have our home again"" ad next to a picture of a literal dog whistle, adding the line ""message received.""

Another chapter also reposted the ad, commenting ""Hahah. If you know, you know.""

'Attracting the wrong type'

DHS did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News. But when asked by U.S.-based media about its social media posts, DHS has denied it was referring to white supremacist material.

A DHS spokesperson told The Associated Press that the ""We’ll Have Our Home Again"" post was ""a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.""

Its outreach on social media is only one part of a vast recruitment strategy by ICE.

The agency will spend $100 million US this year to target specific demographic groups, according to the Washington Post.

That includes using geo-tagging technology to deliver recruitment ads to people who attend, among other things, UFC fights and gun shows.

ICE has already spent millions running TV ads aimed at recruiting disgruntled law enforcement officers in sanctuary cities, which make public services available to undocumented immigrants.

""In sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,"" the ads say, adding ""Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst.""

David Lapan, a government communications specialist who was a DHS spokesperson during the first Trump administration, said the department appears to be trying to recruit applicants with a particular mindset.

Its messaging is appealing to people who “want to get rid of foreigners” and “bust some heads,” Lapan said.

""I think ICE is headed in the wrong direction in that they're attracting the wrong type of individual to be involved in a very serious mission that they have,"" he said.

ICE is slated to receive $30 billion by 2029 to fund its deportation efforts.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/7ba16152-63f6-4ef7-9f8a-a6bd1bb6da5b,1769206809294/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C329%2C4060%2C2283%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-25 11:58:19.141996

AAUW Camarillo stands in firm opposition to the harmful and discriminatory immigration enforcement practices carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

As a nonprofit committed to advancing gender equity for women and girls through research, education, and advocacy, we see the detrimental impact these actions are having across the county, specifically on women and their families. Masked agents without clear identification have violated constitutional rights to due process and have caused fear, disruption, and trauma across entire communities, trauma that will have longstanding consequences for all of us. ICE raids have had a chilling effect on community trust and well-being.

We call on local leaders to take immediate action:

Prohibit the use of masked or unidentified agents.

Enforce constitutional rights to due process.

Ensure that local law enforcement, in accordance with established city and county policies and the California Values Act (SB 54), will not assist with or participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws.

Take action to protect all individuals from acts of intimidation and aggression perpetrated by ICE agents.

Demand proof that Federal ICE agents employed by the Department of Homeland Security have undergone comprehensive training in use of force and lethal weapons.

We need to protect our coast

I am a junior in high school, the co-founder of Simi Valley High School’s Environmental Club, and a youth leader with Climate First: Replacing Oil & Gas (CFROG).

I am also, like many Ventura County residents, someone who loves going to the beach. When friends and family come to visit, the beach is always the first place I want to take them. This is why I was so concerned when I heard about the federal proposal for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program to open around 1.27 billion acres to new offshore drilling and create six new leases for sale off of California’s coast.

This is fueled by the passing of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” which requires a minimum of 36 oil lease sales through 2040. With the looming possibility of oil rigs dotting the waters only 3 miles off our shores, I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my family back to the beaches I grew up visiting.

We already know what could happen if this plan comes to fruition. In 1969, the infamous Santa Barbara oil spill polluted our ocean with 3 million tons of crude oil, causing environmental and economic devastation. The silver lining was that this spill spurred the first national Earth Day and an environmental movement that inspired real change. Because people came together to protect our oceans, the last federal oil lease sale in the Pacific was in 1984.

We must use our voices so that this work isn’t undone. I urge the people of Ventura County to submit comments at www.federalregister.gov/documents to protect our coast before the comment period for the Draft Proposed Program ends on Jan. 23.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from a Minnesota state representative.","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday that the state will conduct its own investigation into the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents.

The big picture: This is the second time this month local law enforcement said federal agencies have refused to cooperate while investigating the shooting death of a state resident by federal officials.

Driving the news: Walz said he told the White House Saturday morning that the state's justice system ""must have the last word"" because the ""federal government cannot be trusted to handle the investigation.""

A Justice Department spokesperson told Axios that the Department of Homeland Security will lead the investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

The latest: The 37-year-old Minneapolis resident's death has further inflamed tensions over ICE's continued presence and conduct in the state.

Walz and other officials immediately called on the Trump administration to remove the thousands of immigration agents that have flooded the state in recent weeks.

The president responded with a Truth Social post accusing the mayor and governor of ""inciting Insurrection"" with their rhetoric.

What he's saying: Walz pointed to videos taken at the scene as he dismissed the administration's initial accounts of the fatal encounter as ""nonsense"" and ""lies.""

""Thank God we have video, because according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them,"" he said, accusing federal officials of ""spinning stories"" and ""rushing to judgment.""

""They're telling you not to trust your eyes and ears.""

What we know: Videos from the scene appear to show the man recording agents with a phone and attempting to help another observer as she was pushed to the ground by an agent.

He was sprayed with chemical agents and wrestled to the ground by about half a dozen agents before multiple shots rang out.

The Department of Homeland Security said the man was armed with a gun and that a Border Patrol agent opened fire as the man resisted agents' attempts to disarm him.

Videos circulating so far do not appear to show the man reaching for or brandishing the firearm in question.

Friction point: The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said on X that its investigators were ""blocked"" from the scene this morning by federal agents.

Department of Public Safety commissioner Bob Jacobson told reporters that DHS ""pulled out of the scene,"" and that his agents and officers had to leave for their own safety as the crowd of protesters grew.

State Rep. Marion Rarick, a Republican, implored federal agencies to cooperate with the local investigation.

""Honor federal search warrants. Bring peace to the chaos of our state. Bring full transparency. Bring truth. Follow the constitution. Respect everyones' rights,"" she wrote on Facebook.

Zoom out: Federal officials also blocked state investigators from accessing evidence after an ICE official shot protester Renee Good in early January, declaring that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

Local prosecutors pledged to continue to pursue their own probe in that case.

What we're watching: Minnesota Guard Commander Shawn Manke said the guard, which Walz put on standby earlier this week, has been activated to help local law enforcement provide security at a federal immigration building.

More troops remain prepared to respond throughout the metro if the situation escalates, he said.

Federal immigration agents shot and killed a Minneapolis nurse Saturday morning, marking the second fatal shooting by federal officers in the city this month and triggering a rapid cascade of court action, political condemnation, and a brewing budget crisis in Congress as Senate Democrats moved to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

The man killed, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record who worked as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti had a permit to carry a firearm, which is legal in Minnesota, but emphasized that bystander video shows Pretti holding a phone — not a weapon — at the time federal agents took him to the ground and opened fire.

Video verified by multiple news organizations shows several federal agents surrounding Pretti, forcing him to his knees, restraining him on the ground and striking him before at least two agents fired. In the footage, one agent appears to pull a gun from the scrum while another unholsters his weapon and fires into Pretti’s back at close range. At least 10 shots were fired within roughly five seconds. Pretti collapses and lies motionless as shots continue.

Federal officials say the shooting occurred during a “targeted operation” in Minneapolis connected to immigration enforcement efforts under the Trump administration.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official overseeing the operation, said agents were searching for a man accused of domestic assault and other charges, but acknowledged that Pretti was not the target of the operation.

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the shooting began after Pretti approached agents while armed and that officers perceived him as a threat. Noem said federal agents believed Pretti intended to harm law enforcement.

A senior Border Patrol official described the situation as involving a potential “massacre.”

Those accounts are sharply disputed by eyewitnesses, medical professionals, and sworn declarations filed in federal court within hours of the killing.

In a declaration submitted as part of ongoing litigation challenging federal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, a physician who witnessed the shooting from their apartment said they did not observe Pretti brandish a weapon or pose an immediate threat to agents.

The doctor stated that they rushed outside in freezing conditions to provide medical assistance, identified themselves as a physician, and initially found federal agents not administering medical aid.

The doctor’s declaration describes multiple gunshot wounds, including several to Pretti’s back, and states that federal agents initially blocked or delayed efforts to render emergency care. The physician said they attempted CPR after eventually being allowed access.

Another civilian witness, who was recording video from just feet away, stated in a sworn declaration that Pretti had approached agents with a phone and camera, not a gun, and that federal officers escalated the encounter. That witness said agents forced Pretti to the ground and shot him repeatedly while he was restrained.

Beyond the killing itself, the court filings describe federal agents preventing state and local authorities from securing the crime scene and interviewing witnesses.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security blocked BCA investigators from accessing the scene even after a search warrant was obtained. Evans said that in more than 20 years with the agency, he had never encountered federal authorities barring state investigators from a scene involving concurrent jurisdiction.

Within hours, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty filed a new federal lawsuit challenging the federal government’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation.

That same evening, U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud issued a temporary restraining order barring federal agencies from destroying or altering any evidence related to Pretti’s killing and scheduled a follow-up hearing.

The shooting has also been folded into an existing federal case challenging “Operation Metro Surge,” a Trump administration immigration enforcement initiative operating in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Plaintiffs in that case argue the operation violates First and Fourth Amendment protections and sought emergency relief after the killing.

Attorneys for Minnesota, Minneapolis, and St. Paul asked the court to halt the operation entirely, warning that if left unchecked it would continue to cause irreparable harm.

Pretti’s parents, who said they learned of their son’s death when a reporter called them, issued a statement condemning what they described as “sickening lies” told by the administration about their son. They described Pretti as kindhearted and said he had been trying to help members of his community.

The killing reignited protests in Minneapolis, where tensions had already been high following the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, 37, who was shot in the head by a federal immigration officer earlier this month. That shooting also prompted demonstrations and demands by city and state officials for federal agents to leave the city.

Political fallout spread quickly beyond Minnesota. California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of escalating federal violence, writing on social media that “Trump made a shooting happen” and calling the federal presence in Minneapolis a “violent occupation.”

Newsom urged Californians to report abuses by ICE and Customs and Border Protection to the state attorney general’s office.

U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff said the killing was another “senseless loss of life” and called for ICE agents to be removed from cities immediately.

Sen. Alex Padilla said the shooting did not make communities safer and only escalated tensions.

At the same time, the shooting triggered an unusual rupture with gun rights groups after Bill Essayli, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, posted online that approaching law enforcement with a gun carries a high likelihood officers would be legally justified in shooting.

The National Rifle Association condemned Essayli’s comment as “dangerous and wrong,” saying public officials should wait for full investigations rather than demonize law-abiding gun owners.

Gun Owners of America said federal agents are not “highly likely” to be legally justified in shooting concealed carry permit holders and warned that treating the presence of a firearm as justification for lethal force undermines constitutional rights.

Essayli later said his remarks were mischaracterized and claimed he was referring only to armed agitators refusing to disarm, but the backlash underscored fractures between the administration’s enforcement posture and traditional gun rights advocates.

In Congress, the political consequences escalated into a potential budget crisis. Senate Democrats announced they would refuse to provide the votes needed to advance legislation funding the federal government if it includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called what was unfolding in Minneapolis “appalling” and “unacceptable in any American city,” saying Democrats would block the measure unless DHS funding was separated. The legislation includes billions for DHS and roughly $10 billion for ICE.

Several Democratic senators said they could no longer support funding ICE amid repeated incidents of violence.

Sen. Mark Warner said he would not vote to fund DHS “while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said federal agents were being deployed without accountability and that the operation was “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Republicans acknowledged the funding deal was in jeopardy and began exploring whether DHS funding could be split off to avert a partial government shutdown.

Sen. Susan Collins said negotiations were ongoing but warned that rejecting the full package could jeopardize funding for multiple federal agencies.

As investigations proceed, federal officials have defended their actions as lawful and necessary, while state authorities, judges, medical witnesses, gun rights groups, and Democratic lawmakers have raised sharply different conclusions about what happened in Minneapolis and what it signals about federal power, accountability and the use of lethal force.

Hearings in multiple federal cases are scheduled in the coming days, and the killing of Alex Pretti now sits at the center of a widening legal and political confrontation that extends from a Minneapolis street corner to the halls of Congress.

5:50 p.m.: Susan Collins says Minnesota shooting ‘needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated’

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, released a statement Saturday responding to the fatal shooting of a man by ICE agents in Minneapolis, saying the incident “needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.”

“This shooting further underscores the importance of equipping federal law enforcement agents with training and body cameras for their safety and the safety of the public,” Collins said in the statement. “I urge protestors to keep space between themselves and law enforcement and not to interfere with operations.”

Collins also said it’s critical that “ICE and other federal law enforcement agents recognize both the public’s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.”

4:10 p.m.: Gov Mills requests meeting with Trump after fatal ICE-related shooting in Minneapolis

Gov. Janet Mills issued a statement Saturday afternoon demanding that President Trump withdraw federal immigration agents from Maine, after a fatal shooting in Minneapolis earlier the same day.

Mills also requested a meeting with the president.

“I am requesting that the President of the United States meet with me so that I can demand in person that his Administration withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety,” she said in the statement. “I call on Congress to immediately bring Secretary Noem before them for a public hearing and cut off any further funding for ICE until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a 37-year-old man was killed but declined to identify him. He added that information about what led up to the shooting was limited.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him. O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”

Mills said she was appalled at the violence in Minneapolis.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem’s weaponization of Federal law enforcement against the people they are meant to serve is not only a grave violation of the Constitution, but a threat to the lives of law-abiding people in the cities and states they seek to occupy, including Maine,” she wrote.

She encouraged Mainers to continue to protest peacefully.

“I am proud of Maine people for standing up in peaceful protest across our state and I continue to encourage peaceful protest as we show the world that we will always stand up for our values – support for the rule of law, due process, compassion, integrity, and justice. ”

4 p.m.: Attendance down at high school sports event as immigrant families stay away out of fear

Participation was down at Saturday’s morning track meet at the University of Southern Maine in Gorham, which featured teams from Portland, South Portland, Deering and Cheverus high schools.

Athletes whose families immigrated to the United States make up a significant portion of the rosters for the Portland, South Portland and Deering teams. Those teams had a number of athletes missing the meet on Saturday, likely related to the immigration enforcement actions this week.

Andy Schmidt, whose daughter Nora is a freshman distance runner on the Portland track team, took a video of one of Nora’s teammates running a sprint event.

“I was happy to film this race for my friend, who was too scared to come see her daughter compete, even though their family is here legally,” Schmidt said. “I understand we need to enforce immigration laws, but it doesn’t need to be this cruel.”

Adam Ramsell, whose son Caleb is a senior sprinter and jumper on the South Portland track team, said “attendance was way down” at Saturday’s meet, but it could have been even lower.

He said Caleb was one of the students who gave rides to team members who come from immigrant families. That helped minimize the chances those athletes would be targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while traveling to the meet, Ramsell said.

“It’s great to see kids stepping up, supporting and taking care of each other,” Ramsell said.

3:30 p.m.: ICE activities prompt cancelation of weekend puppet shows in Portland

Mayo Street Arts, a community performance venue in Portland’s East Bayside neighborhood, has canceled this weekend’s scheduled puppet shows due to ICE activities.

“We do not feel it is responsible to put international artists at risk,” the organization said in a Saturday afternoon email to members. “ICE is not welcome at MSA and we are implementing policies as best we can to keep our community and the artists that perform here safe.”

In the email, the center said it plans to reschedule the showings of The City That Slept, a story about a sleep-inducing deity wandering the streets of New York City by native New Zealander Tom Tuke, once circumstances in Portland have changed.

3 p.m.: American Legion allows ICE agents to park vehicles in its Scarborough parking lot

Reached at the post, which was in the midst of preparing for a luau celebration, American Legion Post 76 Commander Phil Caesar said he was allowing ICE agents who work at the Scarborough detention center next door to park personal vehicles in the post’s 15-space parking lot.

He said many of the agents appear to live in Scarborough and are veterans themselves.

It’s not like the two groups socialize or that members even talk, he said. It was all handled in one quick phone call, he said.

“They are a federal agency doing federally mandated work,” Caesar said. “We support ICE. That’s it.”

No one from the community or his own membership of a couple dozen have complained about the arrangement, he said.

Caesar said he thought Maine was wrong to refuse to follow federal immigration policies or interfere with ICE enforcement actions or condemn anyone for doing their job. That is why Caesar refused to allow protesters to stage an ICE protest in the post parking lot when asked last year, Caesar said.

Scarborough Democratic Town Councilor Jon Anderson said he is disappointed that the local American Legion post would allow its parking lot to be used by an organization whose recent actions violate people’s civil rights but not local residents who would exercise their free speech right to protest those violations.

Anderson said ICE’s use of the lot is proof the facility has expanded beyond its initial use as a transfer facility. In 2021, the town adopted a 2021 zoning ordinance to prevent any facility expansion, he said. Anderson said that he has asked the town manager to investigate if the facility is in violation of local zoning.

“If they’ve run out of space to park their cars, they’ve most likely expanded, which is exactly what the town took steps to avoid,” Anderson said. “Is the American Legion helping ICE violate our ordinance? I don’t know if there is such a thing as an accomplice to a zoning violation, but I would highly recommend the American Legion reconsider how they are using their land.”

1:50 p.m.: Maine’s congressional delegation begins to react to latest Minneapolis ICE-related shooting

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, discussed the latest shooting on her way to speak at the Lewiston rally on Saturday.

“My heart goes out to the family of the individual shot by ICE,” Pingree said on a message she posted to Facebook. “We have a good idea that this will be yet another unjustified killing.”

She said she was pleased the Minneapolis police would be investigating the incident so it would not be dismissed by ICE.

Pingree is likely to talk about the incident when addressing the crowd in Lewiston. “I’m so proud of Mainers for standing up and fighting for the rule of law,” Pingree said. “ICE needs to get out of our state.”

1:45 p.m.: Anti-ICE rally in Lewiston draws 1,000 protesters to Kennedy Park

LEWISTON — About 1,000 people overflowed the Angora Grand Event Center to protest the surge in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Lewiston and Maine this week.

Speaking at the protest were several local and state officials and candidates for office, including Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline; advocate and former Lewiston City Councilor Safiya Khalid; Portland Mayor Mark Dion; U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner; U.S. House District 2 candidates Matt Dunlap and Jordan Wood and gubernatorial candidates Hannah Pingree, Troy Jackson and Shenna Bellows.

Several religious leaders from Lewiston and beyond also spoke at the demonstration. Asked why she was at the rally, Lewiston resident Debbie Hillman said, “Things are terribly wrong and we need to get together.

“It’s not just one item that Trump has decided to pick, it’s this whole big umbrella of things and it’s frustrating and heartbreaking. This is emotional for me and I had to do something.”

11:15 a.m.: U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner ‘heartened’ by community opposition to ICE

U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner said he’s “heartened” to see the robust community opposition to a surge of federal immigration enforcement in Maine.

Earlier in the week, Platner urged residents to “actually fight back” against Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers through community organizing. He has accused ICE of terrorizing the community, rather than conducting a legitimate law enforcement operation.

On Friday night, hundreds of protesters marched along Congress Street and dozens of others beat on drums and blew whistles for the second straight night at hotels where ICE agents are believed to be staying.

“The rallies and the protests outside the hotels, of course, I support them immensely,” Platner said in an interview with the Press Herald on Saturday morning.

Platner said he’s proud of the rapid response teams that have formed organically in communities like Portland, Westbrook, Biddeford and Saco to record and document arrests being made by ICE agents and help people too fearful to leave their homes.

“The reason we’re seeing videos of these illegal arrests is because there are people on hand available to videotape them and then report what they’re witnessing,” Platner said. “People are doing this in their communities and then connecting with the greater networks. And I think that that’s something that we should all be proud of.”

Platner is seeking the Democratic nomination against two-term Gov. Janet Mills. The winner will take on Republican Sen. Susan Collins in the fall.

Platner is slated to speak at a rally in Lewiston this afternoon.

10:55 a.m.: More than 200 Maine faith leaders denounce ICE tactics

An open letter circulated by the Maine Council of Churches Friday condemned the tactics of ICE agents in the state. More than 200 faith leaders signed the letter, which called on ICE to end its targeting of immigrants and asylum seekers.

“Our sacred texts teach us to love the stranger and urge us toward empathy and welcome, not toward violence and bigotry,” the letter said. “Yet across our state, parents are afraid to pick up their children from school, workers are afraid to go to their jobs, and parishioners are afraid to walk home alone from worship services due to the discriminatory and unjust actions being perpetrated by ICE agents.

“This sort of terror is not welcome here. We denounce the current operation and call for its end.”

The letter encourages Mainers to report ICE activity to the statewide hotline, document incidents involving ICE agents and help the immigrant community access needed services.

10 a.m.: Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce offers advice to businesses dealing with “troubling” ICE disruption

The Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce said it has been closely following recent federal immigration enforcement activity and has heard concerns from members about how this activity is affecting their businesses.

“The manner and scope of recent immigration enforcement actions are disrupting workplaces, undermining economic stability, and adversely affecting the well-being of residents,” the organization said. “This includes members of our much-valued immigrant community, who play a significant role in the success and vitality of Greater Portland’s economy.”

Businesses rely on employees who are here legally to be able to work without unnecessary uncertainty or stress, it said.

Here is what it told its business members in an email sent out Friday night:

Businesses should designate one person to interact with ICE officers. Employee eligibility forms should be complete and securely stored. Mark non-public workplace spaces. Train front-line staff to refer agents to managers. Keep legal counsel information readily available.

Employees should carry valid immigration documents, know they have the right to stay silent and ask for a lawyer, and not to volunteer information or sign documents they do not understand.

If agents show up, stay calm and act professionally. Do not resist or obstruct officers. Limit agents’ access to public areas unless they have a judicial warrant signed by a judge. Consult a lawyer before providing documents or answering questions. Employers have three business days to respond to a notice of inspection for employee eligibility forms and related records.

“We will continue to support our members and serve as a voice for the Greater Portland business community,” the agency told its members. “In the meantime, we encourage open and constructive dialogue among federal, state, and local leaders.”

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who had protested President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in his city. After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs.

The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, officials said. Guard troops were sent to both the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.

Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation and fired ""defensive shots"" after a man with a handgun approached them and ""violently resisted"" when officers tried to disarm him.

WATCH: Thousands brave frigid cold in Twin Cities 'ICE Out' protest

In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.

O'Hara said police believe the man was a ""lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.""

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Pretti had shown up to ""impede a law enforcement operation."" She questioned why he was armed but did not offer detail about whether Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.

The officer who shot the man is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.

Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out at Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.

Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: ""What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?""

Trump, a Republican, said the Democratic governor and mayor are ""are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.""

Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7, sparking widespread protests.

Pretti's family released a statement Saturday evening saying they are ""heartbroken but also very angry,"" and calling him a kindhearted soul who wanted to make a difference in the world through his work as a nurse.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,"" the family statement said. ""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

Video shows officers, man who was shot

In a bystander video of Saturday's shooting obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on Nicollet Avenue.

The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.

The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.

The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.

Soon at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man's back and another who appears to have a canister in his hand strikes a blow to the man's chest. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.

A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it's not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.

The police chief appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement.

""Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,"" the chief said. ""We urge everyone to remain peaceful.""

Gregory Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration's big-city immigration campaign, said the officer who shot the man had extensive training as a range safety officer and in using less-lethal force.

""This is only the latest attack on law enforcement. Across the country, the men and women of DHS have been attacked, shot at,"" he said.

Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and that the state would lead the investigation into the latest fatal shooting.

But Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the shooting scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

Amid the unrest, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will not vote for a spending package that includes money for DHS. Schumer's statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down on Jan. 30 when funding runs out.

Protests continue in Minneapolis

Protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather.

At midday Saturday, the worst of an extreme cold wave was over, but the temperature was still -6 degrees (-21 Celsius).

After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them ""cowards"" and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: ""Boo hoo."" Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car. Protesters dragged garbage dumpsters from alleyways to block the streets, and people who gathered chanted, ""ICE out now"" and ""Observing ICE is not a crime.""

As dark fell, hundreds of people gathered quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting. Some carried signs saying ""Justice for Alex Pretti."" Others chanted Pretti's and Good's names. A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.

Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration. ""It feels like every day something crazier happens,"" he said. ""What's happening in our community is wrong, it's sickening, it's disgusting.""

The age of the man who was shot has been corrected to 37, per information from the police chief. The AP previously reported his age as 51 based on a hospital record.

The incident was one of five shootings in January involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good. At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention, an unusually rapid pace.

The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement with $170 billion budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

Minneapolis has become the focus of the Republican president’s crackdown this month, with some 3,000 agents deployed. Thousands of protesters took to the streets despite sub-zero temperatures on Friday to voice opposition to Trump’s enforcement and demand he withdraw the agents, which Minnesota officials have called an occupation.

Trump has argued the militarized operations are necessary to remove criminals from the U.S., but many of those arrested were picked up solely for possible civil immigration violations - the legal equivalent to a traffic violation.

Here is a closer look at the deaths from federal immigration enforcement and the often-conflicting accounts of what happened in each case.

FATAL SHOOTINGS IN MINNESOTA

The man killed in Minneapolis on Saturday was a U.S. citizen, identified in news reports as Alex Pretti, 37, a registered nurse and lawfully permitted gun owner.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent fired at the man, who resisted agents' attempts to disarm him, but local leaders challenged that account.

In bystander videos verified by Reuters, agents are seen pepper spraying Pretti and other protesters as he films them with his cellphone. No weapon is visible. After multiple agents wrestle him to the ground, one draws his weapon and multiple shots can be heard.

The shooting followed Good’s death earlier this month, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle.

Within hours of that shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist” who tried to ram the ICE officer with her car, although the department has not presented evidence of a link to terrorism. Video shows Ross fired as Good's car moved past him.

ICE, BORDER PATROL FIRING AT SUSPECTS

Federal agents have been involved in three other shootings this month during immigration actions.

The day after Good’s death, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man and woman in Portland, Oregon, after what DHS called “a targeted vehicle stop.”

DHS said the driver, Venezuelan immigrant Luis Nino-Moncada, attempted to run over the agents before the agent fired, wounding Nino-Moncada and his passenger, a Venezuelan woman.

The Justice Department later charged Nino-Moncada with assaulting an officer. His passenger, Yorlenys Zambrano-Contreras, pleaded guilty this week to entering the U.S. illegally in 2023.

On January 15, an ICE agent shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg in Minneapolis after DHS said he fled authorities.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan immigrant, and two other men hit an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

DETENTION DEATHS RISE

At least six people have died in ICE detention centers since the start of 2026, following at least 30 deaths in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high.

The death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos has received the most scrutiny after federal authorities provided shifting accounts of what happened.

ICE initially said Lunas died on January 3 at a Trump-era detention camp on the grounds of a U.S. military base in Texas after experiencing ""medical distress.""

The medical examiner released a report this week that found the death was a homicide due to ""asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,"" the Post reported.

On January 14, two other immigrant detainees died: a Nicaraguan man found unresponsive in the military base site, called East Camp Montana, and a Mexican man found unresponsive in a Georgia detention center, according to ICE.

Both deaths remain under investigation, but ICE said the Nicaraguan man, Victor Manuel Diaz, was presumed to have committed suicide.

The other deaths occurred in Houston, Philadelphia, and Indio, California, ICE said.

Trump increased immigration detention to record levels, with 69,000 held as of early January, according to ICE statistics. Some 43% of the detainees picked up by ICE had no criminal charge or conviction, the figures showed.

The child's immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States.
The Trump administration last July issued a ""Detained Parents Directive"" that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE ""should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.""
The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America's divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as ""bait"" by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an ""abject lie."" It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family's attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

School officials say ICE used the boy as 'bait'

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, ""essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,"" she said.

The father told the child's mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn't leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

""Why detain a 5-year-old?"" the superintendent asked. ""You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.""

Other adults at the scene wanted to care for the boy

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

ICE denies what school officials and neighbors said

""ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as 'bait,'"" said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. ""ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ""

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. ""Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.""

The officers, she said, ""abided by the father's wishes to keep the child with him.""

Bovino and ICE officials criticize media coverage

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the ""false media narrative"" about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for ""abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle."" He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and ""did everything they could to reunite him with his family.""

""Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

Where are the father and son now?

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children's Rights, who visited the facility last week.

""The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,"" Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

""Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,"" Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

""I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,"" Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers ""get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.""

The family's lawyer was unable to reach them

The family's lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

""We're looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,"" he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch's office said he was unavailable to comment.

What is the Trump administration's policy on detaining children?

The child's immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn't, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

""This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,"" Homan said last year on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

The Trump administration last July issued a ""Detained Parents Directive"" that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE ""should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them."" The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

""If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child's immigration status,"" said Neha Desai, managing director at Children's Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. ""When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child's care.""

The man was later pronounced dead. This is just the latest incident of deadly violence involving ICE, which has grown increasingly frequent, especially on the streets of Minneapolis. It’s been less than three weeks since an agent murdered Renée Good on January 7th.

Just as in the case of the shooting of Good, video of the killing quickly started circulating online. Though I strongly urge readers to use their judgment before clicking through and pressing play. The video is upsetting and includes the graphic death of a human being.

Governor Tim Walz addressed the public in a conference this afternoon, insisting that the state’s justice system would “have the last word on this.” He harkened back to his earlier calls for citizens to “hit record” when they see ICE. “Minnesotans are witnessing, and we’re creating a log of evidence for the future prosecution of ICE agents and the officials responsible for this,” he said. “Thank god, thank god we have video.”

The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that ICE immediately tried to seize control of the situation by whisking witnesses off to the Whipple building, which has served as a base of operations and detention center during immigration raids in Minneapolis. ICE also attempted to order local police to leave the scene, but Chief Brian O’Hara refused to comply. The official X account of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also confirmed that their access to the crime scene was restricted by DHS agents, despite requests from local police for their assistance in investigating the shooting.

The Star Tribune is updating regularly as information comes in.

But in the hours after fatal shooting, several Democrats have come forward to announce their opposition, including some who had until now appeared ready to vote the funding package.
“The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.
We could beef up training and require identification,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose been pushing his colleagues to block DHS funding for weeks.
What’s unacceptable is the current lawless status quo.” Senate Democrats were expected to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their next steps.","In the wake of another fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minnesota by a federal officer, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said his party would block a funding package next week if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The announcement, which dramatically escalates the potential for another partial government shutdown, comes as anger towards homeland security, which oversees ICE, intensifies among the party after a group of federal agents violently restrained and then fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling – and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer, a New York senator, said in a statement. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no.”

“Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he added.

The Senate is set to take up the spending measure as part of a broader legislative package that would fund broad swaths of the government, including the defense, state , education, labor and transportation departments. That package, which currently calls for $64.4bn for the DHSincluding $10bn for ICE, needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans currently control 53 seats and would need Democratic support to pass the bipartisan package.

The looming vote was seen as a potentially painful decision for many Senate Democrats, wary of setting off another government shutdown just months after a painful 43-day fiscal showdown – the longest in the nation’s history – that ultimately failed to win an extension of healthcare subsidies.

But in the hours after fatal shooting, several Democrats have come forward to announce their opposition, including some who had until now appeared ready to vote the funding package.

“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” Nevada senator Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe. It’s brutalizing US citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Last year, Cortez Masto was one of a handful of Democrats who broke rank and voted repeatedly to keep the government open.

Jacky Rosen, Nevada’s other senator who had also bucked her party during the shutdown, wrote on X: “As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now. That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Mark Warner, a Democratic senator for Virginia, wrote: “I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

In a sign of Democrats’ fury, Washington senator Patty Murray, the ranking member on the appropriations committee, who negotiated funding package, announced she would not support the package as currently written.

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences. I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” she said on X. “The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that. I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

It was unclear if Senate Republicans were willing to separate the DHS funding measure from the rest of the package, which would likely win significant bipartisan support. On Saturday, many Republicans defended the agent and the department in the aftermath of the shooting.

Holding up the homeland security budget would not necessarily curtail the department’s enforcement operations, at least not in the short term. Trump’s 2025 domestic policy bill, known as the “big, beautiful bill”, included a $75bn supplement for ICE the agency could potentially tap if its funding lapsed.

But Democrats say they must use the threat to try to establish guardrails on federal immigration agents, whose increasingly violent tactics have fueled protests in cities across the US.

“We should not fund DHS without serious reform. We could return CBP to border. We could require warrants for immigration arrests. We could beef up training and require identification,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose been pushing his colleagues to block DHS funding for weeks. “The list of possible reforms is long. What’s unacceptable is the current lawless status quo.”

Senate Democrats were expected to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their next steps.

The funding bill narrowly passed the Republican-controlled House on Thursday, overcoming a Democratic revolt following the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Seven Democrats, however, helped nearly all Republicans move it over the line. Explaining their support, several of the Democrats sharply denounced ICE’s conduct in US cities, but argued that the funding bill contained hard-won concessions, including funding for body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE officers.

But Republicans rejected other proposals sought by Democrats, including measures that would have requires judicial warrants for home entries and a provision explicitly prohibiting funds from being used to detain or deport US citizens.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03898e706322e0f29a19b79d2185c78276b747ed/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f376cd0849c7d8b8cbe6d2b0486a8d53",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:14.761169

“Whoever goes to the United States Senate is going to have to be ready for real war.","Hours after federal immigration agents killed a man in Minneapolis, the top Democrats running for U.S. Senate in Texas appeared on a debate stage together and both called for overhauling Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Just minutes into the debate between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico, which was hosted by the Texas AFL-CIO and moderated by Nexstar’s KXAN-TV and The Dallas Morning News, Crockett referenced the shooting by Department of Homeland Security agents. She pointed to the incident to lay out the stakes of the race ahead of the March 3 primary.

“Listen, we are not looking at politics as usual. Just today, we just had another person gunned down in the streets in Minneapolis,” Crockett said. “And so for anyone that believes that we are going to be able to respond to this in a normal way, I think that they’ve got it wrong.”

Crockett and Talarico also agreed on a range of liberal positions as they fight to flip a Republican-leaning state, including saying that President Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses and that changing the makeup of the Supreme Court should be considered.

Crockett defended her recent vote against a DHS funding bill, saying, “There was no way I was going to continue to pump a historic amount of money into this rogue organization that is going out and is violating people’s rights every single day in American cities.”

“We absolutely have to clean house, whatever that looks like,” Crockett, who supports impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, later said when pressed on whether she would support defunding or abolishing ICE altogether.

Talarico, who also backed impeaching Noem, said it is time to “tear down” the agency.

“ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning,” Talarico said. “It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

Both candidates were also pressed on how they balance their views of ICE when Texas voters may support deporting undocumented immigrants, a nod to the politics of a state that Trump won by 14 points in 2024.

“They are supposed to do Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not going after U.S. citizens, not going after people that are documented. That is not what they are supposed to do, but that is what they are doing,” Crockett said. “They are turning us into Nazi Germany by saying they’re gonna go door to door. They are going after people because of their accent or the color of their skin because this Supreme Court gave them carte blanche ability to do so.”

Talarico pointed to his family’s roots in a Texas border town, calling for balancing border security with an immigration overhaul.

“Our southern border should be like our front porch. There should be a giant welcome mat out front and a lock on the door,” Talarico said. “We can welcome immigrants who want to live the American dream. We can build a pathway to citizenship for those neighbors who have been here, making us richer and stronger, and we can keep out people who mean to do us harm.”

Both candidates referred to immigration enforcement and the clashes in Minnesota, where protests have continued after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis earlier this month, in stark terms later in the debate.

Crockett accused Trump of “seemingly trying to plunge us not only into a civil war with ICE, but he’s also trying to plunge us into World War III,” referring to his foreign policy.

Talarico referred back to ongoing clashes in Minnesota during a discussion about potential military action in Iran, saying, “We can have discussions about how to respond in Iran, where we have seen so many innocent civilians, protesters murdered on their streets. We’re also seeing that in Minnesota as we speak.”

Both candidates sharply criticized the Trump administration as they compete to take on Republican Sen. John Cornyn in the traditionally red state, though Talarico suggested multiple times that state Attorney General Ken Paxton could be the GOP nominee. Cornyn, who is seeking a fifth term, is facing a tough primary fight against Paxton or Rep. Wesley Hunt.

Crockett reiterated her support for impeaching Trump, saying, “There is more than enough to impeach Donald Trump. Period.” She pointed to his tariff policy as one potential impeachable offense.

Talarico also said that “the administration has certainly committed impeachable offenses, particularly when it comes to using their public roles to enrich themselves,” but added that he would carefully examine all of the evidence and “vote my conscience,” as the Senate acts as the jury in an impeachment trial.

The debate revealed few policy differences between the candidates, but a handful of dividing lines emerged on their political strategy and their stances on issues like the Senate filibuster, corporate donations and Supreme Court reforms.

Crockett argued she is the more electable candidate in November, touting support among working-class, Black and female voters and suggesting she will more forcefully take on Trump.

“This is about whether or not we have the will,” Crockett said. “And right now, people are not happy with the Democratic Party. I’ve seen the polling. What they want is someone who is going to be unafraid in the face of what we are facing right now, which is someone who believes he’s a king.”

She took a rare swipe at Talarico, saying he is not as well known in the state despite his time in elected office.

“He’s not as known right now because I have engaged in these fights, and they have been right there on the front lines where people could see me out front,” Crockett said.

Talarico framed his campaign as a fight against billionaires, saying “the real fight in this country is not left versus right, it’s top versus bottom.”

“We have traveled to every corner of Texas because we’re not writing off any voter or any community, and we have shattered grassroots fundraising records without taking a dime of corporate PAC money,” Talarico later added.

Talarico called for banning corporate PACs and super PACs, and he defended past campaign donations to his state legislative campaign committee from a pro-gambling PAC funded by GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson. Talarico said he has never met Adelson and they are not aligned on most issues, but the donation was tied to his support for legalizing gambling in Texas.

Crockett also defended donations to her campaigns from a slew of corporate PACs, saying those donations are limited under federal law and that they come from employee contributions to the PACs. She also said she has used her own campaign funds to boost other Democratic candidates.

The candidates also appeared to take different stances on the 60-vote threshold to end debate in the Senate, known as the filibuster. Talarico has previously said he supports eliminating the filibuster, while Crockett suggested carveouts for certain issues like voting rights could be more feasible.

“There are not a lot of people on the Senate side that are going to say, ‘Hey, yes, let’s do it,’” Crockett said of eliminating the filibuster. “But I do think that we can get somewhere if we focus on looking at, historically, the fact that they have had these carveouts. And we need to make it for, at a very minimum, our fundamental issues.”

Crockett also voiced her support for expanding the Supreme Court, while Talarico said he would be “open” to the move. Talarico added that term limits for justices “can do just as much good” to reduce partisanship on the high court.

As they laid out their stances on a range of other issues including lowering costs, supporting unions and navigating artificial intelligence, Crockett and Talarico both talked about the high stakes of the U.S. Senate race in Texas.

“I have seen the consequences in the trenches of the Texas Legislature of losing elections. I’ve seen my constituents get hurt. I’ve seen rights that we took for granted rolled back. I’ve seen schools close. I’ve seen people not be able to access basic health care. So we have to win in November,” Talarico said.

Crockett said she has “been fighting on the front lines in this corrupt administration,” and she has faced death threats in the process.

“Whoever goes to the United States Senate is going to have to be ready for real war. This is how bad it is,” Crockett said, later adding: “I am here to tell you that it is life or death, as we see what is happening in Minnesota and otherwise.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260123-crockett-talarico-debate-bf-1111-ba257b.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:23.050737

They said, without evidence, that Pretti was looking to “massacre law enforcement.” Analysis of videos of the incident by media organizations such as The New York Times found the evidence contradicted that version of events, as Pretti approached the with only his phone and his firearm was holstered and concealed until after the agents had forcefully brought him to the ground.

As a VA nurse, Pretti was a member of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. AFGE President Everett Kelley said Pretti ""dedicated his life to serving American veterans.""

“Our union is heartbroken,” Kelley said. “An AFGE member is dead. And a family’s life has been forever changed.”

Kelley blamed President Trump’s policies for creating the environment in which Pretti’s death occurred, though he encouraged his members to demonstrate restraint.

“I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry,” Kelley said. “Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm.”

The Trump administration was quick to denounce Pretti despite his work for the administration and with veterans, with Homeland Security Department Secretary Kristi Noem quickly labeling him a domestic terrorist. VA did not respond to a request for comment. Records indicate Pretti worked for VA since at least 2016.

Pretti’s death marked the third shooting by federal law enforcement in Minnesota in recent weeks. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good, who was protesting the agency’s enforcement activities from her vehicle. Officers shot another man who was fleeing his attempted arrest.

Doug Massey, president of the AFGE chapter that represents employees in VA's headquarters, said the pain of Pretti's death would be widespread.

“Alex…was known by colleagues, friends, and family as a compassionate caregiver who was deeply committed to helping others,” Massey said. “His senseless death is a profound loss to his loved ones, his patients, and our union family.”

The shooting could have further implications for federal employees: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in response to the shooting that his party would not agree to a six-bill funding package next week if it contains DHS appropriations. Half of the 12-annual must pass spending bills for fiscal 2026 have already cleared Congress, but the remaining six are still pending before the Senate. The House already approved them.

In addition to DHS, those measures would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies. They are currently operating under a stopgap continuing resolution that is set to expire Jan. 30. Lawmakers could opt to fund just those agencies and negotiate separately over DHS, though such an approach would require new votes in both the House and Senate.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/24/012426_Getty_GovExec_MinneapolisShooting/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 01:57:13.968069

But through public land orders, an administration can effectively close off these lands to otherwise lawful activities — most often mineral development — without meaningful accountability.
It is a vivid example of how executive power over public lands has grown far beyond what the Constitution ever intended.
Despite their name, public land orders are rules, given their sweeping impact on the public and the economy.
It would not only overturn Biden’s public land order, but it would also permanently bar any future administration from issuing a substantially similar order.","For decades, the executive branch has unilaterally withdrawn vast tracts of federal land from productive use through a mechanism known as a public land order. For instance, the Biden administration in 2023 signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdrew more than 225,000 acres of land in northern Minnesota from mineral development.

According to experts, this area contains “world-class deposits” and one of the largest undeveloped copper-nickel and platinum-group metal resources in the world — potentially including vast quantities of copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals.

By locking up these lands, the Biden administration effectively killed a planned development that could have helped meet growing global demand for minerals used in everything from household appliances to military aircraft. This decision was made despite opposition from members of Congress, mineral developers and local residents who recognized the economic opportunity that responsible development could bring to the region.

The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres of land — about 28 percent of the United States. These lands contain many of the natural resources essential to our modern economy. Traditionally, federal lands are presumed to be open to multiple uses, including responsible resource development.

But through public land orders, an administration can effectively close off these lands to otherwise lawful activities — most often mineral development — without meaningful accountability. With a single signature, the Department of the Interior can — as in the Minnesota case — lock away a mineral-rich area of land five times the size of Washington, D.C. There was no debate, no vote and no accountability.

That decision, which was buried in bureaucratic procedure, wiped out jobs, investment and access to critical minerals the nation desperately needs. It is a vivid example of how executive power over public lands has grown far beyond what the Constitution ever intended.

Congress, however, is not powerless in the face of such executive action. The Congressional Review Act provides lawmakers with a powerful tool to rein in agency overreach by allowing Congress to nullify federal rules. Despite their name, public land orders are rules, given their sweeping impact on the public and the economy.

Historically, the Congressional Review Act has been woefully underutilized, with less than 1 percent of finalized agency rules ever targeted for repeal. That is beginning to change. During the 119th Congress, lawmakers have already used it to rescind 22 rules, reducing regulatory burdens on Americans by more than $130 billion. Congress has eliminated regulatory burdens that were previously thought to be off-limits from the law’s reach, including the repeal of California’s EPA electric vehicle waiver and several Biden-era resource management plans.

Now it is time to apply the CRA to misguided, job-killing public land orders.

This month, Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) introduced a CRA resolution to nullify Biden’s pubilc land order in Minnesota. The House has passed that resolution, marking a decisive step toward lifting the Biden-era mining ban in northern Minnesota. In the previous Congress, the House passed a bill to revoke this order, but this resolution offers an even stronger solution. It would not only overturn Biden’s public land order, but it would also permanently bar any future administration from issuing a substantially similar order. And unlike most legislation, Congressional Review Act resolutions are not subject to a Senate filibuster.

Repealing the Biden-era land order would be a major victory for American consumers, domestic manufacturers and industries that rely on critical minerals. It would also reaffirm the Constitution’s separation of powers by restoring Congress’s role in major land-use decisions.

More broadly, passage of this CRA resolution should establish a critical precedent: that public land orders are rules subject to the CRA. That precedent would empower Congress to reexamine other harmful PLOs, including one that withdrew over 20,000 acres in South Dakota, known to have deposits of gold and other minerals.

Major policy decisions belong in Congress, not behind closed doors in the executive branch. The Congressional Review Act gives lawmakers a brief 60-day window to act. Now that the House has acted, the Senate must seize this opportunity and quickly approve the resolution and send it to the president’s desk. Passing the resolution offers a clear opportunity to restore economic opportunity, domestic production and the constitutional balance of power.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Saturday evening said that Democrats will block a major government funding package if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), calling the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis “appalling.”

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said in a statement.

“Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he warned.

Schumer blasted Senate and House Republicans for failing to include language in the Homeland Security spending bill to put constraints on ICE officers, who have been accused of using excessive force against protesters in Minneapolis.

He issued his remarks after law enforcement officials identified Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse and Minneapolis resident, as the man who was shot and killed by federal agents during an ICE operation Saturday morning.

“Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,” Schumer said.

Schumer’s statement came after liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is viewed as a potential primary challenger to Schumer in 2028, called on Senate Democrats to block ICE funding.

“Americans are being killed in the street by their government. Our Constitution is being shredded and our rights are dissolving. Resist. Senate Democrats should block ICE funding this week. Activate the National Guard. We can and must stop this,” she said.

She spoke out against ICE funding after Pretti’s fatal shooting by a Border Patrol Agent.

Senate Democrats are now scheduled to hold a caucus-wide conference call at 6 p.m. on Sunday to discuss their strategy for how to handle the government funding bills that need to pass by Jan. 30 to avoid a partial government shutdown.

Schumer’s new statement marks a significant shift in sentiment among senior Senate Democrats, who signaled last week that a six-bill appropriations package passed by the House would likely to pass the upper chamber by the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the most senior member of the Senate Democratic caucus, said in a statement last week that blocking funding for DHS would have little impact on ICE operations.

“ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a CR nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,” Murray said, referring to tens of billions of dollars allocated to ICE in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law last year.

Murray argued that the “suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.”

The House last week passed a rule to combine six different appropriations bills funding more than two-thirds of the federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Education and Health and Human Services, into one package that was set to be fast-tracked on the Senate floor.

Several of those spending measures passed the House with strong bipartisan support while the bill funding Homeland Security passed more narrowly by a margin of 220 to 207. Only seven House Democrats voted for that measure, which also fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Since, then a growing number of Senate Democrats have said they would vote against a government funding package that includes money for Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has become a target of Democratic outrage over images of violent confrontations between ICE officers and protesters.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is up for re-election in November, wrote Saturday on the social platform X.

“This brutal crackdown has to end,” he added. “I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) accused Noem of turning ICE “into an aggressive paramilitary force that terrorizes our communities, interferes with local policing and makes our communities less safe.”

“She has abused her authority — I will not support a funding bill that gives her a blank check to fund ICE’s inhumane tactics and excessive force,” he said in a Friday statement.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Friday called for Democrats to “insist” on adding language to the Homeland Security bill to require ICE officers to obtain arrest warrants before entering a target’s home and implement other reforms.

“I think there is an opportunity. Certainly, there’s an obligation to try to insist on conditions attached to these appropriations bills,” he said in an interview with MS NOW’s “Morning Joe.”

“I’m a ‘no’ vote on that spending bill unless there are conditions that require ICE to go to a judge to get a warrant as well as other constraints,” he said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/schumerchuck_010626gn12_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-25 01:57:18.479164

That legislation largely contained tax cuts and spending reductions for programs including Medicaid and food assistance, but also included $190 billion for the Department of Homeland Security.
But a number of Senate Democrats said on Saturday that those measures fell far short of what was necessary in the current moment.","Bipartisan legislation to fund a broad swath of the government and avert a shutdown at the end of the week appeared to be in grave danger on Saturday, as key Senate Democrats vowed to oppose it after federal agents shot and killed a Minneapolis resident.

The rapidly escalating opposition to the measure, which includes $64.4 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including $10 billion for ICE, amplified the likelihood of a partial government shutdown at the end of the month. The legislation requires the support of Democrats to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster and advance in the Senate.

“Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the D.H.S. funding bill is included,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in a statement, calling what is unfolding in Minnesota “appalling” and “unacceptable in any American city.”

Recognizing the depth of Democratic outrage, Senate Republicans immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government. The measure also funds the Pentagon and State Department, as well as health, education, labor and transportation programs.

“I’m exploring all options,” said Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, adding that she had been in touch with Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader. “We have five other bills that are really vital, and I’m relatively confident they would pass.”

A planned vote on the package next week had already promised to pose an agonizing dilemma for many Democrats. They have been eager to avoid another shutdown but have grown increasingly infuriated by the scenes of chaos and violence coming out of Minnesota and facing intense pressure not to fund ICE. Some had already announced they would not support the package as a result, but a substantial bloc had been expected to swallow their reservations and back it.

But hours after the killing on Saturday, a flood of Democrats who had previously been seen as likely to support the deal declared that they simply could not do so.

“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement announcing her opposition. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe. It’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote on social media: “I cannot and will not vote to fund D.H.S. while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

The spending measure that senators are set to take up includes six bills to fund the government that Democrats and Republicans negotiated, and that the House already passed.

The House considered the homeland security portion separately, given the depth of Democratic opposition, and all but seven House Democrats voted against it.

The measure rejects President Trump’s request for an $840 million increase in funding for ICE, instead leaving it roughly the same as the previous year, when the agency was operating off funds provided in a stopgap measure.

While other departments and agencies would most likely shutter if Senate Democrats filibuster the spending package, ICE could potentially tap the $75 billion Republicans allocated to it in their marquee domestic policy bill. That legislation largely contained tax cuts and spending reductions for programs including Medicaid and food assistance, but also included $190 billion for the Department of Homeland Security.

During negotiations on the homeland security bill, Republicans rejected a series of proposals by Democrats to rein in ICE, including barring funds from being used to to detain or deport U.S. citizens. Democrats succeeded in winning the addition of $20 million for purchasing body cameras for ICE agents.

They also won the inclusion of a provision to reduce funding for Ms. Noem’s office by $29.5 million and require the secretary to pay for any travel on government aircraft — in this case private jets the Coast Guard bought — out of the budget for her own office.

Ms. Collins, who called for an investigation into the shooting, noted that the spending measure also include some new guardrails on ICE, included money for de-escalation training and added authority for the agency’s inspector general to investigate disputed accounts of ICE activities. Those provisions would be lost if Congress ended up not approving the new bill, she said.

But a number of Senate Democrats said on Saturday that those measures fell far short of what was necessary in the current moment.

“I am voting against funding for D.H.S. until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a member of the Appropriations Committee. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory and making all of us less safe.”

Mr. Schumer also said he would vote no.

Photos from the scene show a masked agent standing next to Liam, who was wearing his backpack and a blue winter hat with bunny ears. He had just returned from preschool. The father and son were then quickly sent to a detention facility in Texas.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis and defended ICE for targeting the boy’s father and detaining the preschooler.

Vice President JD Vance: “So, the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old. Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death?”

Local officials in Columbia Heights condemned the detention of 5-year-old Liam Ramos. Rachel James serves on the Columbia Heights City Council. She described efforts by neighbors to protect the boy.

Rachel James: “I heard one neighbor say, 'I live in this house. I'm part of this family. I can take him. Let him come to me.’ I heard another neighbor on the other side say, 'I have the forms. His mom signed the forms. Let me have him. I know him. I know him. … I kept saying, “Stop. Wait. He can go with us. He can go with the teachers.”' And then they took him over to the car, and he was just standing there. And then they quickly put him in the back seat and drove away.”

On Thursday, the lawyer for the Ramos family, Marc Prokosch, said Liam and his father had come to the U.S. in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum.

Marc Prokosch: “Liam and his dad did enter the United States at a port of entry to seek asylum through the CBP One app at the Brownsville border crossing. So they did everything right when they came in. They used the app. They made an appointment. They came to the border and presented themselves to Customs and Border Patrol. They’ve shared all of their information with the government, and they were following the process. They were just trying to secure safety and persecution for their family from their home country. But ICE didn’t care about the fact that they had those pending claims, and then just arrested them.”

In news from Gaza, Israeli tank shelling killed four Palestinians on Thursday. The killings came as President Trump was launching his so-called Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland. At the ceremony, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner outlined his vision for turning Gaza into a glitzy seaside resort filled with futuristic high-rise buildings.

Jared Kushner: “In the Middle East, they build cities like this in — you know, 2-3 million people, they build this in three years. And so, stuff like this is very doable, if we make it happen.”

Kushner said the first phase of the project would be rebuilding the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which was leveled by Israel. The Rafah border crossing with Egypt is expected to reopen next week.

Many Palestinians fear Israel and the U.S. will move to forcibly displace them from Gaza. On Thursday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog met in Davos with the leader of Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region. Israel recently became the first nation to recognize Somaliland as an independent nation. There have been reports Israel wants to expel Palestinians en masse from Gaza to Somaliland.

This all comes as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive with little food or shelter. This is Mohammed Al-Qudra in Khan Younis speaking about Trump’s plan for Gaza.

Mohammed Al-Qudra: “No matter how much he says, it’s all in vain. Why? Because we, as citizens, aren’t seeing any real change on the ground. The suffering remains the same. Rain. There are no tents, no shelters, as you can see, the destruction. Wood, we don’t have that. … President Trump announced that the second phase had begun, but we haven’t seen anything. People in al-Mawasi are living in tents, displaced. People in the east can’t reach their homes. You can hear the shooting, the shelling, day and night, martyrs.”

The Wall Street Journal is reporting the Trump administration has been plotting ways to topple the Cuban government in the wake of the U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Cloud ICE clash.","ST. CLOUD. Minn. — At least 350 people gathered for about two hours from roughly 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, outside the Great River Regional Library in St. Cloud to protest against reportedly violent tactics being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Protesters gathered as a man was reportedly fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Saturday, according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. DHS authorities say the man who was shot was armed.

On Jan. 7, Renee Good, 37, was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. One week later, on Jan. 14 another man was shot in the leg by a federal agent, after three men reportedly used a broom handle and shovels on the agent.

Americans for Democracy, a St. Cloud-area grassroots group, helped organize Saturday's protest, according to founder Jill Kelly, who referenced the morning's shooting in an interview with the St. Cloud Times.

""People are enraged over what happened, (both with) this morning and what's been happening,"" Kelly said. ""It is unbelievable that it's happening in our state, and they're attacking us more so than any other state.""

While St. Cloud is a little more than an hour-drive north of the Twin Cities, where on Jan. 22, Vice President JD Vance said immigration enforcement is focused, Kelly said, immigration efforts impact the entire state. On Jan. 12 there was a clash between ICE agents and civilians that reportedly percipitated agents to use a chemical irritant on civilians. The crowd threw snowballs at agents during the St. Cloud confrontation.

""I think we've been seeing that (ICE presence) throughout the whole state,"" Kelly said. ""Pop-up protests are happening. People aren't gonna put up with this.""

Immigration enforcement also trickles down into local politics. Two St. Cloud City Council members introduced resolutions after the Jan. 12 St. Cloud ICE clash. Councilmember Hudda Ibrahim introduced a resolution to reaffirm the city's objective to be a welcoming place for all. Meanwhile, Councilmember Scott Brodeen proposed a resolution to support all law enforcement officers, including ICE, and the rule of law.

Those resolutions are slated for discussion at the council's Jan. 26 meeting.

Coleen Fitzgerald, dressed as a clown, drove to the St. Cloud protest from Milaca. She said her outfit resembles federal officials who she believes act foolishly. She held pictures of President Donald Trump, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Vance. The pictures were decorated by Fitzgerald to make the officials look like clowns.

""They were clowns before they got put in those offices, and they'll be clowns when they leave,"" Fitzgerald said. ""They're not people that are respected.""

While both Kelly and Fitzgerald oppose violent tactics used by ICE, they said, they support the deportation of criminals. However, both said, the tactics and methods of those deportations needs to be civil and humane.

""There's got to be some immigration enforcement, but it doesn't have to be done with the vitriol and the violence that they're doing now,"" Fitzgerald said.

Kelly had a similar sentiment, saying she wants to make sure due process is provided.

""I think most of us would agree that illegal immigrants that have committed serious crimes should not be in this country,"" she said. ""But there is a way to go about things. First of all, due process. That is our right.""

The legislation needs 60 votes to secure passage in the chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats. And a number of key Democrats who have voted for recent appropriations measures said they’ll vote against funding the Department of Homeland Security unless restrictions are put on how immigration officers carry out enforcement operations.

Follow live updates out of Minneapolis here.

The package, which has passed the House, is slated to come up for a Senate vote this week.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Saturday. “Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who broke with her party and opposed its recent shutdown standoff over the Affordable Care Act, said she won’t support the DHS measure.

“The Trump Administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability. They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants. I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who, like Rosen, was one of the eight Senate Democrats who voted to reopen the government in November, also came out against the DHS legislation.

“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen said in a statement. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., another one of the eight Democrats who voted for the November bill, came out against the current package one day before the Minnesota shooting. He said Congress shouldn’t validate a president who is “acting chaotically and unlawfully” and that he wants “significant amendment” to it.

Numerous Republican senators defended DHS after the killing of the man, identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse serving veterans.

But the department’s actions also sparked heavy criticism from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, who negotiated funding package.

“This looks like an execution. There must be an investigation. There must be accountability,” Murray said on X. “Joining ICE does not give you license to murder. The President is escalating the situation—and I have no faith he will stop. The Republican Congress must join us to end this. Enough.”

The legislation funds ICE at current levels, but without the guardrails and restraints that Democrats had demanded on how immigration officers may carry out enforcement.

“I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a statement. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe.”

The non-DHS funding measures are less controversial and include various provisions that Democrats count as victories, including money for child care, mental health, housing assistance and Pell Grants. Some Democrats, including Cortez Masto, are calling for DHS money to be decoupled and voted on separately.

But there’s no indication that GOP leaders will do that. A spokesperson for Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said they will come up as one bill.

Another complication for Democrats is that Republicans passed a one-time infusion of $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including ICE, which would be legally available for the Trump administration to spend even if DHS funding lapses.

Republicans will need at least seven Democrats — probably eight, if Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., continues his streak of voting against appropriations bills — to pass any measure.

Additional Democrats who said they’ll oppose the DHS funding bill include Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Mark Warner of Virginia.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., re-emphasized his opposition to funding DHS without restraints on officers.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-11/241105-dhs-seal-wc-1420-227213.jpg",N,,2026-01-24 20:57:35.677420

Instead, Republicans believe it’s up to Democrats to decide whether or not to vote against the funding package and avoid a partial shutdown.","Congress has already passed full-year funding for some agencies — including the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Interior and Justice — but not for several of the largest, including the Pentagon. Temporary funding for those departments, representing more than 75 percent of federal discretionary spending, expires midnight Friday.

Senate Democrats will hold a conference call Sunday evening, according to a Democratic aide granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. The call will give them a chance to discuss next steps with the Senate stuck out of town until at least Tuesday because of the massive winter storm affecting much of the country.

Earlier in the day, as news of the Minneapolis shooting spread, several Democratic senators who had previously voted to advance government funding measures under President Donald Trump vowed to oppose DHS funding this time. Funding for ICE and Border Patrol, the agencies involved in the Minnesota operation, is included in the pending Senate bill.

“I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) in a statement Saturday. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe.”

Schatz helped advance a funding bill in March, and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who voted to end the 43-day shutdown in November, also both said Saturday that they will oppose the DHS funding bill.

“I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen said on X. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

The DHS bill passed the House Thursday 220-207, with only seven Democrats voting for it. But Republican House leaders merged it with five other bills funding the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and State, among others, sending it to the Senate as one package.

More than half of the 47-member Democratic caucus has already vowed to oppose the package, many before Saturday’s shooting. And that number is growing as Democrats’ re-evaluate the legislation in the wake of the shooting and as they face pressure from House Democrats and their Senate colleagues, not to mention outside voices close to the party base.

Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate seeking a Senate seat in Michigan, said in an interview Saturday he saw no way for any Democrat to justify a vote for DHS funding.

“How many more people do they need to shoot?” he asked.

A group of senators, including Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), have been whipping colleagues for days to oppose the DHS bill, according to two aides granted anonymity to discuss their private effort. And two people familiar with the plans said House Democrats are scheduled to hold a private caucus call Sunday morning to discuss a response to the shooting.

Cortez Masto, in a statement, suggested dropping the Department of Homeland Security bill from the larger package, noting there is a “bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget.”

“Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe,” she said.

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said he would agree to “immediately pass” the other five bills while providing “short term funding for DHS so the Senate can fully debate and vote on common sense reforms to ICE that bolster the rule of law.”

But stripping out the DHS bill before the Friday deadline would require every senator to agree — something Republicans aren’t likely to be able to get. Any changes to the package, meanwhile, will require sending it back to the House, which has already left town until after the shutdown deadline.

Instead, Republicans believe it’s up to Democrats to decide whether or not to vote against the funding package and avoid a partial shutdown. GOP leaders aren’t currently expected to bring the House back early from its break, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy.

Democratic aides, meanwhile, privately acknowledged Saturday that the odds of a shutdown were rising, though some questioned what alternatives are available if Democrats block the pending six-bill package.

Heading into the weekend, some Democrats acknowledged they were conflicted — including Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a senior appropriator who has championed Congress’ ability to use the spending bills to reverse many of Trump’s foreign aid cuts.

“I don’t know the details of exactly what the language is in the Homeland Security bills in terms of trying to hold ICE accountable and trying to minimize their misconduct, and I don’t know whether it is worse to have a continuing resolution and how that might be misused,” Coons told reporters Friday.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F47%2F26%2F1beb046d49468116fc0a3e55f93f%2Fu-s-congress-30162.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 20:57:41.714199

US President Donald Trump on Saturday urged Minnesota officials to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate freely, warning that the state would face more severe consequences if it is not cleared of undocumented immigrants.

“Let our ICE patriots do their job! 12,000 illegal alien criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. He warned that those still in the state would create “something far worse than you are witnessing today.”

Trump’s comments came hours after a US Border Patrol officer shot and killed an armed individual wanted for “violent assault” during a targeted operation in Minneapolis.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara identified the man as a 37-year-old white American citizen with only traffic violations on record. Authorities said he was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.

Trump said federal agents were deployed to Minnesota because of what he described as “massive monetary fraud, with billions of dollars missing” under Democratic border policies.

He questioned why local police failed to protect federal officers and accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of “inciting insurrection” through their public statements. Trump described the unfolding events as a “cover-up” for what he alleged were stolen public funds.

Vance, Bondi blame Minnesota officials

US Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi also placed blame on Minnesota’s leadership for the fatal shooting, saying state and city officials refused to cooperate with federal authorities.

“When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand,” Vance said. He added that Minneapolis leadership “has so far refused to answer those requests.”

Bondi told Fox News that the Justice Department sent Gov. Walz “a very strong letter” demanding that he “better support President Trump.”

She claimed the shooting occurred because Minneapolis officials had declared the city a sanctuary jurisdiction, alleging that undocumented immigrants were drawn there for protection.

Tensions have escalated in Minnesota amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, following allegations of large-scale fraud linked to publicly subsidized day care centers. State and local officials have denied the claims.

The situation further deteriorated after the ICE-related operation resulted in the fatal shooting of an American citizen.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) wrote on the social platform X. “This brutal crackdown has to end. I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

On Saturday morning, a Minneapolis resident was shot and killed during an alleged “armed struggle” with Border Patrol agents, just a block from where 37-year-old Renee Good was fatally shot in her SUV by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer Jonathan Ross. In another incident, a Venezuelan migrant was shot in the leg after federal officials claimed he struck an officer with a “shovel or broom stick.”

Days prior, seven House Democrats joined with nearly all Republicans to pass a sweeping $64.4 billion funding bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for ICE. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was the lone GOP congressman to vote against the measure.

It passed over the objections of Democratic leaders, who argued it did not do enough to rein in ICE operations and the conduct of officers.

The measure did contain a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, in an attempt to placate Democrats.

But following Saturday’s shooting in Minneapolis, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stated bluntly she was a “hell no” on the bill.

“I’m a hell no — not a penny more for ICE. We should not fund this terror,” she wrote on X.

The senators’ comments came after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) urged her Democratic colleagues on Saturday to oppose the bill when it comes to the floor for a vote next week.

“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X.

“DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence. They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO,” she continued.

Anger has already been growing over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics in the wake of several shootings involving federal agents in Minnesota this month, which have sparked widespread protests.

Saturday’s incident comes as senators are set to decide next week whether to send a package of funding bills, including the DHS bill, to President Trump’s desk as they race to avert a partial government shutdown.

That effort now seems more fraught amid an impending winter storm that has canceled votes for Monday and signs of opposition from Democrats.

Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) also said Saturday she would not support the measure, arguing it was time to “fight back.”

“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen wrote. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) joined the fray, writing on X that he will vote against funding DHS “until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable.”

“These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe,” he concluded.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, described the man who was shot Saturday as a “gunman” and suggested a cover-up by Minnesota Democrats.
OF MINNESOTA!” Trump wrote in a separate post.
“If you obstruct a law enforcement officer or assault a law enforcement officer, you are in violation of the law and will be arrested,” he added.
During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face.","“A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wrote on X Saturday, referring to a tweet from the Democratic National Committee about the shooting that stated “Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW.”

Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota focused her anger on ICE, posting on social media: “This appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement. I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community.”

In Saturday morning’s shooting, a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis who claimed he approached federal officers with a 9 mm gun but didn’t specify if he was holding or brandishing the weapon. Various videos of the incident appear to show the man holding a phone.

Minneapolis has emerged as the epicenter of the debate over the Trump administration’s immigration actions and deployment of federal agents. It came to a head after a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, earlier this month in an incident that has sparked weeks of demonstrations in the city and fights between the White House and state officials over who would investigate the shootings.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, described the man who was shot Saturday as a “gunman” and suggested a cover-up by Minnesota Democrats. The Justice Department has subpoenaed several Democratic Minneapolis state officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, who called the DOJ’s subpoena a “partisan distraction.”

“AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IS A ‘COVER UP’ FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE ONCE GREAT STATE (BUT SOON TO BE GREAT AGAIN!) OF MINNESOTA!” Trump wrote in a separate post.

Trump also assailed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, and Walz in the first Saturday post, accusing them of “inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino told reporters at a Saturday press conference that the incident “looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” though he didn’t provide any evidence for his claim.

“If you obstruct a law enforcement officer or assault a law enforcement officer, you are in violation of the law and will be arrested,” he added. “Our law enforcement officers take an oath to protect the public.”

Video of the shooting, posted on social media and verified by The New York Times, shows the 37-year-old man appearing to film agents in Minneapolis on Saturday before they push him and several others back. The videos don’t appear to show the man drawing his weapon, but not all angles are accounted for. During a struggle with the man on the ground, an agent fires several shots, then the group of federal agents back away.

The man, identified by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as Alex Pretti, had a legal permit to carry a firearm, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who spoke during a press conference Saturday.

Bovino told reporters that “an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a border patrol agent fired defensive shots.” But when asked by a reporter when the individual drew his firearm, Bovino said the shooting is still under investigation.

The latest POLITICO Poll illustrates just how sharply views of ICE — and its presence in cities across the country — diverge along partisan lines. A majority of voters who backed Trump in 2024 — 57 percent — say risks to the lives of anti-ICE protestors are a price worth paying to carry out immigration enforcement, compared with just 15 percent of voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris.

By contrast, nearly three-quarters of Harris voters — 71 percent — say it is not worth risking the lives of anti-ICE protesters to conduct immigration enforcement, a view shared by just 31 percent of Trump voters, the poll, conducted from Jan. 16 to 19, found.

The divide extends to perceptions of public safety: 64 percent of Trump voters say ICE agents make U.S. cities safer, while 80 percent of Harris voters say the opposite, that their presence is making them more dangerous.

Democrats also used heated language to describe the shooting. During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning. It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

His opponent, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, also weighed in: “This is the fifth-highest funded military force in the entire world. And what are they doing? They’re killing people in the middle of the street.”

Walz on Saturday urged the federal government to allow Minnesota officials to take control of the probe into the shooting. He told reporters that he said to the White House in an early morning call that “the federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period.”

“As I said last week, this federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Walz said at a press conference Saturday. “It’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed another life. I’ve seen the videos from several angles. And it’s sickening.”

When asked for comment, the White House referred POLITICO to Trump’s Truth Social post and to a post on X from the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed, “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted.”

They did not respond to requests to questions as to what evidence showed the man who was shot was a “terrorist.”

Vice President JD Vance also placed the blame of Saturday’s shooting at Minnesota leaders’ feet, saying their unwillingness to work with immigration enforcement agents was the primary reason for the shooting.

“When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand,” he wrote on X. “The local leadership in Minnesota has so far refused to answer those requests.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F33%2F66%2Ff3dd85dc4fdbb7faa2732e801c89%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-53307.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 18:58:14.223975

The National Weather Service’s Winter Storm Severity Index on Saturday afternoon displayed expected “extreme impacts” in northern Mississippi and “major impacts” in Washington, D.C., and surrounding states.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser implemented a state of emergency for the district on Friday, which went into effect on Saturday at noon. Several state governors also issued emergency declarations at the end of the week in preparation for the winter storm.

In her emergency order, Bowser noted an expected snowfall rate of 2-3 inches per hour and low temperatures “expected to have serious widespread effects.”

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced Friday afternoon that federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area will be closed on Monday, with “maximum telework” in effect.

“We hope that everyone stays safe (and warm) over the weekend,” OPM Director Scott Kupor wrote on X.

Up on Capitol Hill, the Senate postponed its first votes until Tuesday due to the storm, narrowing the already-tight deadline to negotiate and pass a minibus funding bill to avert a government shutdown.

The House approved the Republican-backed funding package on Thursday with the support of seven House Democrats.

The funding measure consists of six separate spending bills and needs the support of at least eight Democrats in order to pass in the Senate. Legislators have until Friday to pass the legislation or face the government shutting down.

Snow delays on Capitol Hill are rare but not unprecedented. The “Snowmageddon” blizzard in February of 2010 dumped feet of snow on D.C. and the surrounding states, grinding congressional activity to a halt for multiple days because lawmakers could not physically get to the U.S. Capitol.

Outside of D.C., the White House has also begun preparations for responses from federal agencies to the winter storm’s impact across several states.

President Trump approved emergency declarations for an additional 10 states to receive assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Saturday. The included states are Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana and West Virginia.

The Trump administration had previously approved South Carolina and Virginia’s requests.

“We are working closely with FEMA, Governors, and State Emergency Management teams to ensure the safety of everybody,” Trump, who is expected to remain in the District, posted on Truth Social on Saturday. “Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!”

FEMA said in a Saturday morning report that its National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) has currently categorized conditions at a “Level 3,” the lowest-level disaster response, which requires “a moderate amount of direct federal assistance.”

Additionally, the agency said in the report that the departments of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Transportation are preparing to assist with the federal response.

The unjust death of the 37-year-old man is yet another example of an extremely disturbing violent pattern associated with the Trump administration’s lawless and aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

This killing comes a little over two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, whose family has yet to be delivered justice, answers or accountability. Sadly, these two deadly incidents are not isolated. Back in December, Keith Porter, a 43-year-old father, was also killed by an off-duty ICE agent in Los Angeles, California.

In response to this horrific incident, Voto Latino issued the following statement:

“What happened in Minneapolis today is unacceptable. Another life has been lost during a reckless federal immigration operation. Two people, both 37 years old, have been killed within weeks of each other in the same city. We are witnessing an unprecedented pattern of excessive and deadly force being used against our own communities.

Instead of tamping down the chaos and state of uncertainty, the Trump administration continues to double down on its excessive and deadly use of force, distortion of facts, and the weaponization of the justice system. When federal agents are deployed into residential neighborhoods with little oversight and sweeping authority, people are put in harm’s way.

The people of Minneapolis have the right to demand ICE out of their neighborhoods, and accountability from the leaders who’ve led us to these conditions. We demand that there be an immediate and independent investigation into what happened today. The Trump administration has failed to protect another human life, and we urge Congress to impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem immediately.”

Judges decline to order lower court to approve charges

Defendants allege retaliation amid Trump's immigration crackdown

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.

The ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.

A federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants for five proposed defendants, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.

DEFENDANTS ACCUSE ADMINISTRATION OF RETALIATION

The case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed to protect Christian services.

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.

The Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing a risk of similar church disruptions.

The chief U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request as ""unheard of in our district"" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.

All three judges on the 8th Circuit panel agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.

The Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.

Rights watchdog warns International Protection Bill ‘still riddled with gaps’

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has delivered a sharp critique of the International Protection Bill 2026, published earlier this month. In a submission released last night, the Commission says the draft law ""lacks clarity on access to legal advice, vulnerability assessments and safeguards for victims of trafficking.""

IHREC welcomes the Government’s aim of cutting average asylum decision times to six months but argues that speed cannot trump fairness: mandatory interviews conducted in ‘integrated reception centres’ will, it fears, pressure applicants who have not yet secured legal representation. The body also questions proposed restrictions on applicants’ freedom of movement, warning that any de-facto detention must meet strict proportionality tests under EU law.

For applicants and employers trying to keep pace with these evolving rules, VisaHQ offers real-time guidance on Irish visa categories, document requirements and processing times; its specialists monitor legislative changes like the International Protection Bill and can assist with related travel or residency filings. More information is available at https://www.visahq.com/ireland/.

For employers, the Bill’s promise of faster decisions could ease uncertainty when recruiting asylum-seekers who later become eligible for work permits. Yet NGOs caution that rushed procedures risk higher appeal rates, prolonging cases and clogging courts.

Justice officials insist the text transposes the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum and that “all applicants will continue to receive free legal aid.” The Bill is expected to reach second stage in the Dáil next month; mobility teams should monitor amendments closely, as final provisions will determine time-lines for labour-market access and potential reporting obligations for sponsors of protection applicants.

As the world marks the Day of the Endangered Lawyer today, the coalition behind the observance has designated the United States as the focus country for 2026.

Every year, the International Coalition for the Day of the Endangered Lawyer, made up of legal associations, bar associations, and networks of legal defenders, selects a country to concentrate attention on the specific challenges lawyers there face and build awareness of the serious risks they’re confronting simply for doing their job.

In its annual report, released Thursday, the Coalition said this year’s selection is “grounded in serious concern over the documented and escalating pattern of interference with the independence of lawyers, law firms, bar associations, prosecutors, and judges in the United States.”

These developments raise profound questions regarding compliance with international legal standards governing the role and protection of lawyers, as well as the functioning of the justice system, it noted.

The United States now joins the ranks of dictatorships and autocracies like Belarus, China, Iran and Afghanistan, which have been countries of focus in the past.

“Let that sink in,” Nancy Hollander, an internationally recognized US criminal defence lawyer, said in November at the International Bar Association conference in Toronto. She was part of a panel discussing the assault on independent lawyering around the world.

“We’re in a terrible situation. We have an authoritarian fascist dictatorship. There’s no getting around it. No one can say that’s not where we are.”

‘A climate of fear’

Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, it has targeted lawyers and firms it perceives to be opposed to its agenda based on their current or past legal representation, or pro bono work.

This has involved executive orders naming firms and exerting pressure on them through “compliance arrangements,” raising concerns about coerced alignment and the erosion of professional independence.

There have also been threats to revoke security clearances and cancel federal contracts, as well as questioning and harassment of lawyers at border crossings and attacks on bar associations. Further, there’s been a chilling effect on legal representation in sensitive areas such as immigration, civil liberties and LGBTI+ rights.

Judicial independence is under attack amid a barrage of politicized criticism of judges, including threats of removal, calls for impeachment, and efforts to delegitimize unfavourable rulings. On top of the creeping executive interference, politicized criticism has led to increased threats of physical violence against judges and their families.

“Taken together, these measures do not constitute isolated incidents. They form a pattern that creates a climate of fear, uncertainty, and anticipatory self-censorship within the legal profession, discouraging lawyers from taking on cases, clients, or arguments that may attract political or administrative retaliation,” the Coalition said in its report.

Members were alarmed by the “sustained and co-ordinated campaign aimed at undermining the independence of the legal profession and the judiciary.”

The Coalition noted that this year’s focus on the United States does not suggest that attacks on lawyers are new or unique there. However, there is a “troubling pattern of political intimidation and institutional destabilization unprecedented in the modern history of the US.” The Coalition said this escalation in pressure demands collective international attention.

It also underscores the fact that no matter how entrenched the rule of law may be, no jurisdiction is immune to backsliding.

The work of Margaret Satterthwaite, the UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, influenced the Coalition’s decision to focus on the United States. An independent monitor of how legal professionals are treated around the world, she’s raised concerns about what’s been happening south of the border.

“What happened after the second Trump presidency began was that I started to see some emblematic signs of what I would call autocratization,” she told the CBA’s Verdicts & Voices podcast in November.

Hollander, who has represented Chelsea Manning and several Guantanamo Bay detainees, said the Trump administration has turned the Department of Justice into the Department of Retaliation.

That’s seen scores of government lawyers fired for being a part of prosecutions against Trump over the January 6 attack on the Capitol and other alleged crimes.

“They’re taking the brunt of this,” she said.

“It’s (now) his personal law firm.”

Among those targeted in what’s been described as a “campaign of retribution” are Jack Smith, former special counsel and New York attorney general Letitia James.

“This is only the beginning,” Hollander said, noting many lawyers can no longer even get into public buildings and courtrooms.

“I’ve represented a lot of people who’ve had their clearance taken away.”

What’s unfolding has seen lawyers mobilize south of the border. Hollander pointed to the newly formed Lawyers for the Rule of Law.

“We are a national network of volunteer attorneys committed to defending democracy and the rule of law—especially when those in power fail to do so,” the group says on its website.

In addition to pro bono representation, members are providing amicus advocacy, holding leaders and public officials accountable for unethical and illegal activities, providing public education, and organizing peaceful protests.

Beyond borders

Often, it’s not the government in the country where they practice that a lawyer has to worry about.

Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, an Irish barrister specializing in human rights and civil liberties, told the IBA panel that authoritarian regimes seek to silence critics wherever they are in the world through transnational repression.

Increasingly, the law is used as a systematic tool to shut down the rule of law and freedom of expression through direct, online and remote threats, the cancellation of passports, co-opting other countries to join them, coercion, and physical surveillance.

She’s been followed around the United Nations, and as a result of her representing jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media mogul Jimmy Lai, she’s been targeted by China. This has included surveillance, threats on her life, and threats of rape. The latter extended to her children.

Gallagher said that more lawyers are being killed than journalists in the Philippines for the work they’re doing. And as soon as a lawyer takes on a case against Iran or Saudi Arabia, they’re targeted.

“It’s an anywhere in the world problem,” she said of the length of a state’s arm.

“Nowhere is safe if you’re a lawyer.”

Here in Canada, Irwin Cotler knows this all too well.

The former MP and justice minister has long been an outspoken critic of the regime in Tehran, and started campaigning in 2008 to have the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps listed as a terrorist entity (which didn’t happen until 2024). His work as a human rights advocate and lawyer, representing Iranian dissidents, put him in Iran’s crosshairs.

“I remember the date exactly, November 14, 2023, because I was flying back from Washington. We landed at Trudeau airport in Montreal, and we received notice from the RCMP as soon as we landed: ‘Don't leave, wait for us at the baggage counter.’”

Officers met him, took him to a room and told him they had evidence of an “imminent and lethal threat” on his life.

From then on, he had 24/7 protection — four armoured cars outside his house at all times and armed RCMP officers with him everywhere he went.

Cotler says the threat wasn’t surprising. He’d had issues with Iran for 20 years at that point, and knew from friends there that the regime characterized him as an enemy of the people.

In October 2024, he was informed of a plot to assassinate him within 48 hours. He was supposed to attend the 60th anniversary of his McGill law class that evening, and in the morning, the RCMP told him all seemed okay. Later in the day, they told him he couldn’t go.

“I said I'd really been looking forward to this. And they said, ‘No, we have new information about an imminent threat of assassination on your life within the next 24 to 48 hours. So you can't go.’ And I didn't go.”

In recent months, Cotler’s level of protection has been reduced, as the threat was perceived to not be as great as it had been.

“I laughed,” he said.

“I told them I’m happy to have it lowered because it was a little cumbersome to have so many people around when there are other people who need protection. But I follow Iran very closely, and it’s the other way around. Iran has been intensifying its transnational repression and assassinations. CSIS came out with a report recently that said exactly that.”

While no longer under 24-hour protection, he still has security accompanying him everywhere he goes.

So what have the last few years been like, knowing he’s at risk?

“You just factor it in to your lifestyle. You know that if you want to go somewhere, you have to notify the RCMP and give them two hours' notice so they can come pick you up and take you where you need to go. And after a while, you just know that that’s the reality you live with it.”

Cotler said his situation should be seen as a wake-up call. Iran has sleeper cells in Canada, along with a critical mass of repression and targets, including journalists, lawyers, dissidents, and leaders of the diaspora. While Russia and China also engage in transnational repression, he says Iran takes it a step further with assassination.

“The phenomenon of transnational repression and assassination means that we have to take the necessary measures here,” he said.

“This is a standing threat to our national security, and we have to take it seriously.”

A wide and well-documented trend

Cotler is the international chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, one of 13 organizations worldwide that are expressing deep alarm at the growing repression of lawyers for the legitimate exercise of their professional duties.

“Attacks on lawyers strike at the very heart of the rule of law, deny victims meaningful access to justice, and enable wider assaults on human rights and democratic institutions,” the groups said in a statement marking the International Day of the Endangered Lawyer.

From state capture of bar associations, systemic government oppression, politically motivated prosecutions and imprisonment for defending state opponents, reputational smears through propaganda, and forced disappearances, authoritarian regimes are deliberately targeting lawyers. The groups are calling out Russia, China, Iran, Afghanistan, Tanzania, and Turkey, among others, for what’s become a wide and well-documented trend.

“Lawyers are disbarred, disciplined, arbitrarily detained, prosecuted, forced into exile, subjected to surveillance and harassment, and in some cases killed, precisely because they seek to uphold the rights of their clients, including human rights defenders, opposition leaders, journalists, women, minorities, and other marginalized communities,” the statement said.

“Despite this, lawyers continue to perform a crucial function. Even in countries without an independent and impartial judiciary, where judicial outcomes are largely predetermined, lawyers document abuses, create records of testimonies and verdicts, and preserve evidence that can one day support accountability.”

While justice is never won easily, it cannot be won at all if those who defend it are left defenceless, the group says, which is why it is calling on states to end all forms of persecution, retaliation and harassment against lawyers for their professional activities, and immediately release all lawyers detained or imprisoned for representing clients or peacefully exercising their own rights.

In May 2025, after a decade of work, the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe introduced the first international treaty aimed at safeguarding lawyers from threats, harassment, and undue interference in their work.

The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of the Profession of Lawyer currently has 25 signatories.

“It’s the first internationally binding instrument to defend the legal profession,” Thierry Wickers, past president of the CCBE, told the IBA panel in November.

“It’s a recognition of the place and role we play in a democratic society.”

He noted that any country in the world can sign it, and that there is monitoring to ensure it’s correctly applied in countries that have added their names.

Of course, the convention is only effective if governments give it force. That’s why the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and other organizations are calling on countries to sign, ratify, and fully implement it.

“We encourage states in other regions to develop complementary binding standards so that protection of the legal profession becomes a universal norm.”

After all, as the Coalition makes clear in its report, the independence of the legal profession is not a professional privilege.

“It is a cornerstone of the rule of law and a prerequisite for access to justice, fair trial guarantees, and the effective protection of human rights. International law is unequivocal on this point.”",https://nationalmagazine.ca/MediaGallery/NM/NationalMagazine/Banners/Big%20Box/desktop_cotler.png?ext=.png,N,,2026-01-24 19:58:41.012577

A 5-year-old boy and his father who were detained by immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota are now being held at the South Texas Family Detention Center in Dilley, roughly 70 miles southwest of San Antonio, according to attorneys and members of Congress.

The transfer has drawn growing national attention, with lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates calling for the child’s release while federal officials defend the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

San Antonio Congressman Joaquin Castro said his office has been pressing federal authorities for information and urging ICE to release the boy.

“My staff and I have been working to make sure that this young boy is safe and to demand his release by ICE,” Castro said in a video posted to social media. He also criticized what he described as a lack of transparency from immigration officials.

Concerns about transparency intensified this week after U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he was denied entry to the Dilley facility while attempting to conduct congressional oversight. Murphy said federal authorities blocked his visit despite providing advance notice.

“Members of Congress have a constitutional right to inspect these facilities, and a clear statutory right as well,” Murphy said in a statement. “The fact they denied me access even with 24 hours’ notice should make everybody deeply fearful of what is happening inside this facility and facilities like it.”

School officials and community leaders in Minnesota have also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding the boy’s detention, saying the incident caused distress among children and families in the community.

The Department of Homeland Security rejected claims that the child was targeted or used as part of an enforcement tactic. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents were attempting to arrest the boy’s father, not the child.

“ICE did not target a child,” McLaughlin said in a statement posted on X. She said agents approached the father, who then ran, leaving his son behind. According to McLaughlin, one officer remained with the five-year-old “to ensure his safety” while other agents apprehended the father.

McLaughlin also disputed claims that the child was used to lure anyone from the home, calling those accounts “categorically false.” She said ICE officers are instructed to prioritize child safety during enforcement actions and that parents are typically given options during custody decisions.

“Parents are given the choice to remain with their children or designate a safe caregiver,” McLaughlin said, adding that keeping families together in detention is intended to avoid separation during immigration proceedings.

DHS officials have said the boy’s mother was not detained during the enforcement action. Advocates, however, say separating a child from one parent and transferring the family hundreds of miles away still raises serious concerns about trauma, access to legal counsel, and the well-being of young children.

Demonstrators demanded the withdrawal of 3,000 federal officers sent by the Trump administration.

Separate protests at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport and a federal building led to over 100 arrests.

Tens of thousands of Minnesotans marched in downtown Minneapolis Friday, Jan. 23, in a negative 30 degree windchill to protest the federal government’s continuing surge of immigration enforcement — demanding civil rights and a withdrawal of the 3,000 officers sent here by the administration of President Donald Trump.

The demonstration took place on “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom,” a general strike supported by Minnesota unions, progressive faith leaders and community activists. Proponents encouraged all Minnesotans to stay home from work, school and refrain from shopping — disruptions of normal orders of business to protest the presence of federal immigration agents in Minnesota.

The massive protest began at The Commons Park at 2 p.m. in Minneapolis. The march ended with a rally at Target Center.

Natasha Dockter, the first vice president of the Minneapolis Federation of Educators’ teachers chapter, handed out hand warmers to demonstrators at The Commons alongside other teachers.

“I’m out here today because what’s going on in our city is completely and totally unacceptable. It’s impacting the lives of our students and their families that we serve,” Dockter said.

Sergey Goro and Ben Daniel were visiting the Twin Cities from San Francisco and Seattle for the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships, which was delayed due to the extreme cold.

Goro said that he’d been to No Kings protests — demonstrations against the Trump administration’s authoritarian policies — in San Francisco, but that they weren’t as large as the Minneapolis protest.

Daniel agreed: “We can really feel that everyone’s on board here — that this is ridiculous and it’s gotta stop.”

Daniela Morales, 16, carrying a Mexican flag, said her parents are both Mexican immigrants and that she attended the protest on behalf of people who can’t speak out.

“I’m really glad to see everybody come out and support each other and our neighbors and fight against the administration,” Morales said.

Other ICE protests in Minneapolis led to arrests

A morning protest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport led to the arrests of roughly 100 clergy by MSP and Bloomington law enforcement Friday, according to a statement from protest organizers.

Demonstrators at the airport were standing or kneeling on the roadway outside Terminal 1’s departures area and led away by law enforcement.

Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said in an email that the airport “worked in advance with event organizers to best accommodate their right to freedom of expression while also ensuring uninterrupted operations.”

“When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1,” Lea wrote. Lea confirmed there were around 100 arrests.

At least one demonstrator was also arrested at the nearby Whipple Federal Building, where federal agents deployed chemical irritants into a crowd of protestors, the Star Tribune reported. Around noon, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had given three dispersal orders for protestors to unblock an access road at the building. The Whipple Building, now a base for federal immigration operations, has been an ongoing site of protests.

Over 700 businesses closed Friday to support the “ICE Out” day, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the demonstration’s website states.

Over a dozen churches across Minnesota announced prayer vigils to “mourn, pray and plant seeds of hope with one another,” according to ISAIAH, the nonprofit coalition of Minnesota faith and community groups.

Dozens of school districts across the state closed Friday because of the dangerously cold temperatures. Minneapolis Public Schools were already planned to be closed Friday for a teacher record-keeping day.","https://www.sctimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/24/PSTC/88328580007-mega-ice.jpg?crop=2047,1153,x0,y191&width=2047&height=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-24 15:58:48.899659

""She has asked for answers about the legal bases for these actions and about how ICE is prioritizing its activities to target what it calls ‘the worst of the worst.’”

DHS agents have arrested more than 100 people on a target list of 1,400 immigrants since the ICE surge began on Tuesday, the agency said, focusing on metropolitan Portland and Lewiston, the state’s largest and most diverse cities.

Neither DHS nor ICE have explained why individuals are on the Maine immigrant target list, including whether they have outstanding deportation orders or pending criminal charges, if they are suspected of entering the country illegally, have pending asylum applications, have applied for or received work permits, or other reasons.

DHS has described its ""Operation: Catch of the Day"" as “an immigration enforcement effort across the state of Maine targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.”

Collins has asked for “an explanation of ICE’s reported policy change allowing agents to enter residences with only an administrative warrant, though we have not yet seen reports of this occurring in Maine,” according to Kernen.

Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told reporters on Thursday that an internal ICE memo that purportedly justifies warrantless home searches is “blatantly unconstitutional.”

Gov. Janet Mills, a former county district attorney and state attorney general, told reporters on Thursday she has asked for warrants.

“What I've asked for, if they have warrants, show the warrants. In my experience, you've got to get a judicial warrant to arrest somebody,” she said.

Collins believes that “people who are in this country legally should not be targets of ICE investigations,"" according to Kernen.

Collins has also previously stated this.

Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said a proposed annual funding bill for DHS scheduled for Senate debate next week includes $20 million for body cameras and $2 million for de-escalation training, which she supports.

Citing the funding to supply Border Patrol and ICE agents with body cameras and train them in de-escalation tactics, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), whose 2nd Congressional District includes Lewiston, was one of seven Democrats to vote for the $64 billion DHS budget in the House of Representatives when it passed 220-207 on Thursday.

“Failure to fund DHS would undermine public safety and emergency response services. To me, that was never an option,” Golden said in a written statement. “By engaging in the process, rather than blocking it, we secured funding for body cameras and de-escalation training — two proven tactics embraced by law enforcement agencies across the country — that I believe will support responsible law enforcement and begin to restore trust.”

Besides ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), the bill also funds the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Golden has offered qualified support for the ICE operation in Maine.

“Federal law enforcement agencies have the right and responsibility to enforce federal laws, including immigration laws, and a targeted law enforcement operation focused on individuals who have engaged in criminal activity serves the public interest,” Golden said in a written statement after the first three days of stepped-up ICE activity. “Immigrants with legal status should not be targeted, court authorities should be obeyed, and due process must be followed.”

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), whose 1st Congressional District includes Portland, voted against the DHS budget and is denouncing the ICE activity and demanding “a full accounting” from the agency.

“Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers,” Pingree wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday.

“I am also outraged by multiple reports from Maine indicating that ICE agents engaged in brazenly intimidating and threatening behavior toward bystanders and local residents,” Pingree continued. “You state that you are no longer allowing American citizens to be terrorized, yet that is exactly what your agents are doing: terrorizing everyday Americans for practicing their legal rights.”

Pingree also said to Noem that branding the ICE surge as ""Operation: Catch of the Day"" is “dehumanizing, offensive, and wholly inappropriate for a federal law enforcement action involving real people, families, and communities.”

King told also told reporters Thursday that the “DHS budget is on the docket for next week in Washington, and I know that there are discussions going on right now and negotiations about what is going to be in that bill and how it will either facilitate or restrain the activities of ICE.”

King, Pingree, and Mills, who is running to unseat Collins in this year’s Senate race, have expressed frustration that DHS is keeping them in the dark about the ongoing ICE operation.

“Susan Collins could pick up the phone and get some answers, I am sure,” Mills said in an interview on MSNOW on Friday night. “I call upon Susan Collins to use her seniority and her power, of which she brags so often, as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to put a hold, to curtail further funding for ICE and Homeland Security until questions are answered, until they put a stop to this abusive behavior towards Maine people, towards Americans who are here lawfully present and just doing their job—paying taxes, contributing to our communities, raising families here.”

In another case, a father of a 5-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a U.S. citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a 5-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.

The events have sparked protests and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain you? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public versus a private space, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?

Legal experts weighed in on the public's constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.

What rights do people have when approached by ICE?

Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone — including immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

""All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,"" said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specializing in immigration cases.

The Fourth Amendment doesn't stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.

For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions — such as a brief detention that's not a formal arrest — require a ""reasonable suspicion"" that someone has committed a crime or is in the U.S. illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.

Reasonable suspicion ""has to be more than a guess or a presumption,"" said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed or would be committed.

Agents must meet an even higher bar to arrest someone. They need ""probable cause,"" which generally requires enough evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.

What is a ""Kavanaugh stop""?

Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.

In the 2025 case Noem v. Perdomo, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favor of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. Kavanaugh wrote that ""apparent ethnicity"" could be used as a ""relevant factor"" in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.

Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had ""often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they 'looked like an immigrant' or were in a high-crime area,"" Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh's guidance, ""it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile.""

Critics of Kavanaugh's opinion ""argue that the 'relevant factor' language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling,"" said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.

But Kavanaugh's opinion was not co-signed by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court ""has not made a definitive ruling on 'Kavanaugh stops' and their permissibility,"" said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump v. Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

Do people's rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?

The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.

""This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,"" Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as if an officer encounters a violent crime in progress, or someone needing medical care.

Securing a judicial warrant is time consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. ""It's much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,"" she said.

In the past, federal immigration officers typically would not forcibly enter homes if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE itself, without a judge's approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.

Specific ICE officials have authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require ""probable cause to believe"" that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.

A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press reported Jan. 22.

The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and ""those still in training are being told to follow the memo's guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo.""

The May 12, 2025, memo, signed by ICE acting director Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security ""has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence"" but added that ""the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.""

If this policy were to be challenged in court, it's unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.

What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?

If you believe that your rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, your options for suing for compensation are limited.

Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil lawsuits against federal officials for violating people's rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions, before tightening them again.

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley's law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, ""In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.""

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: ""It's not an easy path, and most people can't afford to retain a lawyer.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-15T111949Z_1207688221_RC241JADSQZL_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-POLL-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:56.830162

Any attempt to assault, stop, block, or otherwise hinder any law enforcement officers from doing their jobs will not be tolerated.","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — A protester was arrested in Orange County after tensions escalated outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Orlando.

The arrest happened as demonstrators gathered outside the ICE facility on Delegates Drive.

Channel 9 had a crew on the scene that witnessed the arrest. Dozens of law enforcement officers, who had staged nearby for the protest, responded within seconds to a call for backup.

Video from the scene shows whistles, sirens and protesters chanting as a person was handcuffed on the ground outside the facility. Another angle shows dozens of state troopers surrounding the protester and blocking the street.

The Orange County Sheriff’s office said the protest was almost exclusively peaceful until a woman approached a federal agent who was in a car and struck the law enforcement vehicle. She was arrested on charges of Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer and Resisting Arrest.

Protesters said the arrest followed a verbal exchange with a federal agent who was inside their car.

Just hours earlier, Channel 9 witnessed the arrestee peacefully protesting alongside others. Demonstrators said they were opposing what they described as an escalation of aggressive ICE tactics.

Many protesters said they were responding to a story Channel 9 broke earlier this month about ICE considering converting a warehouse in Orlando into a detention center. They also told Channel 9 they were responding to what they called “aggressive tactics” used by ICE in Minneapolis and in Central Florida.

“They need to block the acquisition of that warehouse. And we need to make it very clear that our jails are not a holding point for these nonviolent immigrants,” said John Held, who was part of the protest before the arrest.

The protest began at noon and was peaceful for several hours. During that time, law enforcement’s presence was visible with officers on bikes and in vehicles circling the area about every 30 minutes.

At least one counterprotester stood roughly 200 yards away, holding a Trump flag and yelling at demonstrators.

Orange County Republican Party Vice Chairman Kevin Kelly said he was supporting ICE’s mission.

“I just hope that people put more effort into positive actions like solving the absolute evil human trafficking problem that we have here and work together to solve those problems rather than running interference for folks that have broken the law,” said Kelly.

He also told Channel 9 he would support the detention center if ICE needed it to pursue law enforcement.

“We wanna be known as a safe, clean, fun place to bring your family on vacation. And if that means that there needs to be a detention center so they could adequately and safely process not only these offenders, but deal with again with these victims of human trafficking, then that seems like a necessary tool,” said Kelly.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Office released the following statement about the arrest:

“At the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, our top priority is the safety and security of our residents and visitors, and the safety of our deputies.

Earlier today, during what was almost an exclusively peaceful protest at the ICE facility, a woman approached a federal agent who was in a car and struck the law enforcement vehicle. She was arrested on charges of Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer and Resisting Arrest.

The right of all people to peacefully assemble or protest is fundamental, and a cornerstone of every American’s First Amendment right to free speech. What is not protected, however, is the destruction of property or violence against any member of our community. Any attempt to assault, stop, block, or otherwise hinder any law enforcement officers from doing their jobs will not be tolerated. I want to assure everyone in our community that our deputies will always respond to ensure the safety of those who are exercising their rights peacefully.”

Dozens of eateries, attraction sites and other businesses shuttered as part of a day of coordinated action to defy the weeks-long federal immigration operation underway in Minnesota.

Images of an apparently terrified pre-schooler, Liam Conejo Ramos, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father have rekindled public outrage at the federal crackdown, during which an agent shot and killed a US citizen.

The superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a preschool student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias – both asylum seekers – were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on Tuesday.

Ramos was then used as ""bait"" by officers to draw out those inside his home, superintendent Zena Stenvik added.

One protester, who declined to be named, said he was marching ""because if we don't fight, we don't win. If we don't fight, fascism wins.""

The local man held a sign reading ""five-years-old, dude,"" a reference to Ramos.

Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants across the country.

On a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed Ramos was among those detained. But he argued that agents were protecting him after his father ""ran"" from officers.

""What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?"" he said.

UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the ""harmful treatment of migrants and refugees"".

Arias, the father of the boy, was at a Texas detention facility, according to an ICE database that does not list the whereabouts of under-18s.

'Experts in dealing with children'

Border Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers' treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: ""I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children.""

ICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday ""my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family"" and alleged that Ramos's family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.

They would be detained ""pending their immigration proceedings"", he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were ""deportable"".

Ramos's teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him ""a bright young student"".

In Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted ""ICE out"" as part of a broader anti-ICE day of action.

Separately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis-St. Paul airport over the facility's use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids.

Methodist pastor Mariah Furness Tollgaard said in a statement that 100 members of clergy were arrested and charged with trespassing and disobeying a peace officer on Friday, while demonstrating at the airport.

""As a faith leader in Minnesota, my tradition teaches that every person bears the image of God and is worthy of dignity and safety, and in this moment, all people of faith and moral conscience must stand up,"" she said.

'Just a baby'

Former US vice president Kamala Harris said she was ""outraged"" by Ramos's detention and called him ""just a baby"".

Ramos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, administrators said.

Minneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.

An autopsy concluded that the killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.

The officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.

Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Children have been caught up in immigration enforcement under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Minnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application Monday.

Alma Hernandez sharply criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for stopping a car and arresting three members of a Venezuelan family near an elementary school just south of Downtown Tucson on Friday morning.

A woman who had been riding in the car told Hernandez that her husband had been driving her to a doctor's appointment, when he noticed a car was tailgating them. The ICE agents activated lights on a black SUV and pulled the family over, and said they were just conducting a ""routine operation"" and that they simply were ""just checking,"" the Democratic legislator said she was told.

""All of this happened in front of an elementary school while children were outside playing,"" Hernandez said in a prepared statement. ""This kind of recklessness is unacceptable.""

Hernandez represents District 20, which covers part of Midtown Tucson, and extends west of Interstate 10 toward the Pascua Yaqui.

Hernandez posted a video of the incident on Friday, showing three ICE agents standing outside the school. As one agent spoke with a woman, another argued with a small crowd, telling one man, ""you love your job, I love mine.""

Another man criticized the agents for making the stop near the school, telling him the children can't go to recess because the agents are nearby.

""This family was not breaking any law. In fact, this family is currently in their asylum process as they are from Venezuela, they all had proper documentation to show they are legally here while their case is being processed, and her husband the driver has already been granted asylum,"" Hernandez said. ""ICE was made aware of this and still took them.""

""This puts families, children, and entire neighborhoods like mine at risk, and demonstrates a blatant disregard for public safety,"" Hernandez said.

The stop was one of three reported incidents in Tucson involving ICE agents. ICE agents also detained a group of city of Tucson workers at a QuickTrip convenience store on Irvington Road on Friday.

ICE has accelerated operations in the Tucson area in January, including multiple incidents near El Super, a grocery store near South Tucson.

For weeks, activists in Tucson have waited for a push by ICE, especially after two high-profile raids in early December. One raid devolved into chaos as agents with the Department of Homeland Security used tear gas, pepper balls and smoke grenades against protesters.

Among those hit by pepper spray were this Tucson Sentinel reporter and U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva. Another reporter had his camera sprayed.

This worry has only increased after immigration agents surged into Minneapolis, and an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Last week, Tucson city officials sent out a statement on potential ICE raids in the city.

""Federal actions are spreading fear and chaos in cities across our country,"" said Mayor Regina Romero. ""The actions that we’ve seen ICE take are hurting innocent people and not making us any safer. The city of Tucson will prioritize community safety and protect the legal and constitutional rights of every Tucsonan regardless of status,"" Romero said, adding city staff created an informational website

City officials added there have been ICE operations in the city.

""While the mayor and city cannot prevent ICE from legally operating in Tucson, the city also does not condone the behavior demonstrated by ICE agents towards members of our community and in other communities,"" city officials said. ""This includes the wearing of masks and other actions intended to intimidate and confuse the public. The city understands that ICE raids create fear that negatively impact families, schools, and local businesses.""

However, the Tucson City Council unanimously asked staff to draft an ordinance barring ICE agents from using city-owned property to launch operations.

While the Trump administration has framed the large-scale crackdowns by ICE as way to remove the ""worst of the worst,"" available data shows ICE operations largely fall on immigrants who have not committed crimes, and those following the legal immigration processes created by Congress or under the Biden administration.

Data from ICE compiled by the nonpartisan Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows there were nearly 66,000 people in immigration detention on Nov. 30, and of those nearly 74 percent had no criminal convictions.

And, there are around 3.4 million immigration cases on the court docket, including around 2.3 million asylum cases.

Further, though the Trump administration has targeted immigrants throughout the U.S., the administration has a particular animus for Venezuelans.

In 2023, President Joe Biden issued TPS for Venezuelans in the U.S., deciding conditions in the country were too deleterious to deport people. As part of this decision, Biden extended TPS for Venezuelans who already had sought those protections, and he allowed those who arrived after 2021 to apply for TPS for the first time and receive a 18-month reprieve, wrote the American Immigration Council.

However, just days after January's inauguration, the Trump administration moved to cancel TPS for around 3,500 people from Venezuela.

""TPS holders sued the administration over the bait-and-switch,"" wrote AIC. However, while a federal judge postponed the cancellations and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration what it desired in May.

Since Trump's inauguration last year, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, the Arizona Mirror reported.

Experts said these moves created the ""most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history"" after the Trump administration slashed TPS for nearly 1 million and ended humanitarian parole for half a million more.

Further, in March, the Trump administration rendered about 240 Venezuelans to El Salvador's notoriously brutal CECOT prison, igniting a legal fight over their renditions without due process.

""Our community will not be complicit in systems that dehumanize our residents or erode public trust,"" Hernandez said Friday. ""We deserve safety rooted in dignity, accountability, and humanity, not fear.""

""These actions do not make our communities safer,"" Hernandez said. ""They terrorize neighborhoods, tear families apart, and undermine public trust—especially when carried out by masked agents operating with no transparency or accountability. What happened today is exactly why so many people in Tucson are living in fear: Fear of detention, deportation, and criminalization simply for existing.""

This is a blatant subversion of constitutional government — and one that harms undocumented immigrants and US citizens alike.
The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump’s enforcement agencies.
Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America’s 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can.
And it has never been more clear that Trump’s immigration agenda does precisely that.","Editor’s note, January 24, 12 pm ET: Federal agents shot a person in Minneapolis on Saturday morning, according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The shooting appeared to be captured on video, which shows federal agents wrestling someone to the ground and shooting them multiple times. The story below was originally published on January 23.

America’s immigration debate has often centered on the morality of mass deportation. Progressives have argued that exiling law-abiding families is inherently wrong — no matter their immigration status. Conservatives have insisted that vigorous internal enforcement is necessary for deterring chaotic inflows of migrants, upholding America’s laws, and preserving our nation’s culture.

This is an important dispute. And yet, as masked US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents run amok in Minneapolis, it also feels increasingly beside the point.

President Donald Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement doesn’t only threaten the welfare of the undocumented but also the basic rights of American citizens. The question posed by Trump’s agenda is not merely whether noncriminal immigrants should be deported, but whether the Constitution should be shredded in service of that aim.

Voters are starting to recognize this reality. In a recent New York Times/Siena poll, Americans approved of Trump’s deportations of people living in the country illegally by a 50 percent to 47 percent margin. Yet, over 60 percent nevertheless disapproved of the way that ICE was handling its job, saying that the agency had “gone too far” in its tactics.

It is important for Americans to understand that they don’t need to accept the left’s moral assumptions to reject the president’s immigration regime. They simply need to value their own freedom.

Below, I detail six ways that Trump’s immigration policies are eroding all Americans’ liberty.

Key takeaways

ICE is forcibly entering Americans’ homes without warrant.

The Trump administration is using immigration enforcement to punish speech it doesn’t like.

The White House is shielding ICE officers from accountability.

All this threatens US citizens, not just undocumented immigrants.

1) ICE is nullifying the Fourth Amendment

The Fourth Amendment bars government agents from forcing their way into a US resident’s home without a warrant. This protection from unreasonable search and seizure is among Americans’ most basic civil liberties — and ICE has decided to ignore it.

In an internal memo leaked this week, the agency informed its deportation officers that they can forcibly enter the homes of suspected undocumented immigrants without obtaining a warrant from any judge. ICE decreed that its agents could break into anyone’s house, so long as they had an administrative warrant, a type of warrant that ICE itself can issue at will.

This is a blatant subversion of constitutional government — and one that harms undocumented immigrants and US citizens alike. If ICE doesn’t need to establish probable cause before storming into a residence, then it will inevitably march into some American citizens’ homes.

Indeed, last Sunday, in St. Paul, Minnesota, ICE agents broke down the door of a house, put a gun to the head of a US citizen, and dragged him out of his home in just his underwear — all without presenting any judicial warrant.

2) The government is shielding ICE officers from accountability

A core democratic freedom is protection from abuse by armed agents of the state. The Trump administration has undermined such liberty by insulating DHS officers from legal accountability.

It has done this in ways both large and small.

Most conspicuously, when ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Nicole Good three times on video — twice while standing safely to the left of her vehicle — Trump immediately rallied to Ross’s defense. And the Department of Justice swiftly declined to investigate the shooting, opting instead to launch a probe against Good’s widow.

This conduct would be alarming even if Good’s killing were legally justified. By embracing Ross’s cause — before any investigation had been conducted — the president signaled that he will reflexively defend any use of force by ICE agents, no matter how grave or legally ambiguous.

Even before Good’s death, however, the administration had already demonstrated that it wished to immunize ICE from accountability. Upon taking office, Trump’s White House shuttered the DHS’s internal watchdog offices — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — which sought to protect detainees against abuse and unfair treatment. The latter office investigated more than 11,000 complaints in 2023.

Meanwhile, the administration condoned the decision of many ICE agents to operate in masks and plainclothes. This policy enables abuse by making it harder for the mistreated to identify abusive officers, and thus hold them to account.

Critically, all this is consistent with Trump’s own stated beliefs about how law enforcement officers should be allowed to operate. Speaking of his federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police in August, Trump touted that, on his watch, police would be “allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” He has also specifically said that when protesters throw rocks at ICE vehicles, the officers become entitled to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS” using “whatever means is necessary to do so.”

3) Trump is using immigration enforcement to deter free speech

Trump sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.

This is not conjecture but a description of the administration’s official policy.

Earlier this year, Trump declared, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” further promising to “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”

This stance would be illiberal, even if the president were referring exclusively to genuine supporters of Hamas; the government should not revoke legal status from people on the basis of speech, no matter how reprehensible.

In reality, though, the administration’s complaint was with any immigrant who advocated for a staunchly pro-Palestinian point of view.

In March 2025, Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national residing in the US on a student visa, co-authored an op-ed in her university’s newspaper, calling on it to divest from Israel and acknowledge the “Palestinian genocide.” This speech act put Öztürk on the radar of pro-Israel activists.

Upon taking office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Öztürk’s visa. Six masked, plainclothes DHS agents proceeded to abduct her off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, and send her to an ICE processing facility in southern Louisiana.

The ostensible rationale for this was that Öztürk had engaged in pro-Hamas activities. But internal State Department documents, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed that the government possessed no evidence that Öztürk had ever publicly advocated for Hamas or participated in anti-semitic activities.

The administration has similarly sought to revoke legal status from two lawful permanent residents — Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — who participated in pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University.

Federal courts have disputed the legality of all these actions, although Khalil presently faces a deportation order.

4) The administration is openly flouting due process

Even those who favor strict immigration enforcement should support immigrants’ due process rights. After all, it is due process that prevents the government from deporting lawful US residents (either by mistake or design).

Yet Trump has explicitly called for ending due process in immigration cases and taken various actions consistent with that authoritarian ambition.

During his first term, Trump declared that the government should be able to deport undocumented immigrants “with no judges or court cases.” Since taking office a second time, the president has sought to curtail legal protections for those accused of being in the country illegally.

First, his administration has expanded the use of “expedited removal” — a process that allows immigration authorities to deport the undocumented rapidly, without a full hearing. Historically, this process was used in a narrow set of circumstances: when an immigrant is intercepted near the US border without a valid visa, credible asylum claim, or proof that they have been in the US for longer than two weeks.

The idea here was that migrants who have just crossed the border do not possess the same legal protections as longtime residents. In some sense, they are still seeking admission into the country, rather than permission to remain in it. Therefore, Congress and the judiciary concluded that the government could deny such migrants a full court hearing, in the interests of administrative efficiency, particularly when border agents were overwhelmed by large inflows of asylum seekers.

But Trump has sought to authorize expedited removal throughout the United States. Under his guidance, DHS has proposed a rule that would empower ICE to summarily deport any suspected immigrants who can’t immediately prove that they’ve been in America for two years.

The risks of this policy to lawful US residents isn’t merely theoretical. Even in the absence of such broad authorities, ICE and the Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) have wrongfully detained or deported legal residents, including American citizens. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and removed 70.

Courts have intervened to block Trump’s expanded use of expedited removal, but the administration is appealing those rulings.

Meanwhile, the president has sought to corrupt the independence of the immigration court system. Since taking office in January, 139 immigration judges have been fired, nudged from the bench with an early retirement offer, or involuntarily transferred. The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump’s enforcement agencies.

Finally, and most appallingly, Trump has infamously deported longtime US residents — who’d been convicted of no crime — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where inmates are reportedly subject to torture and indefinite dentention. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration deported a resident unlawfully, and then claimed that it was powerless to reverse its mistake, since Garcia was now in the custody of a foreign power. The judiciary eventually forced the administration to return Garcia to the US. But his case illustrates the extremity of Trump’s contempt for due process.

5) Trump is normalizing the use of the military for civil law enforcement

Trump has also deployed federal troops to oversee immigration enforcement operations, in defiance of local political authorities.

This is a severe breach of liberal democratic norms. Immigration enforcement is a civil authority. And in the United States, responsibility for upholding civil laws is supposed to lie with civilian officials — not the military — except under the most extraordinary circumstances. This division of powers is codified in the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of armed forces for domestic policing absent explicit congressional authorization.

The administration has flouted this convention by invoking an obscure 1903 law, which authorizes the president to call up the National Guard if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Yet Trump has effectively defined such a rebellion as any public protest — even nonviolent ones — against immigration enforcement. In a June memorandum, Trump authorized the Guard’s deployment to any “locations where protests against” ICE functions “are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.” In other words, he asserted the authority to send the military anywhere in the US where a protest against his immigration policy is happening — or where his administration thinks a protest against its policy could happen.

The danger that this poses to democracy is straightforward. Unlike civilian police forces, the armed services operate at the president’s command. If his use of the military for civilian functions isn’t tightly constrained, there is a risk that he could exploit his martial authorities to insulate his regime from democratic control. Today, Trump is asserting the right to deploy troops to Democratic cities, to preempt protests he does not like. Tomorrow, he could do the same to obstruct the election of politicians he opposes.

Of course, that catastrophic outcome is far from guaranteed. But it is important to maintain institutional obstacles to it. Instead, Trump’s immigration agenda is eroding them.

6) The pursuit of indiscriminate, mass deportation imposes inherent costs to civil liberties

To this point, I’ve been outlining reasons why one should consider Trump’s immigration policies anti-democratic, even if one regards mass deportation as legitimate.

But it’s also true that any attempt to deport millions of noncriminal, undocumented immigrants is bound to impose costs on Americans’ civil liberties.

The case for concentrating immigration enforcement on law-breakers is not just humanitarian. Undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes are already known to the government and typically in its custody. As a result, DHS can remove them from the country without conducting sweeps that ensnare legal US residents.

Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America’s 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can. And that has led them to embrace tactics like going door to door in a Chicago apartment building, demanding families prove their legal status in the middle of the night; storming car washes and throwing senior citizens to the ground; and fining legal immigrants for not carrying proof of their status on their person at all times.

To refrain from these tactics, and set narrower enforcement priorities, is not to nullify America’s immigration statutes. The rule of law has never depended on perfect enforcement. Most crimes committed in the United States go unpunished, including nearly half of murders. We should obviously try to change that. But the only way to push the rate of unpunished criminality to anywhere near 0 percent would be to embrace gross violations of civil liberties: The government would need to surveil more or less all citizens more or less all of the time.

Most Americans would regard such enforcement as authoritarian. And so we instead accept that the police will prioritize the prevention and punishment of certain crimes, while acquiescing to a great deal of uncensured lawbreaking. Immigration enforcement entails similar trade-offs.

That doesn’t mean that any enforcement regime broader than Joe Biden’s is fascism. But I would encourage those unmoved by humanitarian objections to mass deportation to consider the inherent, civil libertarian costs of such a policy.

In any event, reasonable people can disagree about exactly how the government should balance the objectives of enforcing borders and honoring civil liberties. What should be beyond dispute, however, is that eroding Americans’ most basic constitutional rights is never legitimate. And it has never been more clear that Trump’s immigration agenda does precisely that.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2256434210.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.723165084465%2C100%2C78.55366983107&w=1200,N,,2026-01-24 14:58:12.512493

But their eventual ruling following this week's arguments in the case may not give Cook a sweeping victory.

Rather, according to some legal experts, a likely outcome would be a narrow decision that could return the matter to a trial court for more fact-finding without the justices resolving ​big questions involving whether Trump has proper cause to oust Cook or whether a president has the power to fire Fed officials. In such a scenario, the case could return later to the Supreme Court.

The Week in Breakingviews newsletter offers insights and ideas from Reuters' global financial commentary team. Sign up here.

Trump's attempt to fire Cook and ‌a separate criminal investigation launched by his Justice Department against Fed Chair Jerome Powell together represent the biggest challenge to the central bank's independence since its founding in 1913.

A 'MINIMALIST' DECISION

""The Supreme Court clearly seems to be looking for a way to get the case back to the lower courts with as minimalist of a decision as possible,"" said law professor Peter Margulies of Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, ""rather than a broad pronouncement.""

Trump's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to block U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's September preliminary injunction that halted his attempt to fire Cook the prior month. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the administration's subsequent request to lift Cobb's order.

A narrow Supreme Court ruling against Trump would leave Cobb's injunction in place and provide instructions to the judge about how to move the case toward a final judgment on the merits of Cook's legal challenge to the Republican president's bid to remove ‌her.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has backed Trump in numerous other cases decided on an emergency basis since he returned to office 12 months ago, including letting him remove officials from other federal ​agencies.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law that included provisions meant to insulate it from political interference, allowing a president to remove central bank governors only ""for cause."" The law does not define ""cause"" or establish procedures for removal.

Trump, who has taken a broad view of presidential powers under the U.S. Constitution, is the first president to try to fire a Fed official.

Economists view central bank independence as indispensable to prevent interest rate decisions from being dictated by the short-term whims of politicians at the expense of long-term economic stability.

'A HURRIED MANNER'

During the arguments on Wednesday, some of the justices ‍noted that Cook's case moved quickly to them, with little time for weighing evidence and resolving complex legal questions.

Conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked: ""Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody - by the executive branch, by the district court, by the D.C. Circuit - in such a hurried manner?""

Cook sued Trump days after he posted to his Truth Social platform a letter informing her that she was ""hereby removed.""

Trump said he had proper cause to fire Cook, citing unproven allegations made by one of his political appointees that she had falsified documents to obtain loans on two different properties she listed as her primary residences. Cook has called these allegations ⁠of mortgage fraud a pretext to remove her over monetary policy, as the Fed has resisted Trump's persistent demands for fast and big interest rate cuts.

Alito said he did not think Cobb had created a full evidentiary record of Trump's basis for removing Cook.

""No court has ever explored ‍those facts,"" Alito said. ""Are the mortgage applications even in the record in this case?""

The justices ""are wary of the relative paucity of the material for them to go on,"" said law professor Jane Manners of Fordham University in New York.

'IRREPARABLE HARM'

The burden is on Trump to show he is entitled to a stay, or halt, ‌of Cobb's preliminary ‌injunction. The administration must show Trump would be irreparably harmed if a stay is not granted. The justices must also consider whether a stay serves the public interest more broadly.

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted that economists had filed briefs with the court arguing that granting Trump's request to remove Cook immediately could trigger a recession, and asked whether that risk meant the court should proceed cautiously.

""The court could cite the irreparable harm factor and say the public interest isn't clearly served by allowing removal at this point, particularly because of questions about effects on the markets,"" Margulies said.

Boston University law professor Jed Shugerman said it is possible the Supreme Court's ruling could come in the form of a one-paragraph order that denies Trump's request for a stay but does not provide much if any legal reasoning. The court, for example, took that approach in an immigration case last year involving ⁠Trump that it decided on an emergency basis.

DUE PROCESS RIGHTS

The trial judge ⁠ruled that Trump's attempt to remove Cook without notice or a ​hearing likely violated her right to due process under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment and that the mortgage fraud allegations likely were not a sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law.

Shugerman said Wednesday's arguments revealed skepticism among the justices toward Trump's legal arguments but a lack of consensus on how to interpret the law that created the Fed, what ""for cause"" means and how to distinguish the Fed from other government agencies.

Rather than delve into these questions in their pending ruling, the justices could kick them down the road and revisit them later with the benefit of further work by the lower courts, Shugerman said.

""I think they hinted ‍at oral argument - if not said explicitly - that they find these issues too historically complicated and too legally complicated to be worthwhile to dig into at this stage,"" Shugerman said.

Some legal experts said the justices might rule in favor of Cook in a more forceful way that brings the case to an end. The court could rule, for example, that the process afforded to Cook to challenge the accusations against her was insufficient.

But such a ruling still would be narrow in the sense that it would ""avoid the question of why independence is necessary and important for the Fed and just focus on procedure,"" said professor Andrea Katz of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.

For ​his part, Trump said a day after the arguments that he did not get the impression that the court seemed skeptical of his bid to fire Cook.

""I didn't get ‍that impression other than they thought maybe it should have gone through a more normal court system,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

The court's ruling is expected by the end of June but could come sooner.

MINNEAPOLIS — Today, federal agents shot and killed a man in the Eat Street neighborhood of south Minneapolis after brutally beating him in front of witnesses. Video from an on-the-ground reporter reveals that multiple shots were fired, with the agents believed to be standing over the man when he was struck, apparently in his chest. The American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of Minnesota strongly condemn this killing and demand these violent and dangerous federal agents immediately withdraw from Minnesota — and other communities across the country.

“Yesterday tens of thousands of Minnesotans from all walks of life marched through the streets in subzero temperatures to demand ICE stop terrorizing our communities, and today we wake up to the heartbreaking news that federal officials killed another person. ,” said Deepinder Mayell, executive director of ACLU of Minnesota. “This tragedy is further proof that these federal agents are out of control and critically endangering our communities. ICE and CBP must end their operations in our city before anyone else is harmed, and an independent investigation must be conducted.”

In July 2025, Congress voted to add an unprecedented $170 billion to the Trump administration’s already massive budget for immigration enforcement, which has funded these indiscriminate raids. Congress is now negotiating the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) budget for the coming year, which would fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol, enabling them to continue their lawless operations across the country without adding any serious limits on their abusive and violent tactics.

“After the horrific shooting of Renee Good, the Trump administration recklessly escalated and deployed even more heavily armed agents into Minneapolis, and, today, we are again seeing the devastating and predictable consequences,” said Naureen Shah, director of immigration policy and government affairs at ACLU. “Congress must rein ICE in before what happened in Minneapolis happens yet again. Senators must reject a DHS budget that allows these lawless agencies to continue putting our communities in danger.”

In recent weeks, the ACLU of Minnesota and its partners filed two lawsuits arising from ICE’s assault on Minnesotans, Hussen v. Noem, challenging the agency’s warrantless arrests and racial profiling, and Tincher v. Noem, a lawsuit challenging ICE violence and misconduct towards Minnesotans exercising their First Amendment rights to assemble, observe, and protest federal agents’ immigration enforcement activities in our streets. Earlier this week, a federal appeals court temporarily suspended the trial court’s order in Tincher blocking the government from retaliating against protestors and observers.

""In fact, I have evidence to the contrary that the federal government is investigating the death of Renee Good at all,"" Ellison told CBS News in an interview Friday.

He added, ""Todd Blanche, who is the No. 2 at DOJ, said they're not investigating.""

At the same time, Minnesota authorities, Ellison said, are seeking a ""full, fair and joint investigation.""

""In Minnesota, if you are killed — particularly if you're killed…in connection with an action by an official federal or state, we will investigate your death,"" Ellison said.

The state agency tasked with investigating Good's killing, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, withdrew from a joint investigation with the FBI a day after the shooting. It said in a statement at the time the agency said it had been informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office that ""the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.""

When asked in a Jan. 18 interview with ""Face the Nation"" whether the ICE officer who shot Good was under investigation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the department was ""following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE, and under the Department of Homeland Security, and within the administration.""

Ellison on the apprehension of 5-year-old Liam Ramos by ICE

Ellison strongly disputed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's assertions about 5-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into ICE custody outside his home. Ramos' image has been widely circulated across the news and social media in a photo that shows him wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack. DHS said the boy had been ""abandoned.""

""I don't buy that at all. In fact, there are very credible people who know Liam who refute that. I believe them over ICE,"" Ellison said, calling DHS' claim and subsequent treatment of Ramos ""another example of atrocity"" tied to the deportation effort DHS has dubbed ""Operation Metro Surge.""

Witnesses told CBS News that ICE used the boy as bait to lure family members out.

""That is morally repugnant and nothing the federal government should ever be associated with,"" Ellison said.

Suing to stop DHS' warrantless arrests in Minnesota

Ellison's office and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop what they allege are unlawful tactics, framing the surge as a planned deployment targeting Minnesota, not a routine enforcement action. He argued the operation has been fueled by President Trump's anger over losing the 2020 presidential election.

""Mr. Trump said 'retribution.' He said he won Minnesota three times and that leaders here wrongfully denied him. So he's mad at us,"" Ellison said. Asked whether the ICE operation is about politics, rather than law enforcement, he replied, ""It's 100% about politics and retribution.""

DHS alleges leaders in Minnesota ""created disorder"" by failing to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Ellison called this ""a false statement"" and said planning for the surge of federal law enforcement had long been underway. He said he believes U.S. officials are shifting their rationale now because public opinion is turning against the operation.

At the center of the lawsuit, Ellison said, are accusations of warrantless arrests without individualized assessment — including alleged civil immigration arrests without probable cause — along with racial profiling and what he described as excessive detention.

DHS has claimed that there are a few arrest videos that were taken out of context.

""Yeah, well, they're going to have to defend their position in court, because that's not true,"" Ellison replied.

If he's successful in obtaining an injunction blocking the DHS operation in Minnesota, it's not clear whether the state could enforce it — or that it would survive appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ellison acknowledged that uncertainty but said inaction was not an option.

""The only alternative is to do nothing and hope for the best,"" he said. ""We have to do all that is in our power to insist that the federal government obey the law.""

Ellison said the DHS surge is imposing significant costs on state and local governments, with ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" spent daily on crowd control, overtime and emergency response.

He also described a stream of injury complaints tied to pepper spray, tear gas and ""less lethal munitions,"" adding that ""literally dozens every day"" are making reports, while also emphasizing the harms of what he called unlawful detention and imprisonment.

And pressed on whether the state would subpoena federal agents in its civil case to access evidence in the Good case, Ellison said legal and ethical constraints govern the boundary between civil litigation and criminal investigations, but he did not rule it out.

""We're going to do what is legal and ethical,"" he said.

ICE's new authority to carry out warrantless searches

ICE agents have seen their authority expanded — a May memo that was recently disclosed by whistleblowers said agents are authorized to use force to enter homes without a judicial warrant. Ellison called the policy ""unconstitutional"" and said he's heard reports it's being used in Minnesota. He signaled the state would challenge such actions.

Cooperation with ICE

DHS has said that Minnesota is not cooperating with ICE detainers — requests to hold detainees for an additional 48 hours so they can be turned over to ICE custody — or other requests for assistance. Ellison counters that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility — not the state's — and while Minnesota is not a sanctuary state, state laws and court orders sometimes prevent the state from assisting ICE because it cannot hold criminals beyond their sentence.

For instance, he said that if an individual sought by the federal government is arrested for driving under the influence, ""our courts don't have the legal authority to hold them once the court has said they need — they are to be released.""

He indicated that the state is following its laws as they're written: ""They're asking us to join them in breaking the law, and we can't do that. We believe in upholding the law.""

But cooperation with ICE detainers is uneven in Minnesota. In Hennepin County, where Minneapolis is located, the sheriff told CBS News that authorities do not notify ICE when detainees are released back into the community. The Department of Corrections, however, does notify ICE.

DHS says that if every county in the state coordinated with ICE, federal agents could go home and ICE would not continue to conduct raids in Minnesota.

""They're saying, 'Oh, well, if you only would tell us, do our job for us, then we could go home.' No, you didn't,"" Ellison said. He added, ""ICE needs to do its job that it is paid to do, and it has a massive budget to do.""

""Minnesota is not a sanctuary state,"" he told CBS News. ""We don't do the federal government's job, but we don't in any way obstruct them from doing their job.""

He suggested his state is at the center of a collision between politics and constitutional rights and warned that ""the only way to get along"" with the administration is to ""abandon constitutional rights.""

""We must insist upon our First Amendment right to vote for whoever we please and not be persecuted,"" he said. ""We must insist on the Fourth Amendment protection to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/24/8b7fcdd7-16df-41ed-804c-9785739b6b07/thumbnail/1200x630/b15d646828ed7ff73cb660fb5c686b15/1769221140124.png,N,,2026-01-24 16:58:59.356877

Part of the reason why recent ICE tactics have shocked Americans is because most people haven’t seen them before. Historically, the country’s militarized immigration enforcement practices have played out closer to the U.S.-Mexico border. And for decades, agents with Customs and Border Protection have carried out most deportations near the border, not ICE.

From 2010-2020, nearly 80% of all deportations were initiated at or near the U.S.-Mexico border. During the COVID-19 pandemic, that number jumped to 98%, as both the Trump and Biden administrations utilized Title 42, a public health statute that allowed the government to rapidly deport recently arrived migrants.

But Trump during his second presidency has greatly shifted immigration enforcement north into the interior of the U.S. And ICE has played a central role.

As international migration and human rights scholars, we have examined recent federal immigration policy to determine why ICE has become the main agency detaining and deporting migrants as far away from the southern border as snowy Minnesota.

And we have also explored how the transition in immigration control from the southern border to more Americans’ front lawns could be shifting the public’s views on deportation tactics.

Migration as a threat

ICE is a relatively new agency. The 2002 Homeland Security Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, created the Department of Homeland Security, known as DHS, by merging the U.S. Customs Service – previously under Treasury Department control – and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, formerly under the Justice Department.

DHS has 22 agencies, including three that focus on immigration: Customs and Border Protection, ICE and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which manages legal immigration and naturalization.

There is no inherent reason that immigration enforcement should fall under homeland security. But immigration was deemed a national security matter by the George W. Bush administration after 9/11.

In a 2002 presidential briefing justifying DHS’s creation, Bush said, “The changing nature of the threats facing America requires a new government structure to protect against invisible enemies that can strike with a wide variety of weapons.”

The U.S. government has viewed immigration from this national security perspective ever since.

The full impact of the deportations

The Trump administration in early 2025 set a goal of deporting 1 million people during its first year.

But with so few crossings, and thus deportations, at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration instead has focused its efforts on the U.S. interior.

Trump’s 2025 tax and budget bill reflected this reprioritization, allocating US$170 billion over four years to immigration enforcement, compared to approximately $30 billion allocated in 2024.

Roughly $67 billion goes toward immigration enforcement at the border, including border wall construction. But the largest percentage of the bill’s immigration funding – at least $75 billion – goes toward arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants already living in the U.S.

The Trump administration did not initiate deportations from the U.S. interior. They have formed part of other administration’s policies, both Democratic and Republican.

Interior border enforcement increased under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s with the introduction of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which widened the criteria for deportations. And former President Barack Obama was referred to as the “Deporter in Chief” after his administration carried out more than 3 million deportations over his two terms, with roughly 69% of deportations occurring at the border.

But the astronomical growth of government funding toward migration control – at the border and in the U.S. – got the country to where it is today.

Between fiscal year 2003 and 2024, for example, Congress allocated approximately $24 toward immigration enforcement carried out by ICE and CBP for every $1 spent on the immigration court system that handles asylum claims.

The new money allocated under the 2025 budget bill, and the reprioritization of immigration enforcement from the border to the interior, partly explains why Americans are now seeing the long-term consequences of border militarization play out directly in their communities.

Americans may not know about the experiences of migrants who are quickly deported near the border, but it is harder to ignore recent images of people snatched up within their own neighborhoods.

Now the visible targets of border enforcement are increasingly immigrants who have built their lives in the U.S. – neighbors, friends, co-workers – as well as anyone who opposes ICE’s tactics, like Renee Good.

Changing political attitudes

In fact, the violence of Trump’s mass deportation campaign may be changing how Americans view immigration.

Just before the 2024 presidential election, a Gallup Poll found that 28% of Americans believed that immigration was the most important problem facing the nation – the highest percentage since Gallup began tracking the topic in 1981. This number dropped to 19% in December 2025, reflecting how more Americans see immigration as a routine issue that the government can manage rather than a crisis that needs to be dealt with.

This is supported in the academic literature. Migration scholars have shown that voters often support strict immigration policies in the voting booth but resist and protest when governments attempt to implement those policies in organized immigrant communities.

In 2002, for example, migration scholar Antje Ellermann documented that immigration officers reported it was more difficult to detain and deport people in Miami – because of resistance by a politicized immigrant community – compared to relatively conservative and less organized communities in San Diego.

But in both places, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were influential in intervening in individual cases to prevent deportations. This is because senior immigration officials, Ellermann noted, were influenced by media attention and pressure by members of Congress to grant relief.

Support for Trump’s handling of immigration is trending downward. Only 41% of Americans approved of Trump’s approach to immigration as of early January 2026, compared to 51% in March of last year, according to CNN polling.

This declining support for Trump’s tactics comes as Republican senators such as Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa have criticized ICE and its operations in Minnesota.",https://www.bakerinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/file-20260123-66-q7nd0h_ICE%2BTactics-Conversation.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:15.029113

Mayor Solomon Signs Expansive Executive Order Protecting Jersey City's Immigrants

Executive Order Expands Training, Restricts Use of City Property for Immigration Enforcement, and Builds Legal Support Infrastructure

JERSEY CITY, NJ (January 23, 2026) – Mayor James Solomon today, at the historic Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal that welcomed millions of immigrants into the United States of America, signed a comprehensive Executive Order strengthening Jersey City's immigrant protections and ensuring immigrant families can live, work, and belong in the city without fear. The Order builds on Jersey City's existing protections by modernizing training protocols, prohibiting the use of City-owned property for federal immigration enforcement operations, and expanding access to know-your-rights resources and legal support.

""Jersey City has always been America's Golden Door. This city is a place built by immigrants, for immigrants,"" said Mayor James Solomon. ""More than 40% of our residents were born abroad. They are our neighbors, our co-workers, the parents at our kids' schools. When the federal government escalates tactics that terrorize families and undermine trust in local government, we have a responsibility to use every tool we have to protect our people.""

The Executive Order operationalizes Mayor Solomon's campaign commitment to defend and expand the city's immigrant communities through three concrete actions:

Citywide Training and Protocols for Encounters with Federal Immigration Authorities

All City employees will receive standardized training on their obligations under Jersey City law, including the legal limits of cooperation with federal immigration authorities and protocols for responding to requests for access to City property or resources. The Jersey City Division of Police will issue formal written guidance governing encounters with federal immigration authorities, including protocols for verifying judicial warrants, documenting interactions, preserving body-worn camera footage, and referring affected residents to City services.

""Our residents need to know that when they call 911, report a crime, or access City services, they're interacting with Jersey City employees, and not federal immigration enforcement,"" Mayor Solomon said. ""This training makes that clear.""

Prohibition on Use of City Property for Immigration Enforcement

The Order establishes a categorical ban on the use of City-owned or City-controlled property like parking lots, vacant lots, and garages - as staging areas, processing locations, or operational bases for immigration enforcement. City Departments will post clear signage on relevant properties and implement physical access controls where appropriate.

""City property exists to serve the people of Jersey City, not to facilitate federal operations that undermine community trust,"" Mayor Solomon said. ""We've seen what happens when local governments allow their resources to be commandeered for immigration raids. That won't happen here.""

Community Partnerships for Know-Your-Rights Outreach and Legal Support

The City will partner with immigrant-serving nonprofit organizations to conduct multilingual know-your-rights outreach and develop legal support infrastructure, including virtual legal clinics, referral pathways to qualified immigration counsel, and protocols for assisting residents whose family members have been detained. The City will explore immigration defense funding models used by other municipalities during prior periods of heightened federal enforcement.

The Executive Order preserves compliance with federal law and does not obstruct lawful immigration enforcement activities conducted independently of City property, personnel, or resources. It does not limit the City's cooperation with criminal judicial warrants.

Mayor Solomon emphasized that the Order reflects Jersey City's values and its practical interest in public safety and effective governance.

""Fear is a tax on all residents,"" said Mayor Solomon. ""When immigrant families are afraid to report crimes, access healthcare, or send their kids to school, everyone in this city is less safe. This Executive Order is about protecting our residents and ensuring that Jersey City remains a place where everyone can thrive.""

The Executive Order takes effect immediately.

""Jersey City is a proud and diverse community that has been made better by generations of immigrants,” said Congressman Rob Menendez. ""At a time when Trump is deploying ICE agents across the country to intimidate and terrorize our communities, it is more critical than ever for our allies and partners at all levels of government to take every step necessary to protect our residents. We must all work together to keep our residents safe and ensure that our friends, family members, and neighbors are treated with dignity and respect. I thank Mayor Solomon for his leadership and partnership on the critical work of protecting our communities from Trump’s extreme deportation agenda.""

“Jersey City was built by immigrants who came here looking for dignity and safety. Trump tried to target us for our sanctuary status, but we are not backing down. We won’t hand over our power to ICE. We will not sell out our neighbors,” said Congresswoman LaMonica McIver. “That’s why I am proud to fully support Mayor Solomon’s orders to keep Jersey City a sanctuary city. Our government is meant to protect our communities, not terrorize them.”

“Jersey City is taking action to protect our immigrant communities because trust between residents and local government makes all of us safer,” said Assemblyman Gabriel Rodriguez. “This Executive Order ensures families can access services, engage with their community, and live without fear.”

“These policies protect the rights and safety of Jersey City residents while respecting the rule of law,” said Assemblyman Jerry Walker. “By setting clear standards for City employees, prohibiting the use of City property for immigration enforcement, and expanding access to legal resources, Jersey City is strengthening transparency and community trust. I will continue to stand with the residents of the 31st Legislative District to ensure all families feel safe accessing City services without fear.”

“Welcome Home is a community-based organization that fosters successful long-term integration of immigrants who have resettled in Jersey City. We know from the lived experience of our friends that integration is not merely a process of survival, but a pursuit of meaning, dignity, and contribution,” said Dave Mammen, Welcome Home Jersey City. Immigrants are our neighbors and contributors to community life whose successful integration is a shared civic responsibility, but it cannot be achieved without legal safeguards that are the foundation for agency, safety, trust, and participation. We therefore applaud Mayor Solomon’s efforts to protect Jersey City’s immigrant residents through his Executive Order, and we stand ready to assist.”

The groups sued the Trump administration in March over its “ideological-deportation policy” after the arrest and attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the anti-Israel protest movement at Columbia University.
“Alone I have nothing but my sense of duty,” Young wrote in reply, in a space above the listed plaintiffs that is usually left blank.
“The court recommends that an advisory jury be empaneled to assist the court in deciding factual issues,” Young wrote.
They do not apply to any such members who were convicted of a crime or whose immigration status expired.","A federal judge ruled on Thursday that academic groups suing the Trump administration to halt the deportations of students and faculty who engaged in anti-Israel protests will be granted a blanket presumption that their activity is protected free speech under the First Amendment.

The ruling from judge William Young, a Reagan appointee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, shifts the burden to the government to prove that any change in the immigration status of members of the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association is justified.

“It shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.

The groups sued the Trump administration in March over its “ideological-deportation policy” after the arrest and attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the anti-Israel protest movement at Columbia University.

“While President Trump and other administration officials have described pro-Palestinian campus protests as ‘pro-Hamas,’ they have stretched that label beyond the breaking point to encompass any speech supportive of Palestinian human rights or critical of Israel’s military actions in Gaza,” the plaintiffs wrote.

“They have left no doubt that their new policy entails the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizen students and faculty for constitutionally protected speech and association,” they added in the complaint.

Young ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in September.

At a hearing earlier this month, Young described the actions of the Trump administration as “an unconstitutional conspiracy to pick off certain people” for their protests, Politico reported.

“I find it breathtaking that I have been compelled on the evidence to find the conduct of such high-level officers of our government—cabinet secretaries—conspired to infringe the First Amendment rights of people with such rights here in the United States,” Young said. “These cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.”

Young’s rulings in the case have raised eyebrows over his unusual commentary and suggestions.

In September, Young attached a hand-written postcard from an anonymous sender asking, “Trump has pardons and tanks … what do you have?” to the top of his ruling.

“Alone I have nothing but my sense of duty,” Young wrote in reply, in a space above the listed plaintiffs that is usually left blank. “Together, we the people of the United States—you and me—have our magnificent Constitution.”

Young’s ruling on Thursday includes more unusual remedies and commentary on the case.

“The court recommends that an advisory jury be empaneled to assist the court in deciding factual issues,” Young wrote. “The moral effect of a jury verdict cannot be overstated. The American jury is the most robust and vital expression of direct democracy extent in the world today.”

“The people’s participation in this act of government is long overdue,” he added.

The protections extended to the plaintiffs include only non-citizens, who were members of AAUP or MESA between the time the plaintiffs brought suit and Young’s decision on the case in September. They do not apply to any such members who were convicted of a crime or whose immigration status expired.

In an appendix to Thursday’s ruling, Young mused about potential applications of his decision involving situations not directly related to the case, including the hypothetical revocation of temporary protected immigration status to Venezuelans and comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

“If it’s just speech—it may be repulsive speech or disgusting speech, but if it’s just speech, well, the Department of State can’t do that,” Young wrote. “Again, this is a hypothetical. But let’s say that happened, we’ll assume that happened. And then the person comes in and says, ‘I’m a member of this class. You can’t do that to me.’”

“Well again, the government’s going to have to prove that their reason was not in fact in retribution,” he said, “and in addition, my second, that it’s an appropriate exercise of governmental power.”

In the U.S., there is no right to appointed counsel for immigration proceedings because they’re civil, not criminal, matters.","A retail worker arrested at a routine immigration check-in. A mother and a student, both asylum seekers, taken into custody. A civil engineer on a work visa and a corrections officer recruit, whose boss said he has a “squeaky clean” record and permission to work, both picked up during their commutes.

These are a few of the people U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have detained so far during their operation in Maine, which the agency said targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” Accounts from family members, employers and background checks of those five people failed to show evidence of criminal records. Meanwhile, the incomplete list of arrests that the federal government has shared so far included 13 people with criminal records of the nearly 100 ICE said it has arrested.

“The administration is taking 100% a dragnet approach to their operations,” said Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Part of that, Mehta said, is that cruelty is the point, designed to cause suffering and fear as a deterrent. But, it’s also happening because the government has the most information about immigrants who are already in proceedings, she said.

With the Trump administration’s stated goal of 1 million deportations per year, the easiest people to go after are those the government already has personal identifying information about, Mehta said — “people that are checking in at their immigration interviews, people that are going to immigration court proceedings, people that have temporary protected status, people that are, again, lawfully here.”

Available data underscores that. Not only has the number of people in detention surged during Trump’s second term, but also the percentage of ICE detainees with no criminal record. During the first nine months of Trump’s presidency, ICE arrested more than 74,000 people with no criminal record, amounting to more than a third of the total ICE arrests over that period, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project through a lawsuit against ICE.

Those figures don’t include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has reported record apprehensions in Maine, or people referred to ICE by other agencies.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, does not have complete information on all of the people who have been arrested in the first days of the operation in Maine but confirmed that several are asylum seekers following a lawful process.

Maine leaders demand warrants, information about ICE arrests

On Tuesday in Maine, ICE detained Yanick Joao Carneiro of Portland at a routine immigration check-in at the agency’s Scarborough field office without a warrant, according to the petition filed by his lawyer. An asylum seeker from Angola, Carneiro was waiting for an immigration court hearing in 2027. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.

Carneiro was the first person to challenge their detention after ICE began its increased enforcement in Maine, what the agency is calling “Operation Catch of the Day.”

“While some of the door-to-door and apartment building raids may be targeted, it is clear the overall operation is anything but targeted,” Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project Executive Director Sue Roche said. “People are being racially profiled on the streets and in their cars. As is their playbook, ICE is doing everything they can to inflict maximum cruelty and chaos.”

Arrests have become quicker and quieter, as opposed to the large workplace raids seen in Los Angeles last year. ICE is also reversing longstanding policy, according to an internal memo, by asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant.

“This is not the law as I understand it,” said Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney who now lives in Maine, “and it is not the law that [the U.S. Department of Justice] has historically applied.”

In Minnesota, where a federal agent’s fatal shooting of Renee Good sparked protests and subsequent deployment of thousands more agents, the federal government is re-examining the cases of refugees, who have gone through a robust screening process and are on a path to citizenship. During Trump’s second term, there have also been instances of judges tossing out asylum cases only for people to walk outside to find ICE waiting to arrest them.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Thursday demanded the federal government provide arrest numbers, warrants and basic information about who is being detained. DHS told reporters on Thursday that 100 people have been arrested in the operation so far, up from the 50 reported by Fox News two days prior.

When asked whether she has any reason to doubt the numbers provided by DHS, Mehta said, “I think it’s more that I don’t have any reason to trust the information.”

Mehta also said general arrest numbers don’t truly reveal what’s happening.

“What does arrest mean?” Mehta questioned. “They’ve also arrested a ton of U.S. citizens, arrested lawful permanent residents.”

Jean-Pierre Obiang, an 18-year-old student at the University of Southern Maine, was detained after being involved in a minor traffic accident outside of Market Basket in Westbrook on Tuesday. He and his mother are asylum seekers from Gabon and have lived in Maine for three years.

In Portland on Wednesday, agents detained Micheline Ntumba after she dropped off one of her four children at Portland High School, her daughter told the Maine Monitor. Her daughter said Ntumba, who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has a pending asylum claim and has been in the U.S. for nearly 10 years.

Then Wednesday night, ICE agents arrested a Cumberland County corrections officer recruit, whose name has not been shared — leading County Sheriff Kevin Joyce to publicly question the agency’s priorities.

Every corrections hire has to fill out documentation that proves they’re legally allowed to work in the U.S. and undergo background checks including on criminal history. The recruit had a “squeaky clean record,” as Joyce described it.

“The book and the movie do not line up,” Joyce said, referring to ICE’s claims that they’re focused on criminals. He later added, “We’re being told one story, which is totally different than what’s occurring.”

On Thursday, agents took Juan Sebastian Carvajal-Munoz, a civil engineer, in Portland while he was on his way to work. Carvajal-Munoz, who is from Colombia and in the U.S. on a work visa, has since been released, according to one of his colleagues.

DHS and ICE have not responded to questions about the basis for any of these detentions.

Agents smashed Carvajal-Munoz’s car window and left the car running after taking him. Portland police officers went to the area after a report of a disturbance but identified no public safety concerns and did not take custody of the car, said spokesperson Brad Nadeau. The corrections officer’s car was also left after ICE detained him in Portland’s Bayside neighborhood.

“They left it right on the side of the street,” Joyce said. “Folks, that’s bush league policing.”

Across the country, federal agents have also left people’s vehicles and other personal belongings behind. The city of St. Paul paused the towing of abandoned vehicles due to the ICE surge in Minnesota.

In Maine, the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and community organizers are mapping out a plan for a more coordinated system to return items to the family members of those detained. That type of grassroots effort to create de facto middle men has been seen in other states, too.

Additionally, Maine organizers are helping loved ones get connected with legal counsel, as detention presents inherent challenges for due process.

In the U.S., there is no right to appointed counsel for immigration proceedings because they’re civil, not criminal, matters. People in detention are less likely to get an attorney because facilities are often located in remote areas and because there are few places where attorneys can meet with their clients while they’re in custody, even by phone.

In turn, Mehta said, that means people are left trying to navigate the complex system themselves and often unable to make claims.

“You have people going through a faster, much more unfair process, where they are functionally being processed by the immigration court and expedited into a deportation system,” she said. “I think it would be absurd to pretend that it is a benefit for someone to be going through the proceedings while they’re in detention.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-ice-sign-3-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:58:17.649973

This week, The Associated Press revealed an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo issued in May 2025. It authorizes agents to enter a private home to make an arrest without first obtaining a warrant signed by a judge. The guidance — which numerous legal experts say likely violates the Fourth Amendment — represents just the latest flashpoint in a dizzying year of efforts by the Trump administration to expand the enforcement of immigration law.

Those efforts have included attempts to stretch the use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act, the controversial transfers of some detainees to a violent prison in El Salvador, and a rapid push to expand U.S. detention capacity — first with tents, and, as recently reported, into industrial warehouses as well.

These intensified enforcement efforts have led to record-setting numbers of people in immigration detention — about 73,000 as of this week — and to sustained media coverage and public outcry.

But even as immigration actions have dominated the spotlight, the administration has also moved quickly in other areas of the criminal justice landscape.

Nowhere has that been more apparent than at the Justice Department, where under President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the department has seen one of its most tumultuous periods in modern history. Earlier this week, legal analyst Chris Geidner called the “destruction” of the department over the past year “hard to overstate.” Over 6,400 employees (out of about 108,000) have left, with hundreds presumably fired for having worked on investigations that Trump considered illegitimate, including probes into the rioters at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and inquiries into criminal conduct by Trump during his first term.

The exodus has hit divisions across the Justice Department, including career national security and counterterrorism prosecutors, as well as the section that handles sensitive public corruption cases. But the brain drain has been especially pronounced at the Civil Rights Division. As of August 2025, about three-quarters of the lawyers there had either resigned or been fired, according to Bloomberg News. Many left as the department turned against its historical task of addressing discrimination against marginalized groups, and instead, urged its lawyers to pursue cases against what Bondi described as illegal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion mandates.

Not only has the division abandoned much of its traditional remit, like investigating local police departments for civil rights abuses, it has also taken on new, unfamiliar work, like a Second Amendment unit focused on “expanding gun rights.”

In response to criticism of this new direction, a Justice Department spokesperson said that Bondi and Civil Rights division chief Harmeet Dhillon have helped restore the division to its “original mission” of protecting the rights of all Americans. It’s worth noting that Congress created the division as part of the 1957 Civil Rights Act, aimed at fighting racist Jim Crow segregation and disenfranchisement.

The first year of the administration has also been characterized by retreat from the Justice Department’s historic pledge of independence from the White House. Bondi issued a “zealous advocacy” memo nearly a year ago, declaring in essence that the department lawyers are, in fact, Trump’s lawyers. Since then, many of the department’s most visible moves have been in service to Trump’s political conflicts as much as to traditional enforcement priorities. A growing list of the president’s antagonists, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have found themselves under investigation or indictment. In several of those cases, courts have thrown out charges or issued sharp rebukes of DOJ behavior.

At least one federal judge has also taken aim at the department's decision to cut more than half a billion dollars in Office of Justice Programs grants. The money had been allocated to local governments, law enforcement agencies and nonprofits for everything from police training and equipment, to services for crime victims, community violence interruption programs and justice research. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta called the cuts ‘shameful,’ even as he ruled challengers were in the wrong court to try to stop it.

The Justice Department defended the cuts by arguing the awards no longer fit department priorities, alongside broader cost-cutting efforts.

My colleagues Sophia Nabours and Geoff Hing found that the cancellations created immediate disruptions for recipients who had to pause or scale back work, leave positions open, or lay off staff. In Shreveport, Louisiana, a victim-support nonprofit called Moms on a Mission, which works to support victims of gun violence, described having to pull back on trauma counseling and grief support groups after the cuts.

Similarly, Daphne Duret and I found how the cuts affected a program in rural Alabama that paired sheriff’s deputies with mental health professionals when responding to certain calls. The cuts led to staff departures, and forced officers back to handling mental health calls alone.

The effects of funding cuts for research go beyond what happens at an individual department or agency. The Brennan Center, a liberal-leaning criminal-justice think tank, noted that ending research “make[s] it harder for policymakers of all political stripes to fix shared problems.”

Some also worry that the cuts may imperil some of the dramatic decreases in crime rates the country has seen over recent years. In places like Baltimore, local officials have directly tied improved crime rates to nonprofit work that was cut after DOJ grants were eliminated.

Then there is clemency, the most direct presidential tool in the criminal justice system. Trump began his second term with an unprecedented mass pardon covering roughly 1,500 people charged or convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since then, the White House has continued to use clemency power in ways that depart from the Justice Department’s traditional review process — a shift underscored by the administration’s dismissal of pardon attorney Liz Oyer, after she declined to fast-track a pardon for actor Mel Gibson, a personal friend of the president. Oyer has since written that Trump is making a “mockery” of the clemency process.

The White House has generally defended its pardons because recipients were “overprosecuted by a weaponized DOJ” under then-President Joe Biden.

The result has led to an informal process that allows wealthy and politically connected people to skip the line, reported The Wall Street Journal. The president’s clemency docket now has a striking appearance of quid pro quo patronage. In several high-profile cases, Trump has granted pardons immediately after the recipient (or their close relatives) poured money into Trump-aligned political committees. In one characteristic example, Trump pardoned former nursing home executive Paul Walczak of tax crimes just weeks after Walczak’s mother attended a $1 million-per-seat fundraiser at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Because Trump’s clemency efforts have been focused on wealthy people convicted of white-collar crimes, he has also erased a historic amount of restitution owed to crime victims and fines owed to the U.S. government. This week, NBC News reported that Trump’s year-one pardons wiped out nearly $300 million owed by people convicted of crimes. By comparison, over the 12 years of the Obama and Biden administrations, just over $3 million in restitution and fines were eliminated.

But while Trump has used clemency aggressively for a select set of well-connected recipients, the broader thrust of the administration’s criminal justice agenda has been toward harsher — and in some cases — more violent punishment.

The Trump Justice Department signaled early in his second term that it would lean back into the federal death penalty, after authoring an execution spree late in his first term. In between the two Trump presidencies, Biden commuted nearly all federal death sentences, leaving Trump without a long list of prisoners awaiting execution. In response, the administration is now pushing several states to file charges against those same people, which could lead to executions under the authority of state laws instead.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/iTWJ-RQMlxHa_VAzhERxIvS34pATQvOIYXMieZLKYZg/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC8zNHpiYTZhczhy/ODhuNzdud2hxZHlv/YW04MzBhLzI2MDEy/M19HRVRUWV9DQUVT/U0FZMDEyNF9zb2Np/YWwuanBn,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:19.286095

O’Hara said the man's only previous interaction with law enforcement -- as far as he knew -- was for traffic tickets.
Thousands of demonstrators who oppose the crackdown on immigration crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave.","Federal officers shot and killed a person in Minneapolis on Saturday as the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continues across the area, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS described the suspect as an illegal immigrant, while Minneapolis police said he was a 37-year-old white man who was a U.S. citizen.

DHS said the man was wanted on violent assault charges, adding that he was armed with a gun and two magazines.

The agency said the suspect approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun ahead of the deadly shooting.

""The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted,"" DHS wrote on X.

""Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,"" DHS added.

DHS said the suspect ""wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement."" The agency added that about 200 rioters arrived at the scene and began to obstruct and assault law enforcement.

""Crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement,"" DHS said. ""This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.""

At a news conference, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino identified the suspect as an ""illegal alien,"" who has a criminal history. He said the man's death was a result of ""an attack on law enforcement.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara later spoke at a separate news conference with Mayor Jacob Frey. O'Hara's information about the person who was killed conflicts with DHS's report.

“Based on the information that we have, which is very limited, this is a 37-year-old white male who is a U.S. citizen,"" O'Hara told reporters.

O’Hara said the man's only previous interaction with law enforcement -- as far as he knew -- was for traffic tickets.

""And we believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry,” he said.

Gov. Tim Walz criticized DHS for sharing the information, as well as a photo of a gun, on social media. He said the information was unrelated to the deadly shooting.

""It's nonsense, people,"" he said. ""It's nonsense and it's lies.""

The City of Minneapolis said it is aware of reports of another shooting involving federal law enforcement, adding that the city is working to confirm more details.

""We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,"" the city wrote on X.

Frey addressed President Donald Trump directly during the news conference, telling the president to ""act like a leader.""

""How many times must local and national leaders plead with you, Donald Trump, that this is not creating safety in our city?"" Frey said. “What exactly are you accomplishing? If the goal was to achieve peace and safety, this is doing the opposite.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar expressed outrage at the shooting of a man during an immigration operation.

“Donald Trump and all your lieutenants who ordered this ICE surge: watch the horrific video of the killing today. The world is watching. Thousands of citizens stopped and harassed. Local police no longer able to do their work. Kids hiding. Schools closed. Get ICE out of Minnesota,” Klobuchar said on X.

Walz said he has been in contact with the White House following the shooting.

""I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning,"" Walz, who is a Democrat, wrote on X.

""Minnesota has had it,"" he added. ""This is sickening.""

Walz also also demanded that Trump end the the ongoing operation in Minnesota.

""Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now,"" he wrote.

Trump addressed the deadly shooting on Truth Social. He also shared the same photo DHS posted on X.

""This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off?"" Trump wrote, in part.

""LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB! 12,000 Illegal Alien Criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota. If they were still there, you would see something far worse than you are witnessing today!"" he added.

The details surrounding what led up to the shooting weren’t immediately clear.

Thousands of demonstrators who oppose the crackdown on immigration crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave.

Protesters started gathering in the Twin Cities since January 7 after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.

The agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, fired his gun after Good allegedly tried to ram him and other officers with her SUV. Ross reportedly suffered internal bleeding when he was hit by her vehicle.

Images circulated on social media Friday of work trucks being stopped by ICE agents, including one such stop at 22nd and Swan Friday morning, though it's not clear if ICE made arrests at the time.
Around 6:40 a.m., ICE agents approached the employee and asked him for identification.
She also would not comment on whether there are, or will soon be, more ICE agents operating in Tucson or Phoenix.
Responding to Friday's ICE activity, Tucson Mayor Regina Romero urged Tucsonans to remain peaceful if they protest immigration-enforcement activity.","Immigration agents in Tucson made multiple arrests Friday in operations spanning the city, from Barrio Santa Rosa to an east-side sushi restaurant, and even briefly questioned a city employee before noticing the logo on his truck, city officials said.

Three people from Venezuela — all with pending asylum cases, a relative said — were arrested after masked agents pulled over their vehicle in front of the Drachman Montessori Magnet School, on 22nd Street and South 10th Avenue, according to witnesses and Arizona Rep. Alma Hernandez, a Tucson Democrat.

Drachman Principal Jesús Celaya said agents, apparently with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arrested three of four people who were in the vehicle they'd pulled over in front of the school's playground around 11 a.m. Friday.

Dozens of children were on the playground at the time, he said. Celaya brought those children inside and decided to delay the planned physical-education class for kindergarten students until ICE left.

""I didn’t want children to witness it,"" he said, adding he was also concerned for students' safety.

""One of the ICE agents had a pepper spray can in his hands,"" he said. ""The fumes of that could definitely travel through the wind to children who are trying to go to school. ... The choice of the location didn’t seem logical or safe for the public, including just kids trying to go through their school day.""

A 29-year-old female passenger in the vehicle, who was not detained, said she was in the car with her husband, brother and sister-in-law. At first, agents only took her husband and brother into custody.

But then, ""my sister-in-law was asking the officer a lot of questions,"" she said, speaking in Spanish. ""And the officer felt offended, and he arrested her there, too.""

All have pending asylum cases, said the woman, who asked the Star to identify her by her second name, Patricia. The family has been checking in with ICE every three months and hasn't had any problems until now, she said.

Patricia, who arrived in the U.S. in October 2023 with her husband, said she pleaded with an ICE officer to let her family members go.

""I simply started crying and I said to him, 'Please, may God touch your heart, you are a human being. Please, I beg you. We are people, we are not criminals, we are honest people. Don't do this to us.' I spoke to him, I cried, but they didn't care, they simply took the three of them,"" she said. ""Why didn't they take me? I don't know — God's mercy.""

Hernandez, the state lawmaker, said arresting a family in front of an elementary school is ""reckless,"" particularly because the family has an active asylum case.

""They all had proper documentation to show they are legally here while their case is being processed,"" Hernandez said in a news release. ""ICE was made aware of this and still took them. This puts families, children, and entire neighborhoods like mine at risk, and demonstrates a blatant disregard for public safety.""

Images circulated on social media Friday of work trucks being stopped by ICE agents, including one such stop at 22nd and Swan Friday morning, though it's not clear if ICE made arrests at the time.

One city worker, a male employee in the Department of Transportation and Mobility, was questioned briefly by an agent at a convenience store on Irvington Road near Benson Highway on Friday morning, said City Manager Timothy Thomure in a written statement late Friday.

Around 6:40 a.m., ICE agents approached the employee and asked him for identification. As the man returned to his work vehicle, an agent noticed the City of Tucson logo and pointed it out to another agent. All three agents then turned and walked away, Thomure said.

Thomure said the incident is a worrisome indication that ICE isn't targeting ""the worst of the worst,"" but community members.

""It is deeply concerning that our employee seems to have been randomly selected for questioning and that the only thing that may have spared him"" was the logo on his vehicle, Thomure said. ""This encounter does not align with what federal immigration agencies have stated previously that their enforcement is driven by criminal warrants targeting the 'worst of the worst.' In fact, this encounter appears to be nothing more than the selection of a random member of our community who met an unstated profile established by the current federal administration.""

Multiple incidents this week

Friday's ICE operations seem to indicate an escalation, Pima County Attorney Laura Conover said.

""As has been widely reported, today apparently marked a significant change in circumstances with increased ICE activity throughout many of our neighborhoods across the County,"" she said in a written statement late Friday. ""Some of the activity observed today looked nothing like what we are familiar with from our local law enforcement. ... I will continue not to rush to judgment. But neither will I tolerate illegal conduct if proof of it comes to me.""

Conover encouraged members of the public to submit any photos or videos they believe show ""improper or illegal conduct"" to the County Attorney's Office website at pcao.pima.gov.

""I remind the community again to use your constitutional rights, to use your voice, to make yourself heard, to join and support each other in solidarity, and to protect one another. And I need you to do all of this peacefully and from a distance so each one of you goes home safe and sound each night.""

Also on Friday morning, apparent ICE officers detained an employee at Sakura restaurant, 6534 E. Tanque Verde Road. They arrested an employee before doors opened, which resulted in other employees not showing up for work and off-duty employees being called in, said chef Isaiah Gamez.

Video from the scene shows a group of masked agents wearing uniforms that said ""POLICE ICE"" taking one man.

""They took one of our group; the rest are at home,"" Gamez said.

ICE's media team said they would not have time Friday to respond to the Star's 12:30 p.m. query about how many people ICE arrested in Tucson on Friday, and whether they were ""targeted"" arrests of people known to ICE.

""There are about a dozen or so ahead of your queries so your deadline will not be met,"" ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe said in a 1 p.m. email.

In the email, Pitts O'Keefe said she could not share any information about people ICE arrests unless the Star provides the person's name and ""alien number,"" a unique identification number assigned by the Department of Homeland Security.

She also would not comment on whether there are, or will soon be, more ICE agents operating in Tucson or Phoenix.

""For OP Sec (operational security) reasons, we don’t give out the number of officers and agents in field,"" she said in the Friday email.

ICE breaks truck window

Also, on Sunday, Jan. 18, on Tucson's south side, ICE agents broke a driver's side truck window while questioning the man inside, before taking him into custody, according to video of the incident shared with the Star.

Steven Davis, the Rapid Response Network volunteer who shot the video, said he watched an ICE agent first use a device to break the driver's-side window before breaking the rest of it using his elbow and fist.

Another officer on the passenger side of the vehicle then opened the passenger side door and reached across to open the driver's-side door for the other agent, who took the man into custody, the video shows.

ICE did not respond to the Star's queries about why the man was detained and why agents had to break his window.

Davis said he noticed ICE following the man from the El Super grocery store to a gas station across the street, so Davis followed the ICE agents to act as a witness.

After the man's arrest, Davis said he noticed the man had work tools in the back of his truck, bags of groceries in the front seat of the car and a half-eaten croissant on the armrest.

Observing ICE activity is emotionally painful, but necessary, Davis said.

""It's difficult to watch,"" he said. ""Our job is to be there for our neighbors and whatever this is for me, it's so much worse for the ones who are detained and the family and friends they leave behind.""

Local advocates worry the flurry of activity indicates a real surge in ICE activity in Tucson, even as the number of unverified or false reports has also increased in recent weeks.

Responding to Friday's ICE activity, Tucson Mayor Regina Romero urged Tucsonans to remain peaceful if they protest immigration-enforcement activity.

""You have the right to protest and document these activities. It's very important to remain peaceful while you do so,"" Romero said in an Instagram post. ""The Trump administration wants to create fear and chaos in our community. Please stay safe and do not physically engage with federal agents or damage property.""

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes is also encouraging observers to document federal agents' activities through photo and video, in response to the fatal shooting of Minneapolis mom Renee Good on Jan. 7 by an ICE agent. Mayes has created a website for members of the public to report ""potential unlawful activity by federal agents or personnel,"" including immigration agents.

Patricia, whose Venezuelan family members were arrested Friday, said her family doesn't have an attorney, nor money for one. She's deeply anxious over what she's read about how the U.S. government treats ""Latinos.""

""It's something that has me worried,"" she said. ""I thought that here in the United States I was going to have a better life, a more peaceful life, and it turns out that now I live in agony with the government here.""

And when the architects of mass deportation are themselves motivated by racial contempt for their targets, then — as my friend Adam Serwer once wrote — the cruelty will inevitably be the point.
What I Wrote I wrote about the madness on display in President Trump’s letter to the president of Norway.","The public face of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a brutal, paramilitary force of masked men who hunt immigrants and terrorize American cities on behalf of the president of the United States.

The not-so-public face is somehow even worse.

ICE operates detention facilities across the country, holding tens of thousands of people arrested on immigration charges. President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill included $45 billion for the construction of new detention space, including facilities with tent-like structures meant to house a growing influx of people seized by ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents.

These facilities, human rights researchers and former detainees report, are cramped, squalid and dangerous. “The food they gave us was not edible,” according to one woman initially detained at a Chicago airport along with her 5-year-old daughter. “We didn’t eat anything for days. They didn’t even give us water to drink.” Eventually, the woman and her daughter were transferred to the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Dilley, Texas, which the woman “described as a living hell.”

“Sometimes my daughter doesn’t want to leave our room because she is so sad and just wants to leave this prison so badly. She cries and cries about all of this. I am so worried that I barely eat,” the woman said.

After conducting two oversight visits to Camp East Montana — an ICE detention facility on the grounds of Fort Bliss in El Paso, which served as an internment camp during World War II — Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas warned of “dangerous and inhumane” conditions in a letter to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem:

It is increasingly clear that it is not a safe nor professionally managed facility. Continuing to detain people at Camp East Montana means continually exposing people to risks from bad water, unhygienic conditions, poorly built facilities and a general lack of security and reliable management.

A separate letter to Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, sent by the American Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups, described hellish abuse at the facility: “Detained immigrants are held for weeks at a time with no access to the outdoors in cramped, squalid soft-sided tents with 72 people per unit, where toilets and showers flood eating areas with raw sewage.” Detainees allege that they were threatened, beaten or sexually abused as punishment for conduct ranging from simple requests for basic necessities to refusing to sign deportation orders. Based on interviews with more than 45 detained immigrants, the groups wrote that “Officers have beaten detainees and used threats of violence, criminal charges and imprisonment in attempts to coerce people held at Fort Bliss to leave the United States and cross the border into Mexico, even if they are not subject to a removal order to Mexico.”

One Cuban man detained at Fort Bliss reported that officers crushed his testicles with their fingers, slammed him against a wall and beat him such that he couldn’t touch the left side of his head without pain for about a month, all because he wouldn’t accept deportation to Mexico.

Officers at the same facility beat one detainee, a teenager, so badly that he “sustained injuries across his body, lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital in an ambulance.” His offense? He had switched off the overhead light in a housing unit.

At least 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the agency’s deadliest year since 2004. In just the first ten days of 2026, four people died in ICE custody. One of these deaths — of a Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at Camp East Montana — was ruled a homicide.

It is worth remembering that immigration enforcement is a civil procedure and that most people detained by ICE do not have criminal records. In the main, these are not violent people threatening the safety and integrity of the nation; they are ordinary men, women and children who have been caught in an authoritarian dragnet. Their treatment is less a necessary part of immigration detention than it is a punishment — deliberate pain inflicted on migrants in order to force them out of the country, whether or not they have a legal right to be here. (And it should go without saying that people found guilty of criminal offenses have an absolute right to fair and humane treatment.)

Back in 2024, I argued that Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportation was an atrocity in the making.

Imagine the conditions that might prevail for hundreds of thousands of people crammed into hastily constructed camps, the targets of a vicious campaign of demonization meant to build support for their detention and deportation. If undocumented immigrants really are, as Trump says, “poisoning the blood of our country,” then how do we respond? What do we do about poison? Well, we neutralize it.

I also noted that any mass deportation effort would involve a “mass campaign of racial and ethnic profiling” that would almost certainly stoke “strife and pervasive civil conflict.”

There is an idea, among those sympathetic to the president’s efforts to reduce illegal immigration, that you could have a more humane program of mass deportation and accomplish the overall goal of increased removals without a surfeit of brutality. This is a fantasy. Mass removal is itself inhumane. There is no way to accomplish it without subjecting countless people to the treatment we are seeing now in the streets and in the jails. And when the architects of mass deportation are themselves motivated by racial contempt for their targets, then — as my friend Adam Serwer once wrote — the cruelty will inevitably be the point.

What I Wrote

I wrote about the madness on display in President Trump’s letter to the president of Norway.

There is no need to go on about the lunacy of this letter. Not even the president’s most eager apologists could spin this as anything other than what it is: a disgrace. The letter is an astonishing glimpse into the mind of a man who rejects the core duty of his office, faithful representation of the American people. The only thing he cares about — the only thing that motivates him — is the immediate satisfaction of his every impulse.

I also joined my colleagues Kathleen Kingsbury and Ross Douthat in Los Angeles to discuss the first year of the Trump administration.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/Newsletter-6973f026-qcgm/Newsletter-6973f026-qcgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:58:16.513042

The White House has pressured immigration officials to fulfill the president’s goal, an effort that requires targeting immigrants well beyond violent criminals.

But Americans broadly do not support such a sweeping approach. In the poll, 38 percent of Americans said the federal government should prioritize deporting immigrants who have committed serious crimes, while 21 percent said the administration should only deport serious criminals.

“ICE should focus on the bad hombres. The bad hombres, that’s it, not the cleaning ladies,” said Rep. Maria Salazar (R-Fla.). “One thing is the gardeners, another thing is the gangsters. One thing is the cooks, the other thing is the coyotes.”

The White House, so far, has maintained its heavy enforcement presence in Minneapolis, betting that the issue is messaging, not its policies. The president said this week that his administration needs to do more to highlight the criminals they’ve arrested during the Minnesota crackdown.

A person close to the White House, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Republicans have to keep the focus on criminal arrests, public safety and the Trump administration’s success in securing the southern border, which are more popular with voters across the board. Otherwise, the person worried, the GOP is losing support with moderate Republicans, independents, Latinos and young voters.

“Do I think we have to be a little bit smarter about it? I don’t think there’s any question about it,” the person said of the party’s messaging. “The reason why crime is down across the country, especially in these Democratic states and these blue cities, is because of one thing — the only thing that changed is President Trump’s policies.”

Most Trump voters do support his mass deportations campaign, with 55 percent saying the actions, including his widespread deployment of ICE agents across the U.S. are “about right,” the POLITICO Poll with Public First finds. But there is a notable split between Trump’s strongest 2024 voters and those who are more malleable: Among the 2024 Trump voters who do not identify as MAGA, a more moderate group of Trump supporters, 29 percent say his campaign is too aggressive. Seventeen percent of these voters say it is not aggressive enough.

And a 43 percent plurality of non-MAGA Trump voters say they support the goals of Trump’s deportation agenda but not how he is implementing it, compared to 28 percent of MAGA Trump voters — his strongest supporters — who say the same.

The poll results suggest Americans are uneasy with the Trump administration’s approach, and that even many Trump voters who support increased immigration enforcement oppose the president’s sprawling deportation campaign.

“They are going to be worried about, OK, is ICE using excessive force? Are they going after, you know, moms and dads that have a clean record?” said Brendan Steinhauser, a GOP strategist in Texas. “I don’t think that plays well with independents and moderates. I don’t think it plays well with center-right Republicans. It does seem to play well with a smaller subset of the Republican Party. But I don’t think that’s where, nationally, the people who swing elections are on this.”

Some battleground Republicans, worried immigration enforcement could become a political albatross in an already tough election year, are trying to walk a tightrope of showing support for ICE in general while also calling for restraint in their actions.

“ICE exists to carry out laws passed by Congress, and in that sense, its role is absolutely necessary, but at the same time, enforcement must be professional and targeted and humane,” said Republican candidate Trinh Ha, a Vietnamese immigrant running in Washington’s eighth district, a seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier. “What’s happening right now underscores why enforcement must always be paired with restraint and accountability.”

A White House spokesperson said the president’s mass deportations agenda was a central campaign promise and argued that the administration’s enforcement — and its message — has and will continue to focus on the “worst of the worst,” including people with convictions for assault, rape and murder. The official said the administration won’t allow criminals to remain free in cities where “Democrats don’t cooperate with us,” adding that there “wouldn’t be a need for as much of an ICE presence if we had cooperation.”

The president has expressed concerns about how ICE is being perceived. He posted Tuesday on Truth Social that the Department of Homeland Security and ICE needed to do more to highlight the “murderers and other criminals” they’re detaining, arguing that it would help boost Americans’ support of ICE. He then took to the podium during a White House press briefing and spent the first 10 minutes sifting through photos of immigrants who had committed crimes.

“Because Minnesota is so much in the fray, and I say to my people all the time — and they’re so busy doing other things — ‘they don’t say it like they should,’” Trump said. “They are apprehending murderers and drug dealers, a lot of bad people. … I say why don’t you talk about that? Because people don’t know.”

Vice President JD Vance traveled to Minneapolis on Thursday, where he said he wanted to “lower the temperature.” Flanked by immigration agents, Vance empathized with community members’ concerns, while blaming state and local officials’ lack of cooperation and far-left agitators for fueling chaos in the city.

“We want to be able to enforce the immigration laws on the one hand, while on the other hand, we want to make sure the people in Minneapolis are able to go about their day,” he said.

It remains to be seen whether the administration’s message will be enough to tame the concerns coursing through the party. While many Republicans remain confident that they are still most trusted on immigration and border security — and that Democrats will ultimately be seen as too extreme in their response — others warn that Trump’s base won’t be the voters who swing races in 2026.

Immigration still ranks far below economic concerns for voters, according to The POLITICO Poll. When asked to select the top three issues facing the country, just 21 percent cited illegal immigration, compared with half who said the cost of living. But as the White House continues to make immigration a policy priority, crucial swaths of swing voters and soft Trump supporters are expressing discomfort with some of the administration’s tactics.

“I’d reframe the ‘raids’ narrative,” said Buzz Jacobs, a Republican strategist and White House immigration policy director for former President George W. Bush. “The reality is that most enforcement activity is routine and never becomes a headline.”

Reyes, opinion contributor",,,,,https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/5703262-denaturalization-legal-ethical-issues/,"This year, the Trump administration is looking to strip more foreign-born Americans of their U.S. citizenship.
Citizenship and Immigration Services are being asked to provide between 100 and 200 denaturalization cases a month.
So the administration will face high legal hurdles as it seeks to ramp up denaturalization cases.
Logistically, increasing the number of denaturalization cases will result in a waste of government resources.
Instead of poring over past citizenship decisions, USCIS would be better off dealing with its record backlog of 11.3 million pending immigration cases.","This year, the Trump administration is looking to strip more foreign-born Americans of their U.S. citizenship. Under new guidance for 2026, field offices for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services are being asked to provide between 100 and 200 denaturalization cases a month. “We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice,” a USCIS spokesperson said, “to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”

Since President Trump’s first term, he has embraced denaturalization as part of his crackdown on immigration. However, this latest move is misguided and unwise. Stripping away citizenship from foreign-born Americans raises serious legal, practical and ethical concerns.

To be clear, “denaturalization” is the revocation of citizenship of a naturalized immigrant by the government. It potentially applies to the roughly 26 million people in the U.S. who were born abroad and have gone through the process of becoming Americans.

Under existing law, the grounds for stripping a person of their citizenship are narrow. A person can be denaturalized if it is found that they concealed disqualifying facts in their application, or if they obtained citizenship illegally. It’s a long and complicated procedure, which is one reason why it’s rare. Between 2017 and 2025, the Justice Department filed just over 120 such cases.

Now the administration wants to examine several hundred cases a month, which would amount to the largest increase of denaturalization efforts in modern U.S. history.

This expansion of denaturalization efforts runs counter to Supreme Court precedent. In 1943, the high court emphasized that citizenship should not be taken away lightly, noting, “We believe the facts and the law should be construed as far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen.” In case after case, the court has rejected attempts by the government to revoke citizenship as inconsistent with First and 14th amendment protections. In 2017, the court found that, in cases based on alleged fraud, the government must prove that any misrepresentation directly affected the citizenship process. So the administration will face high legal hurdles as it seeks to ramp up denaturalization cases.

Logistically, increasing the number of denaturalization cases will result in a waste of government resources. Each case requires an investigation, a civil or criminal proceeding, and then a judicial order. This takes time, money and manpower. Instead of poring over past citizenship decisions, USCIS would be better off dealing with its record backlog of 11.3 million pending immigration cases.

On a broader level, going after people who have already followed the process for obtaining citizenship sends a disturbing message. It will signal to naturalized citizens that they are second-class Americans, subject to investigation by the government at any time. It will contribute to confusion and anxiety in immigrant communities and erode public confidence in the value of American citizenship itself.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said in December that “Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization.” She’s not wrong. Nor is denaturalization new — it is a longstanding procedure used by administrations of both parties.

Yet the danger of setting denaturalization targets or goals is that cases will be brought to meet arbitrary quotas, rather than on their own merits. This opens the door to denaturalization being used improperly as a political weapon or as an immigration enforcement mechanism. The administration can do a great deal of harm to naturalized citizens merely by launching a case against them. This should alarm all Americans, including those conservatives who say they are against intrusive big government.

Congress should not be afraid to demand oversight and compliance with the law, especially given Trump’s sagging poll numbers. In December, an AP poll found that only 38 percent of Americans approved of his handling of immigration. Targeting U.S. citizens seems like a long way from the president’s campaign pledges to go after criminal undocumented immigrants, the people that McLaughlin has called the “worst of the worst.” This expansion of denaturalization efforts cannot go unchecked.

Prioritizing denaturalization is divisive and does not make our country stronger or safer. It is an action that should be reserved for egregious cases, like war criminals and terrorists — not ordinary Americans.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/GettyImages-2233441251.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-24 11:58:42.514873

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.","Minneapolis — The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America’s divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an “abject lie.” It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family’s attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

School officials say ICE used the boy as ‘bait’

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,” she said.

The father told the child’s mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn’t leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

“Why detain a 5-year-old?” the superintendent asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

Other adults at the scene wanted to care for the boy

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

ICE denies what school officials and neighbors said

“ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as ‘bait,’” said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ”

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.”

The officers, she said, “abided by the father’s wishes to keep the child with him.""

Bovino and ICE officials criticize media coverage

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the “false media narrative” about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and “did everything they could to reunite him with his family.”

“Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

Where are the father and son now?

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children’s Rights, who visited the facility last week.

“The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,” Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

“I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,” Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers “get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.”

The family’s lawyer was unable to reach them

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,” he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch’s office said he was unavailable to comment.

What is the Trump administration's policy on detaining children?

The child’s immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn’t, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

“This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,” Homan said last year on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

The Trump administration last July issued a “Detained Parents Directive” that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE “should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.” The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

“If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child’s immigration status,” said Neha Desai, managing director at Children’s Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. “When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child’s care.”

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport 1 million people a year.
GEO Group resumed admitting immigrants at its 1,940-bed Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California after a COVID ban was lifted.

Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected.

Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system — and privately run holding facilities — expected to grow even larger.

“Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up,” he told The Marshall Project.

On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department — though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Contractors like GEO Group and its primary competitor, CoreCivic, welcomed the news. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes.

At the beginning of 2025, the companies had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group, based near Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s home in Florida, seemed particularly well-suited.

“This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments — in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring — to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” George Zoley, the Greek-born founder of GEO Group, said during a quarterly earnings call in February.

By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement.

Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America.

“Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst.

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport 1 million people a year. In December, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, claimed it had deported 605,000 people since Trump was elected and that an additional 1.9 million people self-deported. The department dangled financial carrots like a “free flight home for Christmas and $1,000.”

Immigrant arrests climbed. In December, ICE detained 68,000 people nationwide, up from about 40,000 at the beginning of the year. That’s more than ever before on record, yet only a quarter of those people had been convicted of a crime, including low-level offenses. Another 25% had criminal cases pending.

Detention capacity is still far from ICE’s stated goal of having access to more than 100,000 beds at a time to detain immigrants.

Early last year, GEO Group said it expected to provide 32,000 beds for ICE, more than double the amount at the end of the Biden administration. In doing so, the firm told investors that it was likely that all of its idle prisons would be activated by the end of the year.

GEO Group resumed admitting immigrants at its 1,940-bed Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California after a COVID ban was lifted. On the East Coast, in Newark, New Jersey, GEO Group’s 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility opened with the help of an ICE contract valued at $1 billion. In the Midwest, North Lake Processing Center, a notorious 1,800-bed facility in Baldwin, Michigan, also opened.

As of Dec. 15, GEO Group had idle facilities with nearly 4,700 empty beds in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas, according to its report to investors.

CoreCivic also ramped up, but not as quickly as investors expected. Notably, in March, the Tennessee-based firm said it resumed “operations and care” for up to 2,400 people, including families, at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in South Texas, a contract expected to generate $180 million in annual revenue.

“Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger, a former correctional officer himself, said during an earnings call in May.

At the end of September, CoreCivic reported that it had idle facilities with more than 7,000 empty beds.

Adding pressure to stock prices, the federal government apprehended fewer people at the U.S. southern border, lowering the number of new arrivals to detain or monitor. Still, in December, GEO Group touted that the “alien population” in the United States holds strong at 16.8 million, citing a figure from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit seeking to reduce immigration. GEO Group also said that 182,000 people were being monitored in the community for ICE’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (down from about 370,000 under the Biden administration).

Zoley said GEO Group subsidiary BI Incorporated could scale up its monitoring contract to serve millions of people for ICE.

The Trump administration is also still ramping up. And investors and observers expect the system to keep growing this year.

“As they expand their infrastructure — that includes officers, buildings, fleets, buses, planes, technology — then that’s when we are probably going to see more people, more numbers captured into all of this,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a national human rights nonprofit that monitors the prison industry.

The Department of Homeland Security recently signed a $140 million contract to buy planes from Boeing for deportations. Thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents are being recruited, with others offered $50,000 signing bonuses to come out of retirement. More local police and sheriff departments have formal agreements to support national immigration enforcement efforts.

The White House and ICE see publicly traded private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic as “allies and assets” to their ongoing efforts to deport many more people, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“The contractors are the consequence of the policy choice made by this administration,” he said.

And as a libertarian, he said he views illegal immigration as the consequence of a broken immigration system. He described the Trump administration’s immigration policy as “indiscriminate mass deportation.”

“If you go down the list, it’s hard to find a right that they haven’t violated in the Constitution,” he said. “I find it incredibly troubling that they are getting away with it so far.”

He said trying to open 100,000 ICE detention beds nationwide is an “absurd goal” that has required the government to arrest people for a far broader set of reasons than previous administrations have used.

“There aren’t enough criminal immigrants in the United States that they can catch to fill those facilities, so this is all about caging a bunch of peaceful people who aren’t bothering anyone,” Bier said.

He expects the Trump administration to surpass its detention bed goal.

“They could easily be at 200,000 by the end of this term,” he said. “The main limitation would just be the personnel to man that. You have to find actual people willing to do this work. But in terms of just paying for it, they got way more money than they could possibly spend on this.”

Gomes, the analyst, said that as ICE brings more people into work, it could improve the financial results of GEO Group and CoreCivic.

It will determine whether the Trump administration can end birthright citizenship for hundreds of thousands of babies born on U.S. soil each year.

The case, Barbara v. Trump, challenges President Trump’s executive order denying citizenship to children born in the United States if neither parent is a citizen or lawful permanent resident. While every court that has reviewed the policy has blocked it as unconstitutional, its legal journey has been fraught, involving a fight over nationwide injunctions, litigation pivots, and fundamental questions about the 14th Amendment.

If the administration prevails, it would do more than determine who gets citizenship going forward. It would overturn 125 years of settled precedent and fundamentally reinterpret what it means to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States under the 14th Amendment.

Trump’s order

On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order declaring that children born in the United States do not automatically receive citizenship if their parents lack a sufficient connection to the country. The order specifically denies citizenship documents to babies born after February 19, 2025, in two scenarios:

First, if the mother is unlawfully present in the United States and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

Second, if the mother’s presence is lawful but temporary — for example, on a tourist visa, student visa, temporary work visa, or any other nonimmigrant status — and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

That second category affects the potential children of roughly 3 million people legally present in the United States. A baby born to two H-1B workers from India, or to a graduate student from China, would not receive U.S. citizenship under this policy.

Such babies would be denied Social Security numbers, passports, and other citizenship documentation. They could become stateless if their parents’ home countries don’t grant citizenship by descent.

Why it’s been blocked

So far, the policy has been blocked at every turn. Multiple federal district courts issued preliminary injunctions, concluding that the executive order directly contradicts the 14th Amendment, which states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”

The phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is key. The Trump administration argues it means something like “complete political allegiance” or “not subject to any foreign power.” Under that interpretation, children of non-citizens wouldn’t qualify because their parents owe allegiance elsewhere.

Challengers argue this interpretation is historically wrong and functionally unworkable. The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 to overturn the Dred Scott decision and ensure that formerly enslaved people were citizens. The debates at the time make clear that “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to exclude only people who have immunity from U.S. law.

But courts have consistently rejected the argument that illegal immigrants are also excluded, pointing to the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. That case involved a man born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrant parents who could not become U.S. citizens under the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Supreme Court held that he was a U.S. citizen anyway because he was born on U.S. soil. The court interpreted “subject to the jurisdiction” to mean everyone except children of foreign diplomats with immunity and children of foreign soldiers during a hostile occupation — both groups that are not subject to U.S. law.

Barring those two exceptions, it has been understood for more than a century that every person born in the United States, regardless of their parents’ citizenship or immigration status, is a U.S. citizen. Now, conservative justices who claim to follow originalist methodology will have to decide whether to claim to believe the original public meaning of the 14th Amendment supports Trump’s position, or whether 125 years of settled practice should continue.

The procedural journey

When Trump’s executive order was first challenged in January 2025, multiple district courts across the country issued nationwide injunctions blocking the policy from being enforced anywhere. This is a common pattern in immigration litigation, in which plaintiffs file in friendly jurisdictions, judges issue sweeping injunctions, and the policy is blocked everywhere while appeals work their way through the courts.

But in June 2025, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in Trump v. CASA that significantly limited the power of district courts to issue nationwide injunctions. The court held that preliminary injunctions should generally be limited to providing relief only to the plaintiffs in the case, not to everyone in the country. The administration claimed this as a major victory and declared that the nationwide blocks on its birthright citizenship order were now invalid.

What happened next turned the outcome on its head. The A.C.L.U., which represented plaintiffs in one of the cases, pivoted to a class action strategy. Rather than seeking a nationwide injunction to protect everyone, the organization sought class certification to represent all babies affected by the policy. In a savvy bit of litigation strategy, they argued that if they couldn’t get a nationwide injunction, they should be able to represent a nationwide class.

A federal judge agreed and certified a nationwide class of all babies born in the United States after February 19, 2025, who would be denied citizenship under Trump’s executive order. With the class certified, the judge then issued a preliminary injunction protecting everyone affected by the policy.

The practical effect was essentially the same as a nationwide injunction, reached through a different procedural route.

So the administration’s win in the nationwide injunction case turned out to be something of a hollow victory. The policy is still blocked, and now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case on the merits.

What happens if Trump wins

If the Supreme Court sides with the Trump administration, accepting the administration’s interpretation of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” it would mean the 14th Amendment never guaranteed birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens in the first place. The practical implications would force a fundamental shift in how American society runs.

Hundreds of thousands of babies born in the United States each year would be denied citizenship. The Migration Policy Institute projects that an average of about 255,000 U.S.-born children would not have U.S. citizenship each year due to their parents’ immigration status.

Many of these children could become stateless. Not all countries grant birthright citizenship, and if neither the United States (based on birthplace) nor the parents’ home country (based on descent) recognizes the child as a citizen, the child would have no citizenship at all.

Implementation would be a nightmare. Who would be responsible for determining whether a newborn’s parents have the right immigration status? Would hospitals need to verify parents’ legal status before issuing birth certificates? Would state vital-records offices be required to collect immigration documentation?

It would create two kinds of birth certificates. Some birth certificates would prove citizenship, and others wouldn’t. This would introduce uncertainty and potential discrimination into all sorts of contexts where proof of citizenship is required.

It would change the relationship between the federal government and the states on citizenship questions. Currently, states issue birth certificates, and if you are born in a state, you are a U.S. citizen. Under the new administration, the federal government would decide who gets citizenship based on parental immigration status, potentially creating situations in which someone is recognized as a citizen in one state but not another.

Oral arguments are expected sometime this spring, with a decision likely by June or July 2026.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6UIk!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb59588ad-4f33-4d75-86cf-dd023a8b7457_7952x5304.jpeg",N,,2026-01-24 08:57:47.907057

The Trump administration's immigration crackdown and ICE surge in the Twin Cities drew large protests today.

Amna Nawaz:

It was part of a general strike and walkout backed by labor leaders and faith groups.

Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro begins our coverage with this report from Minneapolis.

Protesters:

ICE out! ICE out! ICE out!

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Thousands of people braved bone-chilling temperatures this afternoon for a rally in downtown Minneapolis, protesting what they call a siege of the Twin Cities by federal agents.

For many here and throughout the Twin Cities, Renee Nicole Good has become an icon. The 37-year-old mother of three was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis two weeks ago. Her image now appears widely throughout the Twin Cities.

Annie Rose co-owns the Lost Fox, a downtown St. Paul cafe that's a quiet refuge from all the tension outside.

Annie Rose, Co-Owner, Lost Fox:

Renee Good is the face of it. It's a face that people can feel comfortable with. She's a woman. She was a mother. She was white. And it's something that we can come back to and say, oh, they came from my neighbors and then they came from me. Well, that is something that we can all like resonate with.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Today, she closed the place, even though it's tough to lose a Friday evening's revenue in the slowest month of the year, she says.

Annie Rose:

It's already hard out here. Every January, I take out a no-interest credit card to make sure I can make payroll. This year, I'm going to probably have to pay interest on that credit card.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Across the metro area, hundreds of small businesses, especially restaurants, Heeded a call to observe a general strike, many in sympathy with immigrant-owned shops where business has plummeted sharply amid fears of ICE patrols.

Schools in the area also closed today. Labor unions led the call for the general strike, but the decision was made easier by today's life-threatening low temperatures.

Still, Annie Rose said she felt compelled to brace them.

Annie Rose:

It's all fear-based. You're afraid to go to rallies, whether it's cold. You're afraid to go to rallies because you don't want to be shot. You're afraid to stand up for things because of fear, and how can you live your life if you're constantly in fear? It's important to show my kids that, no, you can stand up for what you believe in.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Protesters marched about a mile through downtown Minneapolis to the indoor basketball arena. The DHS gave no signs today of easing up on its surge in the Twin Cities in the days ahead. On Thursday, Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino was asked if there's a number of arrests agents were targeting.

Greg Bovino, Border Patrol Commander:

There is a number, and it's called all of them.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said 10,000 -- quote -- ""criminal illegal aliens"" have been arrested here, a sharp spike from the start of the week, when the agency put the figure at 3,000. But the department has released details of far fewer cases, which it calls the worst of the worst.

All this comes at a time of rising public scrutiny. ICE officers detained a 5-year-old boy on Tuesday during an immigration enforcement operation. At a press conference today, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said the boy was being cared for.

Marcos Charles, ICE Associate Director:

We do everything in our power not to separate families. So they took him back together to Minneapolis, to the city, to the ICE facility for processing. And now they are being well cared for at a family residential center.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

On Thursday, three prominent civic activists were arrested after an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church. The White House later posted an A.I.-manipulated image of one woman to its social media account.

When asked about the image, Kaelan Dorr, the White House Deputy Communications Director, wrote: ""Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.""

At a separate anti-ICE rally today, roughly 100 people, including members of clergy, were arrested after protesting outside a terminal at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Annie Rose:

I am slowly losing hope, and that is a problem, and that's what keeps me up at night. But then I go to rallies. Like, you asked me. I'm going to go to the rally, and that is to see hope in process.

The massive demonstration in subzero temperatures was a central part of an economic shutdown that included strikes, arrests and civil disobedience, hundreds of businesses closing their doors, and rallies. The call for ​“no work, no school, no shopping” was put out publicly roughly 10 days ago by a coalition of unions, faith groups and community organizations.

“It was bigger than I was expecting, much bigger. I was kind of worried about the weather, but everybody showed up.""

The idea was to ​“suspend the normal order of business” as a way to protest the unprecedented federal deployment of thousands of masked, armed federal agents on Minnesota.

Organizers estimated the crowd was at least 50,000, with some guessing higher, around 100,000. The big turnout is stunning because it was -9 degrees when the march began, temperatures that can quickly cause frostbite to exposed skin.

“Oh my God, today is amazing, overwhelming, and very powerful,” said Feben Ghilagaber, an airport food service worker and steward for UNITE HERE Local 17. ​“It was bigger than I was expecting, much bigger. I was kind of worried about the weather, but everybody showed up.”

According to Ghilagaber, ​“a lot” of airport workers in her union didn’t go to work Friday in order to support the shutdown, with many of them calling in sick.

""I mean, ICE is just deplorable,"" he said. ""And I mean, anyone could get in the path of the ICE agents. It just infringes on our own civil rights.”

It is too early to assess how many workers withheld their labor as part of the day of action, which organizers refer to as a ​“Day of Truth and Freedom.” But workers and unions were central to the day’s events. A commercial electrician and member of IBEW Local 292 who was holding a sign reading ​“General Strike is a Path to Justice,” told me during the march that he was ​“out here to support immigrant rights, support every American.”

“I mean, ICE is just deplorable,” he said. ​“And I mean, anyone could get in the path of the ICE agents. It just infringes on our own civil rights.”

Another Minnesotan, who requested anonymity to protect her from retaliation by ICE, told me, ​“I’m here today to stand up for everyone, stand up for myself. I am impacted. I came here when I was two years old. My parents brought me here from Mexico. All I know is America, so seeing everything that’s going on, seeing my family ripped apart, seeing kids being snatched, an innocent woman shot for standing up for what’s right, it’s all surreal.”

“I’m speaking out for those who couldn’t be here today,” said the 29-year-old, ​“who are hiding, who every time the doorbell rings their heart stops.”

Earlier that morning, about 100 faith leaders blocked a key road outside of Terminal 1 departures at the Minneapolis – Saint Paul International Airport in an act of civil disobedience against ICE.

“I’m speaking out for those who couldn’t be here today,” said the 29-year-old, “who are hiding, who every time the doorbell rings their heart stops.”

With thousands of supporters behind them, they sang ​“before this campaign fails, we’ll all go down to jail — everybody has a right to live.” They held signs showing abducted members of UNITE HERE Local 17.

The crowd — including striking workers and union members, some of whom work at the airport — stayed outside in the subzero temperatures to cheer on the civil disobedience. Supporters passed around hand warmers and snacks to help sustain the crowd.

Katrina Zabriskie, 22, watched her mother, a Minnesota-based chaplain, get arrested. ​“It was really emotional,” she told me. ​“When the crowd started chanting, ​‘We love you,’ I started to cry. Mostly I’m just really proud.” Many of the faith leaders prayed in the moments before they were arrested by police.

Tens of thousands of protesters braved freezing temperatures in Minneapolis on Friday, January 23, 2026, to make their voices heard and demand ICE end its violence on their communities and leave the state. Sarah Lazare

“We care about the safety of our neighbors,” Zabriskie added. ​“We believe it is deeply unjust taking people from their homes and deporting them, brutalizing them, and keeping them in detention centers. It’s not something that should be happening.”

Those roughly 100 clergy, according to a news release from the ICE Out of MN coalition, were arrested for their part in ​“the statewide shutdown ICE Out of Minnesota: A Day of Truth & Freedom.” The clergy’s demands focused on Delta and Signature Aviation, which they said have been complicit in and have helped facilitate the deportations of Minnesotans.

Scenes outside of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport where nearly 100 clergy engaged in an act of civil disobedience to protest ICE on January 23, 2026. Sarah Lazare

The faith leaders want Delta and Signature Aviation to publicly call for ​“an immediate end to the ICE ​‘surge’ into MN and for ICE to leave the state.” They also urge the companies to ​“join Minnesotans” in demanding that the ICE agent who killed Renee Good be held ​“legally accountable,” and ​“call for Congress to stop funding ICE.”

Good, a poet and mother of three who lived in Minneapolis, was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on January 7. Public outrage over the murder energized organizers and residents throughout Minnesota and across the country, and was a rallying cry throughout the day.

The civil disobedience at the airport was significant because the site has become a flashpoint in the federal assault on Minnesota.

The coalition added that ""an estimated 2,000 people have been deported through MSP, and many people who work at MSP have been abducted by ICE while at work or commuting to and from the airport.”

“Delta relies on MSP as a major hub, and Signature Aviation provides logistical support for ICE operations,” the ICE Out of MN coalition said in a statement released after the arrests of clergy.

​“The MSP Airport serves tens of millions of travelers each year and is now used as the key site in DHS’s operations to abduct and rush out Minnesotans to detention centers,” the statement said. The coalition added that ​“an estimated 2,000 people have been deported through MSP, and many people who work at MSP have been abducted by ICE while at work or commuting to and from the airport.”

But while the airport is the site of abductions, it is also the site of struggle. Some of the protesters, workers and faith leaders outside the airport could be heard chanting ​“We are the workers, the mighty mighty workers!” A sign read, ​“We are under reacting,” and another person with a bullhorn loudly emphasized: ​“We are here to tell corporations to stop being complicit with ICE.”

Earlier on Friday morning at the airport, Nick Benson, an organizer with the grassroots and non-partisan group MN50501, told me ​“This airport is the narrow end of the funnel where our neighbors are getting shipped off to God knows where.”

The strike and actions across the state — as well as solidarity actions across the country — also come on the heels of harrowing news that a 5-year-old was taken by ICE agents from the driveway of his home in the Minneapolis area on Tuesday. The preschooler and his father are now reportedly being held in a detention center in Texas.

For weeks, federal agents have been stalking and abducting people at schools, daycares and from their homes — and unleashing violence on people trying to protect their neighbors. That violence has been extreme and deadly.

The broad coalition that came together to help organize Friday’s work stoppage also had specific demands that include ICE immediately leaving Minnesota and that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot and killed Good, be ​“held legally accountable.” They’re also calling for ICE not to receive any ​“additional federal funding … in the upcoming congressional budget, and ICE should be investigated for human and constitutional violations of Americans and our neighbors.”

For the throngs of those participating in the shutdown on Friday, the stakes were not academic. SEIU Local 26, which represents more than 8,000 of the state’s janitors, window cleaners and other property service workers, has ​“lost over 20 members to these abductions by federal agents, often without warning, often without due process,” said union president Greg Nammacher at a January 19 press conference.

The federal agents’ strategy, he added, is ​“to break up families, to disappear loved ones who for hours and days often don’t have any idea where their family members are and often have no access to legal counsel.”

But it’s not just immigrant workers who are harmed. Nammacher emphasized that ​“if the declared purpose is to help U.S.-born workers get higher wages, which is sometimes what we are told, it has had the opposite effect.”

A window cleaner who led a strike four years ago to win improved safety measures on the job was recently detained at a routine immigration check-in, Nammacher said. He had lived in the United States for 30 years, yet agents have already deported him to Mexico, away from his family.

“His sacrifice made all window cleaners in the Twin Cities safer, no matter where they were born, no matter what their citizenship status,” Nammacher said.

About 16 members of UNITE HERE Local 17 (which represents more than 6,000 hospitality workers in the Twin Cities metro area) have been abducted, and the Minneapolis – Saint Paul International Airport has become a site of repeated kidnappings of both union and non-union workers.

“Uber drivers are continuously harassed and snatched away, leaving abandoned cars behind, their families completely unaware of where they are,” Sheigh Freeberg, Local 17’s secretary-treasurer, said at a January 9 press conference inside Terminal 1. ​“UNITE HERE Local 17 members who work at the airport have been taken away behind TSA, and ICE flights have increased — sometimes twice daily.”

Since the call for a shutdown went out, the list of unions and community and faith-based organizations joining the effort grew substantially. In addition to SEIU Local 26 and UNITE HERE Local 17, the Minnesota Nurses Association, another heavy-hitting union, joined the effort.

Local and regional labor councils also joined and on January 20, the executive board of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 1,000 unions representing more than 300,000 Minnesota workers, voted to endorse Friday’s work stoppage.

The union mobilizations are not limited to urban metro areas. AFSCME Council 65 – Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, for example, represents workers in public services, nonprofits and health care across the state and issued a statement supporting the coalition, even if it fell short of calling for a work stoppage.

Building trades unions tend to skew more conservative, making it significant that IBEW Local 110 sent a statement to members reading, ​“These federal agents have shown up to schools, day cares and churches. They have dragged people from their cars, broken down doors and taken people from their workplaces.”

Solidarity actions took place across the country, from Massachusetts to New York to Chicago. Some labor and community leaders, organizers and supporters also traveled to Minnesota for the shutdown, including members of the group Rabbis for Ceasefire, who joined with clergy, and Chicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates.

“Every time this country has had a debate on the sustainability and expansion of our democracy, workers have settled that debate,"" Gates said, ""and I'm looking for workers to do the same thing this time.”

“I’m sick of wiping tears, I’m sick of hugging people, I’m sick of saying I’m sorry. Today, we saw people who are sick of doing the same thing,” Gates said in an interview. ​“I think it was glorious, and I think everyone is going to have to do that — and at the same time.”

“Every time this country has had a debate on the sustainability and expansion of our democracy, workers have settled that debate,” Gates said, ​“and I’m looking for workers to do the same thing this time.”

Gates also pointed to one key reason why Minneapolis was able to undertake such a shutdown: they’ve practiced.

“People here have been practicing going on strike and beating the boss. They’ve been practicing coalition work that helps them beat the boss, they’ve been maintaining their structures that they’ve had since George Floyd. These are things that have been in practice,” she said.

“People have to be in practice, in community, resisting and reimagining.”

Meanwhile, more than 700 Minnesota businesses pledged to close January 23 in solidarity with the strike, many of them because they were pressured by workers and other members of the community.

Many workers in Minnesota would already not be at work on Friday because they are hiding from federal immigration agents. Those who do come out are ​“a voice for people who are hiding,” Ghilagaber of UNITE Here Local 17 told me.

Speaking earlier this week, Freeberg told me, ​“In my mind, it is already successful. We’ve seen scores of businesses shutting down in a large part due to community pressure. There will be people in the street, but 10 times that will be staying home, not working that day. The people not shopping, the people not showing up for work, that stuff really matters too.”

“This doesn’t have to be perfect for it to be impactful,” Freeberg said. ​“There are likely tens of thousands of people who are doing the first ever workplace action that they’ve ever done, ever thought about doing, and they are going to realize that they can do this.”

He added, ​“We can all do this.”",https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/in-these-times/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GettyImages-2257850872.jpg?mtime=1769236963,N,,2026-01-24 10:58:42.021923

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has backed down from a fight to unmask the owners of Instagram and Facebook accounts monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.

DHS initially fought Doe’s motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things.” This was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties,” DHS alleged. DHS’s arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though Wired noted that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.

To Doe, the agency seemed intent on testing the waters to see if it could seize authority to unmask all critics online by invoking a customs statute that allows agents to subpoena information on goods entering or leaving the US.

But then, on January 16, DHS abruptly reversed course, withdrawing its summonses from Meta.

A court filing confirmed that DHS dropped its requests for subscriber information last week, after initially demanding Doe’s “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses.”

The filing does not explain why DHS decided to withdraw its requests.

However, previously, DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests, too, after account holders defended their First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash their summonses, Doe’s court filing said.

To defeat DHS’ summonses, Doe shared all his group’s online posts with the court. An attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Ariel Shapell, told Ars that Doe’s groups posted “pretty innocuous” content, like “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils.”

It’s possible DHS caved due to lack of evidence supporting claims that Doe’s groups’ posts carried implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS had argued. But it’s also possible that DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask ICE critics due to strong First Amendment protections working to preserve the right to post anonymously online.

DHS faces spiking ICE criticism

The attempt to unmask Doe’s accounts came as criticism of ICE is mounting nationwide, and a win could have given ICE broad authority to attack that growing base of critics if DHS had dug in and its defense actually held.

DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses could signal that the argument the agency tried to raise—weirdly using a statute tied to the “importation/exportation of merchandise” to seize “unlimited subpoena authority” of ICE critics online—is clearly not a winning one.

Meta did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. But Meta did play a role in challenging DHS’ summonses, initially by seeking more information from the agency and then notifying account holders to provide an opportunity to quash the summonses before information was shared.

So far, the playbook for community watch groups on Facebook and Instagram has been to follow Meta’s advice in order to block identifying information from being shared. But it remains unclear if Meta may have complied with DHS’s requests if account holders were not able to legally fight to quash them, perhaps leaving a vulnerable gray area for community watch groups.

For Doe and any others involved in “MontCo Community Watch,” DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses likely comes as a relief. But this wasn’t the first time DHS tried and failed to unmask online critics, so it’s just as likely that fears remain that DHS will continue trying to identify groups that are posting footage to raise awareness of ICE’s most controversial moves.

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

Tensions remain high as US citizens defend both their neighbors and their own constitutional rights. Most recently, shocking footage of ICE using a 5-year-old boy as bait to trap other family members intensified calls to defund ICE. Public backlash also raged after videos showed ICE removing a US citizen from his home in his underwear. That arrest happened while ICE was conducting a warrantless search that a whistleblower warned is becoming the new ICE norm after an internal memo said that agents can enter homes without a judicial warrant.

Some politicians are starting to take up the call to diminish ICE’s power. On Thursday, the majority of House Democrats voted to defund ICE, which Politico noted was a “remarkable shift from when dozens of them voted to expand the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement authority just one year ago.” Of course, the ICE budget bill passed anyway, since Republicans control the House, but with public approval of ICE tanking, any ongoing pushback could hurt Republicans in midterms and eventually even doom ICE if momentum is sustained.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257128839-1024x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 07:57:20.340082

And next thing you know, we’re at the Supreme Court in Washington, suing the administration.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Fed board of governors member Lisa Cook faced a choice ahead of this week’s Supreme Court oral argument: show up, or sit it out?

They chose visibility, forming part of a crowd of economic and legal heavyweights in the justices’ lines of sight as they mulled the future of the Fed’s protections from the executive branch.

Some others involved in recent high-profile Supreme Court cases have stayed away for their own strategic reasons.

But on Wednesday, Cook and a crowd of supporters became the latest to show up, hoping to persuade the justices that ruling for President Trump in her lawsuit would effectively end the Fed’s longstanding independence to run the nation’s monetary policy.

It was a physical display of the institutional stakes. Trump became the first president to try to fire a sitting Fed governor in its 113-year history when he fired Cook in August over mortgage fraud accusations, which she denies.

Cook watched the arguments from the center section of the public gallery, which spans the back half of the grandiose, column-lined room. She sat among a line of others who chatted as they waited for the justices to take the bench.

Rep. Joyce Beatty (Ohio) was one of several Democratic lawmakers who made it inside. They were part of a rally outside opposing Trump.

On the other side of the center section was Ben Bernanke, who led the Fed through the 2008 financial crisis. Now more than a decade removed from the role, he and other former top economic officials are backing Cook.

Bernanke sat with a larger group, most of whom scribbled notes throughout the two-hour session. Bernanke, however, appeared to doze off at points. By the time Justice Clarence Thomas had asked the first question, Bernanke’s eyes were closed, chin against his chest.

Inside, Powell wasn’t near any of the others. The Fed chair sat on the far-right side of the courtroom with his wife, nearly against the wall and close to the seating for Supreme Court clerks and staff.

He looked ahead toward the bench for most of the argument, his chin slightly raised, appearing to listen intently. Afterward, he quickly left the building through a side door, away from the swarm of cameras.

Powell plays a unique role in the case.

He has increasingly pushed back vocally on Trump’s attempts to influence the Fed and the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into him over his congressional testimony concerning the overbudget renovations at the Fed’s headquarters.

In Cook’s case, Powell is a named a defendant alongside the Federal Reserve itself and Trump, meaning that Solicitor General D. John Sauer at the argument was technically representing Powell, not just the president.

Powell didn’t take Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s advice not to go.

“I actually think that’s a mistake,” Bessent told CNBC Tuesday while in Davos, Switzerland, after reporting surfaced of Powell’s expected attendance.

“Because if you’re trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale is a real mistake,” Bessent continued.

Bessent himself attended Supreme Court oral arguments in November, when the justices considered the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Several other administration officials came as well.

As Bessent left the courtroom that day, he gave The Hill a thumbs up when asked how the argument went.

Even Trump himself had floated attending.

“I have an obligation to go there,” he told reporters in the Oval Office in October.

It wasn’t the first time Trump toyed with going to the Supreme Court. As he campaigned for his second term, he wanted to see oral arguments on his assertion of broad criminal immunity as a former president. But the New York judge overseeing Trump’s then-ongoing criminal trial rejected his request, ordering Trump to stay in Manhattan.

When the tariffs argument at the court came around, Trump ultimately passed on going, writing on social media, “I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.”

The next month, the Supreme Court moved to its next major battle involving Trump: his firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter.

Slaughter sat in the gallery with two other agency leaders sacked by Trump: National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox and U.S. Copyright Office head Shira Perlmutter. Their lawsuits could be impacted by the justices’ decision.

Avoiding Supreme Court oral arguments can also reveal a strategy.

At last week’s sessions on the constitutionality of transgender athlete bans, one of the two student athletes suing attended. The other did not.

Both decisions came with little surprise.

Becky Pepper-Jackson, the 15-year-old discus thrower and transgender girl challenging West Virginia’s ban, sat in. Her lawyers have stressed West Virginia’s law is all about their client.

In the first paragraph of their opening brief, they note she is the only person whom West Virginia’s law has been known to apply. And Pepper-Jackson long ago shoved aside the protections that enable minors to maintain privacy when they sue, making herself available to the press and posing for photos in front of the high court.

Lindsay Hecox, the other athlete suing, who is challenging Idaho’s ban, took the opposite approach.

She steered clear of the courtroom and did not conduct a press tour. The American Civil Liberties Union represents both students, but the post-argument press release only contained a statement from Pepper-Jackson. Not Hecox.

Hecox has been attempting to drop her lawsuit. She says negative public attention has caused her to give up trying to play college athletics, so the Supreme Court shouldn’t issue an opinion, but Idaho accuses her of trying to manipulate the court’s docket.

In the courtroom last week, Justice Sonia Sotomayor appeared the most sympathetic to Hecox. The liberal justice scoffed at Idaho’s lawyer for disagreeing that being a plaintiff in a blockbuster Supreme Court case “makes your infamy live forever.”

“Have you studied your law cases? Students do all the time,” Sotomayor bristled.

For others, attending their Supreme Court oral arguments is a no-brainer.

Victor Schwartz, the CEO of VOS Selections, the wine importer leading the fight against Trump’s tariffs, always planned to go to November’s arguments.

“I don’t get opportunities to appear at the Supreme Court as a plaintiff too often,” Schwartz told The Hill at the time.

In fact, he would’ve gotten more tickets if he could. But Schwartz only got one. It left his daughter spending hours waiting in the public line to try to get a coveted seat.

“For us, it’s amazing,” Schwartz said. “We toil away in our little importing business. And next thing you know, we’re at the Supreme Court in Washington, suing the administration.

“That’s kind of momentous.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/cooklisa_lowellabe_012126gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-24 10:59:02.367726

Thousands and thousands of people in Minnesota came out in frigid temperatures and hundreds of business were closed in protest to support getting “ICE Out!” of the state.","Every week thus far in this young, very old year, has illustrated the lengths to which the Trump administration will go to operate in bad faith with inhumane cruelty and ignore the laws and Constitution, particularly to harm, punish, and retaliate against their chosen targets and perceived opponents.

This week — at least outside of the U.S. Supreme Court — President Donald Trump’s harsh immigration enforcement tactics were front and center.

On Wednesday, the Associated Press broke the news — via a whistleblower complaint — that senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security decided last May that they were in charge of the Fourth Amendment, secretly adopting a policy that erased longstanding Fourth Amendment rights for those people subject to deportation orders.

From the explosive May 2025 memo authored by Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement:

Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose. Accordingly, in light of this legal determination, ICE immigration officers may arrest and detain aliens subject to a final under ut removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), or a U.S. district court judge or magistrate judge in their place of residence.

Although we haven’t seen that DHS Office of the General Counsel determination, DHS’s acting general counsel at the time was Joseph Mazzara.

Mazzara was most recently in the news for acknowledging that he was the person who gave DHS Secretary Kristi Noem legal advice about whether or not to turn around the Alien Enemies Act flights the night of March 15 after Chief Judge James Boasberg ordered the administration to do so. (They did not turn the flights around.)

Sometime less than two months later, per Lyons, Mazzara’s office took on the Fourth Amendment as well.

The news is horrifying, not the least of which because it was the position of DHS for the past eight months — and it wasn’t public during any of that time.

In the best piece I’ve read on this Stanford Law School professor Orin Kerr — a Fourth Amendment expert — concluded on Thursday:

[I]f I had to summarize my current thinking, it seems to me that the DHS policy is likely wrong in light of [a 1971 Supreme Court decision], [a 1972 Supreme Court decision] and [a 1980 Supreme Court decision], although the DHS position is not frivolous in light of [a 1960 Supreme Court decision] as interpreted in [a 2021 district court ruling] — and the trickier issue may be actually getting a merits ruling on the issue in court in light of the absence of remedies due to the Supreme Court’s gradual cutting back on Bivens remedies. Or at least that’s my tentative take without actually getting to see the DHS legal analysis, and with the caveat that I don’t know the administrative law remedies that may be available.

If you want to dive in, go check out his piece.

Mazzara, meanwhile, is now the deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. (Incidentally, before going to DHS, Mazzara was at the Texas Attorney General’s Office. In one notable case, he argued at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit one month before the 2024 election — in favor of nationwide injunctions.)

The church protest arrests

As that news spread, Attorney General Pam Bondi began live-tweeting arrests of Minnesota activists involved in a protest at a Minnesota church where one of the pastors is the acting head of the Minnesota ICE field office — and the man who submitted a declaration defending ICE’s tactics in Minnesota in litigation before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez alleging that the Trump administration has been violating the First and Fourth Amendment rights of protesters in the Twin Cities.

As for the three arrests carried out in response to the protest at the church where Easterwood is a pastor, DOJ unsuccessfully sought to keep the protesters detained after their arrests. As to the first two people arrested — Nekima Levy-Armstrong and Chauntyll Allen — that request was rejected both by Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko and U.S. District Judge Laura Provinzino. The third person arrested — William Kelly — was ordered released by Micko.

And yet, the three face charges in a case that appears to have been prompted largely by right-wing outrage over Don Lemon’s livestreamed coverage of the protest. The Washington Post, moreover, reported on Thursday that DOJ sought to charge Lemon as well but a judge rejected the effort.

When the criminal complaint — signed by Timothy Gerber, OHS-ICE Special Agent — was unsealed Friday as to Levy-Armstrong, Allen, and Kelly, it was clear that others — whose names were redacted — were at least initially sought to be included in the complaint.

The complaint alleges a violation of the FACE Act — an abortion clinic access law that includes a religious worship protection section — and a related conspiracy charge.

Gerber’s supporting affidavit, which strongly supports the claim that Lemon was initially one of those targeted by the effort, frames the entire complaint with Lemon’s coverage.

As the affidavit continues, Gerber’s claims veer further and further from constituting any sort of professional assessment. Here is how Gerber disgustingly described the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in a section in which Allen was discussing what chants the group preferred:

In one parenthetical sentence, Gerber:

Did not mention that ICE killed Good;

Asserted that Good was involved in an “illegal protest” (Cc: Judge Menendez);

Used the exonerative “officer-involved shooting” terminology; and

Presented to the court as fact that Good “assault[ed] … an immigration officer,” contrary to The New York Times review of available video.

This is Trump administration. Charges like this — backed up with false and misleading claims like this — will continue.

That wasn’t all this week

There are the enraging, heartbreaking stories about Liam Ramos and other children arrested by ICE.

The lawless boat-strike murders continue.

As The New York Times noted in its report, this was the “first known boat strike in the eastern Pacific since the capture of Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela“ — bringing ”the known death toll“ from the strikes “to 125 since early September.”

Also Friday night, there was still more news about Geraldo Lunas Campos — one of three people who have died at ICE’s El Paso Camp East Montana this year and whose autopsy led to a homicide finding earlier this week. The Washington Post reported that ICE staff at the facility “told [911] dispatchers the detainee had tried to hang himself — an account that appears to conflict with the medical examiner’s recent finding of a homicide while being restrained by guards.”

It’s all horrible, yes.

And yet, I don’t want to leave this on that note.

In spite of it all, the people remain my strongest reminder that the Trump administration is isolating itself and will, eventually, fail.

Thousands and thousands of people in Minnesota came out in frigid temperatures and hundreds of business were closed in protest to support getting “ICE Out!” of the state.

Judges this week also pushed back against overreach, and individuals targeted by the administration did the same — with support from lawyers willing to stand up for the law.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bBad!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b54b31b-99e8-4efc-b945-32ef06fd06a4_922x594.png",N,,2026-01-24 10:59:05.862687

Hanover officials announced Thursday that they received a communication from the federal Department of Homeland Security expressing interest in the 43-acre property at 11525 Lakeridge Pkwy., south of Interstate 95.

The 552,587-square-foot building in Ashland, known as the Lewistown 95 Logistics Center, is owned by Jim Pattison Developments. The Canada-based developer previously advertised the warehouse as a potential office and distribution center.

Federal immigration officials intend to use the property “in support of ICE operations,” the letter reads. Proposed site improvements may include installing, tentage, a guard shack and additional security access controls.

The move comes amid increasing ICE activity in the state, including an uptick around Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s inauguration on Jan. 17. Henrico County Supervisor Misty Roundtree has warned on social media about reports of door-to-door ICE sweeps in the county.

Spanberger signed 10 executive orders on her first day in office, one of which rescinds an order by her Republican predecessor, Glenn Youngkin, that directed state and local law enforcement agencies to enter into cooperation agreements with ICE for federal immigration enforcement.

(The order does not void the agreements themselves, only the statewide directive to enter 287(g) arrangements.)

Republican Congressman Rob Wittman said in a statement to VPM News that he’s been contacted by DHS officials about their interest in Virginia’s first Congressional district.

""Public safety and the rule of law are imperative in our communities, and our law enforcement officers work diligently to uphold these values,” Wittman said in a statement. “Decisions regarding federal facilities should be made thoughtfully, and I have been in contact with the Department of Homeland Security about these recent reports. I will continue to monitor the situation as more information becomes available.""

Wittman was one of several Virginia representatives who voted in favor of a federal bill that would provide funding to DHS — and ICE by extension. Every single one of Virginia's Democratic representatives voted against the bill.

Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan issued a statement regarding the DHS funding and ICE’s activities following the vote.

“This past year has seen alarming and horrific breaches of fundamental constitutional rights at the hands of ICE,” McClellan said. “Overly aggressive agents have entered homes without a warrant; detained people — including citizens — without due process, some in horrendous conditions; terrorized immigrant communities and shed the blood of American citizens.”

She added that in her district — which includes all of the City of Richmond and parts of Petersburg City and Chesterfield and Henrico counties — ICE agents are escalating their tactics.

“None of this has served to make us safer, and this disturbing pattern of behavior demands drastic action,” McClellan said. “I stand alongside all those who have continued to sound the alarm on ICE’s lawlessness and will continue to advocate for measures that will restrict and end this Administration’s heightened campaign of terror.”

Federal lawsuits challenge Las Vegas police tactics against protesters

A newly filed motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction seeks to prevent Metro police from using excessive force against peaceful protesters.

The legal action comes after body camera footage revealed officers targeting individuals who posed no threat, including Emanuel Beltran, who was shot with pepper balls while simply leaning against a light pole, wearing pink shorts and a black shirt.

""He was no threat, committed no crime, was directly targeted by SWAT, and was shot with three pepperballs,"" Beltran's lawsuit states.

His attorneys say they're filing the motion ""to remedy the enormous chilling effect on First Amendment activities that LVMPD has created.""

Another case involves protester Kathleen Cavalaro, who was shot in the back with pepper balls after following police instructions to turn away.

""What am I under arrest for? Because I called you a fascist?"" Cavalaro said during her arrest.

The June 11 protest drew hundreds who came out to oppose federal immigration enforcement policies. The lawsuit alleges Metro police, under direct supervision of Undersheriff Andrew Walsh, ""far exceeded their legitimate police powers, completely disregarded the First Amendment rights of the protesters, illegally shot hundreds of pepperballs with no threat of harm to officers or others, and improperly used their arrest powers, all with the goal of stopping the protest and extinguishing the protesters' First Amendment protected activities.""

The filing calls Metro's behavior ""eerily similar"" to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, including people shot in the back with pepper balls as they complied with orders to leave.

In a 2020 court case, U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro found ""Metro's use of pepperballs and tear gas to control crowds during the 2020 protests have likely chilled speech"" by peaceful protesters. However, Navarro denied a similar injunction request because Metro told the court it had made substantial policy changes after evaluating ""mistakes made to ensure lessons learned are not lost.""

The judge found future excessive force actions were unlikely, calling Metro's previous conduct ""uncharacteristic.""

But body camera footage from the 2025 ICE protests shows Metro using many of the same tactics five years later. Beltran's motion claims ""LVMPD either never implemented the substantial policies and changes or wholly ignored them,"" calling ""excessive use of force with pepperballs very characteristic.""

Attorneys argue Metro ""will not act on its own and Court intervention is needed.""

As protests continue nationwide following Rachel Good's shooting death by ICE in Minneapolis, the Las Vegas Federal Court is being asked to prevent Metro from enforcing dispersal orders outside specific zones after protesters comply, and to stop officers from shooting pepper balls without evidence of physical threat or serious criminal behavior.

Many demonstrators later gathered indoors at the Target Center, a sports arena with a capacity of 20,000.

Organisers and participants said dozens of businesses across Minnesota closed for the day as part of the “ICE OUT!” show of defiance that organisers billed as a general strike.

Workers headed to street protests and marches, which followed weeks of sometimes violent confrontations between US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and protesters opposed to Trump’s surge.

“It is 23 degrees below zero but the stores are closed and these demonstrators are out braving the coldest day on record since 2019 all to send a simple message to ICE: Get Out,” Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said, reporting from Minneapolis.

Just a day earlier, US Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis in a demonstration of support for ICE officers and to ask local leaders and activists to reduce tensions, saying ICE was carrying out an important mission to detain immigration violators.

In one of the more dramatic protests, local police arrested dozens of clergy members who sang hymns and prayed as they knelt on a road at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, calling for Trump to withdraw the 3,000 federal law enforcement officers sent to the area.

Organisers said their demands included legal accountability for the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Good, a US citizen, in her car this month as she monitored ICE activities.

They ignored commands to clear the road by officers from local police departments, who arrested and zip-tied dozens of the protesters, without resistance, before putting them onto buses.

Organisers said about 100 clergy members were arrested.

‘Largest strike’

Faith in Minnesota, a nonprofit advocacy group that helped organise the protest, said the clergy were also calling attention to airport and airline workers, who they said had been detained by ICE at work. The group asked that airline companies “stand with Minnesotans in calling for ICE to immediately end its surge in the state”.

Across the state, bars, restaurants and shops were closing for the day, organisers said, in what was intended to be the largest display yet of opposition to the federal government’s surge.

“Make no mistake, we are facing a full federal occupation by the United States government through the arm of ICE on unceded Dakota land,” said Rachel Dionne-Thunder, vice president of the Indigenous Protector Movement.

She was one of a series of Indigenous, religious, labour and community leaders to speak, calling on ICE to withdraw and for a thorough investigation into Good’s shooting.

Trump, a Republican, was elected in 2024 largely on his platform of enforcing immigration laws, with a promise to crack down on violent criminals, saying his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, was too lax in border security.

But Trump’s aggressive deployment of federal law enforcement into Democratic-led cities and states has further spurred political polarisation in the US, especially since the shooting of Good, the detention of a US citizen who was taken from his home in his underwear, and the detention of schoolchildren, including a five-year-old boy.

Despite grueling cold temperatures, demonstrators filled Monument Square just after 5 p.m., chanting, holding signs, and later marching down Congress Street. Their message: ICE is not welcome here.

Among those in the crowd was Ella Bornstein, a local high school student who said she came out to support her classmates.

“My school has a bunch of new immigrants, and I think it’s really important to show support for them even if I don’t know them,” Bornstein said.

Ella stood alongside her mother, Sheila Bornstein, who echoed the urgency of showing solidarity with Maine’s immigrant communities.

“It’s pretty terrifying what’s happening in our community right now. I’m here to support our New Mainer population and honestly everyone in our community that is being affected,” she said.

While other demonstrations have taken place throughout the week in other parts of the state, they've been smaller in comparison. Friday night’s protest was one of the largest since ICE began ramping up operations statewide, according to organizers.

Lindsay Walsh, who traveled from Cumberland to attend, said ICE’s actions have sown fear in communities across the region.

“People have a right to be here. Children have a right to go to school safely. Parents have a right to go to work,” Walsh told NEWS CENTER Maine. ""We’re here to protest the terrorizing of our community.”

Protesters began marching down Congress Street around 6 p.m. Many chanted slogans like, “No justice, no peace, get ICE off our streets.”

Ryan Murphy, one of the event’s organizers, said marching into the street was planned in direct response to what he called a spike in ICE arrests this week.

“This was planned in order to meet the moment,” Murphy said. ""Very pleased with the turnout, very pleased with the reception. People couldn’t be more positive.”

No arrests were made, according to the Portland Police Department.

The Cumberland county sheriff, Kevin Joyce, said that on Wednesday evening one of his corrections officer recruits was arrested by ICE agents.","Three days into its immigration crackdown in Maine, the Department of Homeland Security said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had arrested “more than 100 illegal aliens”.

In a statement to the Guardian on Friday, the DHS assistant secretary of public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, said some of those taken into custody were “the worst of the worst” and had been “charged and convicted of horrific crimes”, but cited the same four examples it released earlier in the week.

Speaking to Fox News, Patricia Hyde, deputy assistant director of ICE, said the agency had compiled a list of 1,400 individuals in Maine it intends to target.

Immigrant rights groups have been on alert as ICE concentrates its operation on Maine’s two largest cities, Portland and Lewiston. Organizers say agents have been targeting African nationals from Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola, many of them asylum seekers who have made the coastal state home in recent decades.

On Wednesday, a local ICE sighting hotline – organized and run by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition – said they received more than 1,100 calls, a 35% increase in calls from the previous day. Immigrants in Maine represent only about 4% of the state’s total population, most of whom have legal status to live and work in the US, according to a recent report by the Migration Policy Institute.

At a press conference in Portland on Thursday, Janet Mills, the state’s Democratic governor, said the Trump administration had not returned her calls since the operation began. She added that her office had received reports of people with no criminal record being detained and urged homeland security to be transparent in its actions, saying she would be “shocked” if federal law enforcement located 1,400 individuals with criminal backgrounds.

“If they have warrants, show the warrants,” she said. “We don’t believe in secret arrests or secret police.”

Mills also described widespread fear in schools, workplaces and businesses that are losing employees who have either been detained or are not showing up, despite living in the state legally.

Earlier this week, a video by 28-year-old Cristian Vaca – an Ecuadorian immigrant living in Maine with valid immigration status – went viral online. In the footage, federal agents appear outside Vaca’s home in Biddeford, 18 miles south of Portland, where he lives with his wife and young son. In an interview with the Associated Press in Spanish through a translator, Vaca said that he approached the officers when they were taking pictures outside his house.

When Vaca refused to go outside, the video shows one of the agents telling him that they will “come back for your whole family” through Vaca’s screen door.

“I have been in this country since September 2023,” Vaca, who works as a roofer, told the AP. “I have immigration status … the judge postponed my court date to another day. Now I have a new court date. I have my work permit. I have my social security number [sic].”

Local authorities also decried the scope of the federal immigration dragnet this week. The Cumberland county sheriff, Kevin Joyce, said that on Wednesday evening one of his corrections officer recruits was arrested by ICE agents.

“This is an individual that had permission to be working in the state of Maine. We vetted him,” the sheriff said of the unnamed recruit.

Joyce was one of more than 100 national sheriffs who met with Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, last year. “The book and the movie do not line up,” Joyce told reporters on Thursday. “We’re being told one story, which is totally different than what’s occurring.”

Later, Joyce said that ICE officials contacted him to say all detainees held at the Cumberland county jail were being moved on Thursday. In an interview with the Portland Press Herald, he said “about 50” people were removed from the jail. The DHS did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment about where detainees are being held as Maine does not have a dedicated immigration detention facility.

The Maine Immigrants Rights Coalition’s advocacy and policy manager, Ruben Torres, said that family members are now finding it “extremely difficult to be able to find their loved ones once they have been picked up”.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP), Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization said it had received several fearful calls as the crackdown continues. This includes a pregnant woman who reached out to ILAP because she was “terrified to leave her home to go to a medical appointment”. Another person called and said someone had “pulled the fire alarm in her building, desperately trying to save people from ICE”. ILAP said that they received reports of teachers escorting immigrant children home from school who had agents follow them and push their way into an apartment building lobby.

“It is clear the overall operation is anything but targeted,” said Sue Roche, ILAP’s executive director. “People are being racially profiled on the streets and in their cars. As is their playbook, ICE is doing everything they can to inflict maximum cruelty and chaos.”

In Lewiston, it was “hard to overstate the level of fear within the community”, according to the Democratic congressional candidate Jordan Wood, who is running to replace the outgoing US representative Jared Golden. “I have heard that as many as 20% of students at certain schools did not show up,” Wood, who was born, raised and lives in the area, told the Guardian.

He added that the community response to the ICE surge – from ensuring immigrants know their rights to sharing where agents have been spotted – has been hugely encouraging. “It’s important to just know the community that they’re coming after won’t stand idly by while our neighbors are terrorized,” Wood said.

At her press conference in Portland, Mills still wanted more information about the decision to target the Pine Tree state. “Why Maine? Why now? What were the orders that came from above? Who’s giving the orders?,” she said, adding that state officials have reached out to the Trump administration but still “have no answers”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89dad30b93631251acae781be1db651c329543e/2114_1008_3003_2403/master/3003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c94a3bddc10eb5d34e69832e00f90417",N,,2026-01-24 02:57:50.120723

Labor organizers, clergy leaders and immigrant rights groups gathered at La Placita Olvera to march down to the federal detention facility where Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds detainees. They came together less than a month after a Minneapolis woman, Renee Good, was fatally shot by an ICE agent, and protests have roiled the city as raids have continued.

L.A. City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez made an appearance and reiterated the common refrain to “abolish ICE.”

“Look at all the people around you. This is what’s going to save us from authoritarianism,” she said, addressing the hundreds that had gathered in La Placita, a historical site of Latino organizing. “I’m a council member, but the government will not save you. It’s the people that are standing arm in arm with you that are going to save our families, keep our families whole and repair the harm that the federal government is doing.”

The protest was one of several across the country as immigration raids have continued. This time, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and CLUE, a clergy organization, came together to organize a march to the detention center.

Organizers recognized the death of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who was shot multiple times by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. She had dropped off her son at school when she came upon ICE agents during a raid.

Federal officials have defended ICE agent Jonathan Ross’ actions as self-defense and have accused Good of weaponizing her vehicle in “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Local and state officials, citing video evidence, have rejected that claim, and calls to rein in ICE have escalated as her death has resonated across the country.

Among the speakers was a fast-food worker at McDonald’s, who said she feared going to work every day last summer when ICE raids were intensifying in Los Angeles. Another fast-food worker spoke of organizing in response to the fear, and said that Minnesota’s fight was also L.A’.s fight.

“From the West Coast to the Midwest, we are united with one voice to say: ICE out,” Julieta Garcia said to big cheers.

Cesar Sandoval Cruz, a sophomore at Wilson High School, said young people today are “witnessing history before our very own eyes.”

“We are seeing as our neighbors, families, strangers and everyday hardworking people are getting kidnapped off our streets,” he said. “We are here to say that enough is enough. We are not going to stand by and watch as this is taking place in our city.”

State Sen. Sasha Renee Perez, a Democrat who represents Altadena, spoke about her efforts to pass legislation that would force ICE agents to be unmasked and identify themselves. The Trump administration is challenging it in court.

Passing legislation in this moment, she said, was not enough.

“We are going to need one another as we fight this fascist administration,” Perez said. “Direct action works. Do not let anybody tell you otherwise — the people of Minnesota are proving it right now.”

Beata Landes, 23, held a sign she wrote herself: “Keep your hands off my family.”

“So many of my friends and family members are undocumented,” she said, “and the fear is palpable.”

Landes said she drove from the Westside because it was important to share solidarity with those opposed to ICE actions.

“Being around like-minded people is hopeful and inspiring,” she added.

Despite the obvious dangers of trailing and recording ICE agents, residents have continued to show up in large crowds in Minneapolis. Videos online show residents blasting whistles as they warn neighbors that ICE agents are in the area. In Los Angeles, rapid response network groups have also continued their efforts to track agents’ movements across the city.

The interactions have at times turned violent. On Wednesday, a federal agent shot at a suspect during a raid in South L.A. The Department of Homeland Security said the agent opened fire after the suspect rammed federal law enforcement with his vehicle.

As the air filled with the scent of incense and music, L.A. resident Leneta Antoine-Wood held a sign that read “ICE out of Tovaangar,” a reference to the Indigenous people of the Los Angeles Basin. Antoine-Wood, who is part Native, said she felt it was important to advocate against the raids. She said she knows someone who is being held in the Adelanto facility outside of L.A., and conditions there are worse than a prison.

“Immigrants have more rights to be here,” she said. Her shirt reading “No one is illegal on stolen land” echoed that sentiment.

Antoine-Wood and her husband, Rob Wood, have been part of several protests against ICE and government overreach. They participated in the Standing Rock demonstration against an oil pipeline through tribal land in North Dakota.

Despite acknowledging that little may change while Trump is in office, Wood said it was important to be out there to show the strength of opposition to the administration’s actions.

“His administration doesn’t follow any of the laws,” he said, and Trump himself has “no good interest in this country.”

“Everybody’s just gotta make sure that they vote,” he said. “You gotta protest.”

As the crowd prepared to march Friday to the detention facility a few blocks away, they held a moment of silence for those who have died or gone missing while in ICE custody. People held photos of those who have died — including Johnny Noviello, a 49-year-old Canadian who died in a Miami detention facility, and Brayan Rayo-Garzon, a 27-year-old Colombian who died in Missouri.

The mood lifted as the crowd began to march south.

The recent events have caused renewed backlash against Target, nearly a year after boycotts began over the company rolling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

Target CEO Brian Cornell was once an outspoken supporter of DEI initiatives following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, and the company was seen as a strong advocate for Black and LGBTQ+ businesses and customers.

But Target eliminated its three-year DEI goals and stopped participation in external diversity surveys, after the election of President Donald Trump, who opposes such policies.

In April, Cornell met with civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton and Jamal Bryant, an Atlanta pastor. Bryant shared his demands for Target to open locations on the campuses of 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), complete its 2020 pledge to spend $2 billion on Black small businesses, reinstate its original DEI hiring and promoting goals, and invest $250 million into 23 Black-owned banks.

Target has not committed to these specific demands, but the company has continued to work with organizations such as the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs, which supports Black small business founders with education, mentorship, and access to retail opportunities. The company also supported HBCU programs under its “HBCU, Always” series, an effort to connect graduates with Target’s mentorship network.

Boycotts coincide with lower profits and foot traffic

“I think what Target didn’t do very well with the whole DEI situation was management of the situation and communication,” said retail analyst Neil Saunders, who is managing director at GlobalData, citing Target’s work helping business founders, communities, and charities. “None of that has gone away, and I think it probably should have been brought to the fore more in the conversation.”

The boycott over Target’s DEI rollback coincided with a major downturn in foot traffic and sales for the company.

Still, Saunders says there is more to the company’s 19% profit slide to $689 million in the three-month period ending Nov. 1.

“Target is currently grappling with how to create a better experience for customers, because over the past few years, the experience in store isn’t as good as it used to be,” he said. “There are issues like out of stocks on some products, and that’s really just putting customers off going to Target as much as they once did, or spending as much there as they once did.”

Over the Fourth of July weekend, Saunders visited a Target and posted 15 photos on LinkedIn that documented shelves that were understocked (or completely empty) and in disarray.

“There’s too much friction from the experience,” he said, adding that consumers are more cautious about spending on discretionary items and are weighing shopping with other retailers. “Target seems to be aware of this, and it says that it is taking action, but certainly over the past year, it has been a real problem.”

In its Q3 earning call in November, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who will take over as CEO, told analysts the company is investing in resources to improve in-store stock, such as using machine learning to optimize movement between suppliers and stores.

“It’s helping us move inventory more efficiently, improve our reliability for everyday frequently purchased items, and further improve in stocks,” he said.

New crisis, new approach

Now Target is facing a new crisis, this time over ICE.

The company has not issued any public statements about ICE operations in their stores or about the two employees who were detained. Target told Fortune it has no comment on the strike in Minnesota or the backlash against the company.

On Thursday, Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer said in a memo to employees that the company’s security teams are increasing communication with Minneapolis-based workers about expected disruptions near its locations, Bloomberg reported. Senior leaders are engaging with government officials, community partners, faith leaders and other stakeholders, Kremer said in the memo.

Bloomberg reported that employees are sharing frustration over the company’s silence on internal Slack channels. Some have sent a letter to Target’s ethics team expressing concern about the lack of a statement from the company and seeking guidance on how to handle law enforcement operations. Staffers from at least two stores have told managers they’re too afraid to come into work, sources told Bloomberg.

On Jan. 15, more than 100 clergy and community members gathered at Target’s downtown Minneapolis store to present demands and ask to speak to the CEO. They urged the company to call for an immediate end to the ICE operations in the state, to deny ICE agents entry into stores without a signed judicial warrant, and to call for Congress to stop funding ICE.

Cornell agreed to meet with representatives from the protest on Thursday, according to the organizers. Clergy members involved in the meeting did not respond to a request for comment.

Saunders said Target often sees itself as a community retailer, so it’s important for the company to give community leaders a space to air their views.

He added that Target’s messaging to employees about ICE was reasonable but that everyone is hoping for a change in operational strategies and customer experience.

“It’s not going to be enough for some people,” Saunders said. “The vast majority of customers are very much in the middle. They’re interested in politics. They may have views, but they don’t let it affect their shopping decisions, not for these kind of things.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256549172-e1769208584737.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-24 02:57:57.036639

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.","MINNEAPOLIS -- The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America’s divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an “abject lie.” It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family’s attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,” she said.

The father told the child’s mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn’t leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

“Why detain a 5-year-old?” the superintendent asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

“ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as ‘bait,’” said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ”

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.”

The officers, she said, “abided by the father’s wishes to keep the child with him.""

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the “false media narrative” about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and “did everything they could to reunite him with his family.”

“Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children’s Rights, who visited the facility last week.

“The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,” Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

“I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,” Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers “get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.”

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,” he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch’s office said he was unavailable to comment.

The child’s immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn’t, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

“This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,” Homan said last year on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

The Trump administration last July issued a “Detained Parents Directive” that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE “should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.” The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

“If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child’s immigration status,” said Neha Desai, managing director at Children’s Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. “When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child’s care.”

“I’ve seen plenty of videos on social media of Ice agents just cherry picking outside of Target doors,” said Lucas Fagan. “Waiting puppy guarding for people who have any bit of color in their skin, just waiting for them to come out and get their identification.”

At least one incident involving two Target employees being detained by ICE outside of a store in Richfield circulated online, resulting in that community demanding the company stand up for its workers.

Friday’s protestors in Rochester echoed the sentiment.

The protesters faced temperature around -12 degrees.

Despite organizers suggesting people move to a car-based protest, many chose to line the sidewalks with signs and whistles instead.

Meanwhile, others provided support from the sidelines, handing out hand-warmers and other supplies to help keep people warm.

“We’re not the only ones that are handing out hand warmers,” said Annie Jurrens, who along with her three kids were providing hand-warmers, whistles, and snacks to protestors. “People are dressed for the weather. People are, doing what they can. And right now they can be here and they can be loud. So, if it’s one small thing that we can do to help everybody, then we’re going to do it.”

The Caucus shared a statement that partially said the following:

""Renée Good should still be alive today. Her death is a tragedy that was completely avoidable. Renée, her wife, and her children deserve a full investigation into the circumstances of her killing. Instead, the federal administration has callously blamed Renée for her own death.

""This is a deplorable abuse of power. Under any other circumstance where a life is taken, an investigation is conducted, and the judicial system guarantees due process. To deny an investigation is to deny justice. It ensures that the perpetrator, Johnathan Ross, is never held accountable for his actions.

10 a.m. - ICE and Border Patrol leaders speak at Whipple Federal Building

Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Marcos Charles gathered at the Whipple Federal Building to share an update on Operation Metro Surge.

They began by touting the arrests made in recent days, saying they will ""not be deterred"" in their operations. The border patrol commander then displayed the booking photos of several convicted criminals who they say are in the country illegally.

Bovino then spoke about crimes encountered at the U.S. Southern Border and chastised media outlets for a perceived lack of reporting on crimes committed by people in the United States illegally.

He then addressed the crimes against children and spoke about the 5-year-old boy, Liam Ramos, who was seen in ICE custody earlier this week.

Assistant ERO Director Charles said ICE agents stayed with Liam after Liam's father fled from them, and that family members refused to take him when they approached their home in Columbia Heights. They then claimed that the family came into the country illegally.

Lawyers for the family dispute this claim, saying they came to the U.S. the ""right"" way.

READ MORE: 5-year-old detained by ICE in Columbia Heights: Family came into US the 'right' way

School staff said during a news conference on Wednesday that an adult in the home ""begged"" agents to let them care for Liam, but that ICE agents refused. They add that Liam was ""essentially used as bait"" when he was told to approach the home.

Liam is now with his father in a detention facility in Texas, which Charles said is ""better than social services.""

They were then asked to respond to the data discrepancy between the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) and federal immigration enforcement.

Charles said it is true that the Minnesota DOC honors ICE detainers, but that issues arise when other counties and municipalities do not.

""When I say the State of Minnesota, I'm not talking about just the Department of Corrections, I'm talking throughout the state, counties, any municipalities that are holding people,"" Charles said. ""Our stats are detainers for the ones that we count. We don't go into DOC data and count their data.""

The men then spoke about the arrest of three people involved in a protest at a church in St. Paul, where activists called for the resignation of the pastor for his ICE leadership ties.

""Federal law protects the freedom of religion and the right to worship without interference,"" Marcos said. ""What theses agitators did was not a peaceful protest.""

FOX 9 reported on Thursday night that the activists were still in custody after a judge ordered their release.

9 a.m. - Renee Good shooting death ruled a homicide

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner released a report on Thursday, Jan. 22, that ruled Renee Good's death a homicide.

Her cause of death was officially listed as ""multiple gunshot wounds"" after she was ""shot by a law enforcement officer.""

7:30 a.m. - DHS calls for state and local cooperation

The Department of Homeland Security said in a post that Minnesota Gov. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey must work with the federal government to ""make America safe again.""

The post refers to a suspect who ICE agents say they were looking for when they raided the home of an elderly Hmong man in St. Paul. Agents were seen detaining the man, who was only wearing Crocs, shorts and a blanket over his shoulders, when they brought him outside in freezing weather.

It was later found that the suspect ICE was looking for had been in state custody the whole time.

Among them is a 22‑year‑old Venezuelan mother who spoke with NBC6 on the condition that her name not be used for safety reasons. She says she never imagined her path would lead her to a secluded city in southern Mexico.

The woman says she was deported on Jan. 1, along with her 3‑year‑old son. She told NBC6 she had been living in the United States with a deportation order, was apprehended in Pennsylvania and subsequently sent to Texas before being deported to Mexico.

“It took two and a half days,” she said of the journey from the U.S.-Mexico border to Southern Mexico.

A growing hub for deported migrants

Human rights groups say that southern Mexico — particularly the city of Villahermosa — has become a landing place for migrants being expelled from the U.S.

July Rodríguez, founder and director of Apoyo a Migrantes Venezolanos, a nonprofit that provides legal guidance to newly arrived migrants, says the recent deportation routes are long, exhausting, and often dangerous.

According to Rodríguez, deported migrants are typically processed in Reynosa, just across the border from McAllen, Texas. After being given food and held for about two hours, they are transported on bus by Mexican authorities approximately 14 to 16 hours south to Villahermosa. With traffic, she says the trip can exceed 24 hours.

But Rodríguez says the most troubling issue is what comes next.

Although migrants are supposed to be taken directly to Villahermosa’s immigration processing center, she says that “the reality is that it doesn’t always happen.” Some migrants report being dropped off in unsafe areas—sometimes overnight.

“We can’t cover the sun with one finger,” Rodríguez said. “These are places with very high levels of insecurity.”

Her organization has heard from engineers, architects, accountants, educators, and others who lived in the U.S. for many years — some for almost a decade — before suddenly being returned to a country they do not know.

Shelters seeing an increase in Venezuelans

In Villahermosa, shelters are feeling the impact.

Josue Martinez Leal, who works at the Amparito Shelter, says they’ve seen a noticeable rise in Venezuelan nationals arriving after deportation from the U.S. Many of them are families — women traveling with young children, like the young mother NBC6 spoke with by video conference.

In 2025, Martinez says the shelter also received Cuban, Honduran, Salvadoran, Colombian and Haitian migrants.

He believes Villahermosa may be intentionally chosen because of its proximity to Guatemala — potentially to encourage migrants to continue south and leave Mexico.

Meanwhile, U.S. deportations to Venezuela continue

While thousands of migrants remain stranded in southern Mexico, the U.S. has been sending others directly back to Venezuela.

Human Rights First reports that between February and December, nearly 80 deportation flights carried more than 14,000 Venezuelans back to their home country — including children.

Martinez says he worries about what lies ahead for migrants who now find themselves in a “third country” —neither the U.S. nor their homeland — without an immediate support network.

For the young mother NBC6 interviewed, returning to Venezuela is not an option. She says she fled an abusive relationship and hoped to build a safer future for herself and her son.

NBC6 reached out to both state and federal Mexican authorities to ask why Villahermosa is being used as a deportation destination, but received no response.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to questions about its policies regarding Venezuelan deportations.",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2026/01/vz-deported-to-mx.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-24 00:57:41.226914

In an interview with Keizertimes, Merkley said immigration enforcement and health care are two of the top concerns he is hearing from Oregonians.

“Risk of it turning into a strongman authoritarian state.” On immigration enforcement, one audience member asked what actions Merkley is taking over constituents’ concerns.","Concern over Trump administration actions and policies was the focus of many attending U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s town hall in Salem on Thursday, Jan. 22.

Marion County residents pooled into Chemeketa Community College’s auditorium for the town hall, filling most of the seats. The Oregon Democrat rescheduled the event from earlier this month due to the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland.

Several attendees spoke against immigration enforcement actions under Trump. Others expressed concern over health care and Trump actions in Venezuela. One person told Merkley that Congress impeach Trump.

In an interview with Keizertimes, Merkley said immigration enforcement and health care are two of the top concerns he is hearing from Oregonians. The third is “authoritarian overtaking of our democratic republic.”

During the town hall, Merkley criticized the Trump administration for using illegal and “aggressive” immigration enforcement tactics and other actions. He referenced a booklet handed to attendees, which he said details “the ten rules of Trump’s authoritarian playbook.”

Examples listed in the book include placing “loyalists” in powerful positions over those who are qualified and overriding Congress authority to determine funding allocations.

Merkley also criticized a “rubber stamp” Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court for failing to stand up to Trump over separation of powers, taxation authority and more.

“We are in a moment of dire risk for our democratic republic,” Merkley said. “Risk of it turning into a strongman authoritarian state.”

On immigration enforcement, one audience member asked what actions Merkley is taking over constituents’ concerns. The speaker expressed worry that Immigration and customs enforcement is becoming “paramilitary” and noted a report from the Associated Press on a federal agency memo giving agents permission to enter homes without a warrant.

Merkley said he has proposed legislation to require agents to wear identification, remove face masks and allow access to attorneys.

“None of those bills are getting heard right now,” Merkley said.

When asked if he would support abolishing ICE, Merkley responded that he doesn’t believe the immigration enforcement agency can be “rehabilitated.”

“I think ICE has to be dismantled and we have to start from scratch,” Merkley said, to applause and a standing ovation from some.

In the interview, Merkley said that in Oregon ICE has primarily focused on Woodburn, and does not inform his office of its plans.

A speaker who described herself as a health care worker of 35 years said she personally saw how the Affordable Care Act benefited people like her daughter with chronic health issues. Now that Congress failed to extend ACA tax credits, she said she is witnessing “terrible damage” to the lives of those who relied on it for health insurance.

“It grieves me. It grieves me deeply,” she said.

Merkley responded that the U.S. is “the only country where families go bankrupt over health care,” and noted that hospitals lose income when families can’t pay.

“So it’s absolutely going in the wrong direction,” Merkley said. “And so I’d like to see us have a better health care system.”

Merkley said he had previously proposed a bill extending tax credits for one year, which didn’t pass. He said the House recently passed a three-year extension, and he will push for a Senate vote after returning to Washington D.C. next week.

Looking forward to the fall elections, Merkley said in an interview that he sees “tremendous blue energy.”

“I’m seeing it in the town halls, the folks being absolutely infuriated with the attack on America’s freedom and basic system of checks and balances,” Merkley said.

It is unclear whether the federal government or Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce’s office initiated the removals. U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson’s office requested permission Thursday to move a detainee being held there to an ICE facility in Boston. It was granted by District Court Judge John Woodcock Jr., who said in a decision that the jail had no more bed space.

News of the moves came shortly after Joyce held a Thursday news conference criticizing agents for their arrest of a county corrections recruit. He was ripped from his vehicle and detained a day earlier as part of ICE’s surge into Maine.

The removals appeared to be sudden. The jail holds about 60 ICE detainees on any given day. Some of the detainees have been moved to federal prisons in New Hampshire and Rhode Island, said Anna Welch, a University of Maine School of Law professor who runs a legal aid clinic working with detainees at the jail.

“We work closely with immigrants at [the jail] and are quite surprised by this turn of events,” she said.

Neither Joyce’s office nor ICE and other federal agencies responded to questions about the moves on Friday morning. A spokesperson for Benson’s office pointed a reporter to the court filing.

Welch did not know when detainees started to be moved, describing the process as “very chaotic.” The people held at the Portland jail have typically been arrested by ICE outside of Maine.

Joyce’s office faced protests last year for holding inmates for ICE. Several people arrested in Maine in recent days have been sent to a jail in Massachusetts.

On Thursday, Joyce condemned ICE agents for “bush league” policing in the arrest of his recruit, whose car was left running on a Portland street. He described the actions of ICE agents as being in stark contrast to what he was told by Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar,” who said ICE’s priorities were securing borders and getting criminal immigrants off the street.

“Clearly, their motives are a little different than what we’ve been told, or at least in this case,” Joyce said Thursday.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kevin-Joyce.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 02:58:19.392551

As always, it will be worth watching how embattled lawmakers in tough seats talk about these subjects — if they do at all.","I just got back from Louisiana, where I talked with Republican voters about the state’s wild Senate primary contest and sampled a few too many beignets. (More on that race below.)

One thing that struck me as I chatted with voters in the Baton Rouge area: Even in deeply conservative Louisiana, there were hints of uneasiness with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“He thinks he’s picking up criminals, but he’s picking up too many U.S. citizens, as far as I’m concerned,” said Wayles Bradley, 69, who said he had voted for President Trump but didn’t consider himself “far right.”

“I wasn’t excited about the fact that the previous administration let so many people in illegally, and that was a very big concern of mine,” said a man who identified himself only as Craig T., 61, and called himself a “die-hard Republican.”

But he added, “it just seems like we’ve kind of gone 180 degrees in the other direction. I was OK with that, but it just seems like there’s a lot of — maybe it’s a little bit of overreach.”

Turns out, that sentiment is not merely anecdotal. A new poll from The New York Times and Siena University found that 61 percent of voters overall said the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement had “gone too far,” including nearly one in five Republicans, as my colleagues Jennifer Medina and Ruth Igielnik reported today. Seventy-one percent of independents said the same.

It is possible the backlash may grow as the Trump administration expands its immigration operations, pushing this week into Maine — a critical Senate battleground state.

Already, crackdowns in other cities have left indelible images, like the photograph of a 5-year-old boy in an oversized blue hat who was detained with his father by immigration authorities in the Minneapolis area this week.

Some Republicans now seem to be trying to tread a bit more carefully, with Vice President JD Vance on Thursday saying the administration was seeking to “turn down the temperature” in Minneapolis. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who faces a difficult re-election contest, raised concerns about what she called “excessive” ICE tactics in an interview with Reuters.

And other Republicans, including Senator Jim Justice of West Virginia, have called for more training for ICE, Politico reported recently, even as they often stop short of criticizing the agency.

“They need to show more balance in enforcement and more compassion and empathy in enforcement,” Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Pennsylvania Republican, told the outlet.

Of course, few Republican lawmakers are eager to voice opposition to Trump’s crackdown. And immigration — especially how to talk about enforcement — remains a challenging and divisive topic for Democrats.

The subject more broadly divides the country, too. The Times/Siena poll found that roughly half of voters support Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico. Protest politics can also be complicated for Democrats to navigate.

Two months ago, Trump’s lawyers called on the court to uphold a new Republican-friendly election map in Texas, arguing that it was a partisan gerrymander, not one driven by race.

“Plaintiffs bringing a racial-gerrymander claim have the heavy burden to show that race was the predominant factor motivating” how the map was drawn, Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer said then.

The Supreme Court agreed by a 6-3 vote and lifted a judges’ order that had blocked the Texas map, which was drawn to win five more House seats for Republicans.

Voting rights advocates had sued, noting Gov. Greg Abbott said the goal was to eliminate four “coalition districts,” which had a combined majority of Black and Latino voters and elected Democrats.

In a brief opinion, the justices said they presume state officials acted in “good faith” in drawing the maps of congressional districts.

“It is indisputable that impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple,” wrote Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.

The justices also said it was too late in the election-year calendar for reshuffling the districts again.

Undeterred, Trump’s lawyers now stake out the near opposite view to support the GOP’s attack on the California map, which was upheld by the voters in November.

“California’s recent redistricting is tainted by an unconstitutional racial gerrymander,” Sauer wrote.

He pointed to past comments from Paul Mitchell, the designated map maker, who said he hoped the Latino districts in the Central Valley could be “bolstered in order to make them most effective.”

Trump’s lawyer said District 13 in Merced County has an odd-looking “northern plume” that brings in Democratic voters near Stockton.

“California’s motivation in adopting the Prop. 50 map as a whole was undoubtedly to counteract Texas’s political gerrymander,” Sauer said. “But that overarching political goal is not a license for district-level racial gerrymandering.”

He advised the justices to declare the new California map unconstitutional and require the state to return to the former map.

The political impact of such a ruling is obvious. It would likely cost Democrats five seats in the House of Representatives.

Justice Elena Kagan, who oversees appeals from the West Coast, asked for a response from California by Thursday. That would suggest the justices may act on the GOP’s appeal in the first week of February.

Election law experts have been skeptical of the Republican arguments in the California case.

“I don’t think Republicans are likely to prevail here,” UCLA law professor Rick Hasen wrote on his Election Law Blog.

He said the legal challenge “comes too late,” the proposed remedy is too broad, and it ignores the fact that the California’s voters were focused on partisanship, not race. It’s their intent that counts, he said.

Then, Hasen added, there’s “the optics. It would be a terrible look for the Court ... to allow Texas’s Republican gerrymander to go forward but stop California’s, especially if it’s a party line vote. That might be too much even for this Court.”

There is also a key legal difference in how the appeal arrived at the court.

In Texas, a three-judge panel heard the evidence, wrote a 160-page opinion and ruled against the state in a 2-1 decision.

In the California case, by contrast, a three-judge panel heard the evidence and rejected the racial gerrymandering claim in a 2-1 decision.

In December, Kagan dissented in the Texas case and argued the court should be reluctant to overturn the factual findings of the three judges who heard the case.

The two judges in the majority in the California case said they did not see evidence of a racial gerrymander.

“We find that the evidence of any racial motivation driving redistricting is exceptionally weak, while the evidence of partisan motivations is overwhelming,” said U.S. District Judges Josephine Staton and Wesley Hsu.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d6bac8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8667x4550+0+609/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F51%2F3d%2Faf3d2b2449cb91ead60cc6d47806%2F2245723072.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 01:57:18.264388

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers.
Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025.
The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024.
“So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said.","WASHINGTON -- Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.

“I would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,” Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.

A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China’s Xinjiang region.

The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.

Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said “there was no help from the outside world” and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.

He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.

“We are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,” said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.”

Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.

“This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,” she said in a written response to a request for comment. “All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.”

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan's case, the Illinois Democrat called for “careful adherence to due process and America’s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.”

Immigrants can apply for asylum when there’s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.

Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That's about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.

The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked “abandoned” when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group’s chief operating officer. He said it's not yet clear what caused the rise.

In cities across the country, some immigrants have stopped showing up for routine hearings after agents began making arrests right in the courtrooms, turning them into deportation traps.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.

The Chinese government has denied the allegations, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Beijing tolerates little dissent, especially on issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Communist Party rule, and has largely silenced dissent through a range of coercive means, including detention and “forced disappearances.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guan's case and his fears about being deported to China.

With the footage in hand, Guan knew he had to leave the country if he was to publish it. He went first to Hong Kong without a further plan. “I played it by ear,” he said.

From Hong Kong, he flew to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could then travel without a visa, and then on to the Bahamas before sailing to Florida in October 2021. By the time he arrived, he had released most of his video footage on YouTube.

Guan settled in Queens, a borough in New York City, and said he tried to live a “stable” life. Once he had a work permit, he worked as an Uber driver and did deliveries. He cut off contact with nearly all of his relatives back in China so they would not be harassed by the police.

He said he cherished the freedom from fear he enjoyed in the U.S. Then Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched his mass deportation campaign.

Guan said he understands why Trump has taken such a radical approach.

“It's because the past immigration policy was too lax and caused resentment from many people,” Guan said, adding that he considers such fluctuations to be “normal” in a democratic society.

“No matter what it is, any issue gets both support and opposition,” he said. “I also have come to know that people in all parts of the country are protesting the government's too aggressive behavior.”

Local residents who don't know him personally have shown their support, Guan said. “So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said. “At the same time, I've felt the warmth of the U.S. society.”

Should he be released, he said he would cherish the opportunity to stay in the United States.

“I would like to do meaningful things,” Guan said. “I hope to establish some connections with others so that I can help others.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d884f0fd-936e-4fba-aa1c-509d05d41bd7/wirestory_a63ab1448c2d719523c75269095f3c0a_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-23 21:58:32.320180

""There are rules and I know them,"" said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution's Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government's forced entry into someone's home.

As a result, immigration officers have had to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people's homes without a judge's warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

The change comes as immigration arrests nationwide soar under a mass deportation campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

""But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,"" he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

""Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,"" Blumenthal said in a news release.

WATCH: To lower tensions over ICE, 'all we need is a little cooperation,' Vance says in Minneapolis

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the ""physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.""

The waiting game

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn't leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called ""knock and talks"" to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Not answering the door is a key part of know-your-rights trainings

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They've held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

READ MORE: A U.S. citizen says ICE forced open the door to his Minnesota home and removed him in his underwear after a warrantless search

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School's Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo ""quite disturbing.""

""Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it's sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,"" he said. ""They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.""

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

""They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,"" he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

""They call it 'know-your-rights,'"" he said last year on CNN. ""I call it 'how to escape arrest.'""

Experts warn barging into homes could put all at risk

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they're at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a ""reasonable chance to act lawfully."" But if that doesn't work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-18T214723Z_1338556290_RC2W3JACU5AU_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 21:58:50.818220

And no one, no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist, can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties.

It is very striking. I was talking to one former ICE official who told me that you would always fear discharging your weapon in an interaction, even a potentially violent and a dangerous one. Usually the concern was that officers would be too unwilling to use their gun because they worried about potential repercussions. And there were all these layers of investigation that would take place after a shooting. And so his fear when he was in ICE for 30 years was that he wouldn’t use his gun in a moment when he needed to. And now it’s almost as if the opposite fear is true. And we’ve seen within ICE people losing their jobs. High-level officials losing their jobs because they’re not delivering enough deportations. They’re not being aggressive enough.

“The safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system depend on restoring law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime rather than simply turning the federal government into an immigration enforcement machine.”

Text of Letter (PDF)

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), along with Representative Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) led 27 lawmakers in writing to the Inspectors General for the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State (State), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), and the Office of Tax Administration (TIGTA), asking the watchdogs to investigate the impact of the Trump administration’s diversion of law enforcement resources away from white collar and corporate crime and in favor of immigration enforcement.

“The Trump Administration is letting white collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing. Instead of protecting American families from fraud and predatory behavior, the Administration is diverting resources to pursue its inhumane immigration agenda,” said Senator Warren. “Nobody is above the law, and the Trump Administration needs to stop treating white collar criminals with kid gloves.”

“The Trump Administration’s diversion of critical resources and personnel away from white-collar crime undermines our country’s ability to combat fraud schemes, market manipulation, and corruption—seriously threatening the security of American families and leaving them vulnerable to predatory practices. These staff and resource diversions exemplify this Administration’s reckless decision-making in service of Trump’s brutal, ruthless immigration enforcement agenda. I call on the Inspectors General to fulfill their duty as nonpartisan watchdogs and illuminate this Administration’s abuse of power,” said Senator Blumenthal.

“Trump is letting white collar criminals run rampant without consequences so he can shift law enforcement to violently attack immigrants - the overwhelming majority of whom have no criminal record,” said Representative Goldman. “Having 25,000 fewer law enforcement personnel investigating and prosecuting white collar crime enables fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and other crimes that hurt the American people. Federal Inspectors General must conduct a thorough investigation of the impact of these diversions.”

Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined in signing the letter, as did Representatives Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), Wesley Bell (D-Mo.), Lou Correa (D-Calif.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), John Garamendi (D-Calif.), Henry Johnson (D-Ga.), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Dave Min (D-Calif.), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.).

“When white-collar criminal enforcement is neglected, the American public pays the price. Ordinary people are left more vulnerable to fraud schemes, market manipulation, predatory financial practices, and corruption…while the wealthiest bend the rules and exploit a weakened enforcement system that no longer holds them accountable,” said the lawmakers.

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has reportedly diverted over 25,000 law enforcement personnel to immigration enforcement. Many of those agents had been dedicated to combating white-collar crimes—including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and more.

Those diversions include:

Nearly one quarter of FBI agents nationwide;

More than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation employees;

Around 300 State Department Diplomatic Security Service agents;

More than 90 percent of the Homeland Security Investigations workforce;

Dozens of career prosecutors from DOJ’s Public Integrity Section and National Security Division; and

Even members of the US Postal Inspection Service.

“Taken together, these moves represent a massive diversion of specialized law-enforcement talent away from criminal financial investigations and prosecutions and toward civil immigration enforcement,” wrote the lawmakers.

Several agencies are experiencing the consequences of these diversions. For example, the mass reassignment of HSI agents to immigration removal operations means that “critical threats could go uninvestigated.” Diverting State Department resources to ICE weakens cross-border investigations into corruption, fraud, and international financial crimes. The diversion of FBI and DOJ personnel from white-collar units has caused delays and the deprioritization of complex financial crime cases such as public corruption, corporate fraud, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prosecutions.

These diversions “undermin[e] the federal government’s ability to hold powerful actors accountable,” said the lawmakers.

In 2024 alone, for example, the IRS Criminal Investigations team helped recover more than $9 billion in fraudulent proceedings—acting on a budget of just $800 million. It’s unclear how the diversions are affecting agencies’ ability to investigate fraud, but the moves remove the federal government’s dedicated team to tackle white-collar crime.

“In practice, these diversions also undermine deterrence: when white-collar criminals believe that federal enforcement units lack the resources or continuity to pursue long-term cases, they may become more emboldened to take risks that endanger markets, taxpayers, and public institutions,” wrote the lawmakers.

“The safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system depend on restoring law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime rather than simply turning the federal government into an immigration enforcement machine,” the lawmakers concluded.

The lawmakers asked the IGs to provide the information below as a part of their investigation:

A breakdown of how many law enforcement personnel have been reassigned from each agency for immigration enforcement;

A breakdown of how many white-collar crimes cases (including but not limited to financial fraud, corruption, FCPA, and money-laundering cases) have been opened, closed, or suspended since the start of the second Trump administration;

Any internal assessments conducted by agencies to determine the impacts of diverting law enforcement resources; and

An accounting of complaints or whistleblower disclosures received about these diversions;

A list of the safeguards that exist to ensure each agency still meets its statutory white-collar criminal investigative obligations despite these diversions.

More than 65,000 people are currently in ICE custody, a two-thirds jump since Trump took office.","US immigration enforcement faced mounting scrutiny Friday from international officials as well as congressional Democrats after a detainee death ruled a homicide by a county medical examiner in Texas. The disturbing development comes amid record deaths in Homeland Security custody.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk called on the US to ensure that its immigration policies comply with international law, citing reports of arbitrary detentions, family separations, and dehumanizing treatment. And Democratic lawmakers demanded that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem answer for a growing death toll in immigration detention since President Donald Trump took office for his second term.

The medical examiner in El Paso County found this week that Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant held at a local Homeland Security detention camp, died of asphyxiation on January 3—a homicide. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initially said Campos died after staff “observed him in distress.” The Washington Post reported witness testimony that camp guards had choked him to death.

The homicide finding adds to intensifying controversy over deaths involving ICE, following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.

The UN’s Türk said that individuals are being detained “sometimes violently” at hospitals, places of worship, schools, and homes, “often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants.” He noted that children are missing school and medical appointments out of fear of family separation.

“States have the authority to establish their national migration policies, but this needs to be carried out in full accordance with the law,” Türk said. “Adhering to due process is crucial to the legality and legitimacy of any policy.”

Türk’s statement comes amid declining public support for ICE. A New York Times/Siena University poll of 1,625 registered voters conducted Jan. 12-17 found that 61 percent of voters believe ICE tactics have “gone too far,” including 71 percent of independents and 19 percent of Republicans. Across the political spectrum, just 26 percent of voters thought the enforcement tactics used by ICE were “about right.”

In Friday’s statement, Türk also called for an independent investigation into deaths in ICE custody, adding that 30 people are reported to have died in ICE custody since President Donald Trump took office for his second term on Jan. 20, 2025. This marks the highest figure since 2004, and there have already been a further six deaths reported in ICE custody so far this year.

The ICE detainee death reporting website lists only 18 deaths for fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, but the page has not been updated since October and does not yet include figures for fiscal year 2026. More than 65,000 people are currently in ICE custody, a two-thirds jump since Trump took office.

“We cannot abide living under this federal occupation of Minnesota,” Tollgaard said.

Protesters demand ICE leave Minnesota

The Rev. Elizabeth Barish Browne traveled from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to participate in the rally in downtown Minneapolis, where the high temperature was minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit despite a bright sun.

“What’s happening here is clearly immoral,” the Unitarian Universalist minister said. “It’s definitely chilly, but the kind of ice that’s dangerous to us is not the weather.”

Protesters have gathered daily in the Twin Cities since Jan. 7, when 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.

Sam Nelson said he skipped work so he could join the march. He said he’s a former student of the Minneapolis high school where federal agents detained someone after class earlier this month. That arrest led to altercations between federal officers and bystanders.

“It’s my community,” Nelson said. “Like everyone else, I don’t want ICE on our streets.”

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses statewide have closed in solidarity with the movement, from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 participating groups.

DHS confirms the detention of a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old

A 2-year-old named Chloe was detained with her father as they drove home from a grocery store in South Minneapolis on Thursday, according to a GoFundMe page created by Minneapolis City Council member Jason Chavez.

Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Border Patrol arrested Elvis Tipan Echeverria of Ecuador and that the toddler’s mother refused to take her so she was reunited with her father at a federal detention facility.

According to an emergency petition filed in federal court, a district judge granted an emergency injunction ordering Chloe’s release into the custody of her lawyer. The child, a citizen of Ecuador who was brought to Minneapolis as a newborn, has a pending asylum application and is not subject to a final order of removal.

DHS repeated its allegation Friday that the father of 5-year-old Liam Ramos abandoned him during his arrest by immigration officers in Columbia Heights on Tuesday, leading to the child being detained, too.

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Liam was detained because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, “fled from the scene.” The two are detained together at the Dilley Detention Center in Texas, which is intended to hold families. McLaughlin said officers tried to get Liam’s mother to take him, but she refused to accept custody.

The family’s attorney Marc Prokosch said he thinks the mother refused to open the door to the ICE officers because she was afraid she would be detained. Columbia Heights district superintendent Zena Stenvik said Liam was “used as bait.”

Prokosch found nothing in state records to suggest Liam’s father has a criminal history.

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative away from Liam’s detention by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

Details from Good’s autopsy

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner posted an initial autopsy report online for Good that classified her death as a homicide and determined she died from “multiple gunshots wounds.”

A more detailed independent autopsy commissioned by Good’s family said one bullet pierced the left side her head and exited on the right side. This autopsy, released Wednesday through the Romanucci & Blandin law firm, said bullets also struck her in the arm and breast, although those injuries weren’t immediately life-threatening.

Antonio Romanucci, an attorney for the family, said in a statement that the family is still awaiting the full report from the medical examiner and “hope that they communicate with Renee’s family and share their report before releasing any further information to the public.”

The demonstration took place on “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom,” a general strike supported by Minnesota unions, progressive faith leaders and community activists. Proponents encouraged all Minnesotans to stay home from work, school and refrain from shopping — disruptions of normal orders of business to protest the presence of federal immigration agents in Minnesota.

The massive protest began at The Commons Park at 2 p.m. in Minneapolis. The march ended with a rally at Target Center.

Natasha Dockter, the first vice president of the Minneapolis Federation of Educators’ teachers chapter, handed out hand warmers to demonstrators at The Commons alongside other teachers.

“I’m out here today because what’s going on in our city is completely and totally unacceptable. It’s impacting the lives of our students and their families that we serve,” Dockter said.

Sergey Goro and Ben Daniel were visiting the Twin Cities from San Francisco and Seattle for the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships, which was delayed due to the extreme cold.

Goro said that he’d been to No Kings protests — demonstrations against the Trump administration’s authoritarian policies — in San Francisco, but that they weren’t as large as the Minneapolis protest.

Daniel agreed: “We can really feel that everyone’s on board here — that this is ridiculous and it’s gotta stop.”

Daniela Morales, 16, carrying a Mexican flag, said her parents are both Mexican immigrants and that she attended the protest on behalf of people who can’t speak out.

“I’m really glad to see everybody come out and support each other and our neighbors and fight against the administration,” Morales said.

Other protests led to arrests

A morning protest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport led to the arrests of roughly 100 clergy by MSP and Bloomington law enforcement Friday, according to a statement from protest organizers.

Demonstrators at the airport were standing or kneeling on the roadway outside Terminal 1’s departures area and led away by law enforcement.

Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said in an email that the airport “worked in advance with event organizers to best accommodate their right to freedom of expression while also ensuring uninterrupted operations.”

“When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1,” Lea wrote. Lea confirmed there were around 100 arrests.

At least one demonstrator was also arrested at the nearby Whipple Federal Building, where federal agents deployed chemical irritants into a crowd of protestors, the Star Tribune reported. Around noon, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had given three dispersal orders for protestors to unblock an access road at the building. The Whipple Building, now a base for federal immigration operations, has been an ongoing site of protests.

Life stood still Friday for many Minnesotans. Over 700 businesses closed Friday to support the “ICE Out” day, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the demonstration’s website states.

Establishes language access technical standards that allow individuals with LEP to access agency content.

WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Rep. Judy Chu (CA-28), Chair Emerita of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), joined Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-51), and Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10) in introducing the Language Access for All Act of 2026 to codify language access requirements for federal agencies, including translation and interpretation services under threat from the Trump administration.

In March 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 14224 that declared English as the official language of the United States and revoked EO 13166, a 25-year-old mandate that required agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide critical language access to individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). The Trump administration's Department of Justice issued new guidance that minimizes multilingual services and redirects resources towards English language education and assimilation.

These policy changes threaten language access for the over 25 million individuals in the United States—eight percent of the U.S. population—with limited English proficiency. Asian Americans have among the highest language access needs of any racial group, with 32 percent having LEP. 12 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders also have significant language access needs. And while Spanish language speakers make up the majority of those who speak another language in the United States, nearly 40 percent report speaking English “less than very well” in the most recent U.S. Census.

The Language Access for All Act of 2026 modernizes and strengthens the federal government’s approach to language access by codifying EO 13166 and establishing a coordinated, accountable framework to ensure meaningful access for individuals with limited English proficiency. The legislation promotes consistency across agencies, increases transparency and public engagement, and updates federal language access policy to reflect evolving technologies.

“For more than 25 years, both Democratic and Republican presidents have supported language accessibility across the federal government. Trump’s roll back of these protections is simply wrong. In my district, translation services are essential for parents applying for a home loan, seniors accessing Medicare, immigrants starting a small business, and disaster survivors accessing the FEMA’s resources. That is why I’m proud to co-lead the Language Access for All Act to ensure no one is denied health care, housing, or disaster assistance because English is not their first language. Language access is a civil right and rolling back these services is an attack on our immigrant communities,” said Congressmember Judy Chu (CA-28).

“Every American deserves equal access to federal services and programs in a language they can understand. Language access is essential to ensure individuals are able to access small business loans or receive the right medical care,” said Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. “I am proud to introduce the Language Access for All Act alongside my colleagues to safeguard translation services for individuals with limited English proficiency, including millions in the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community. We will continue to fight against the Trump administration's attacks on immigrants and the essential services that our communities rely on and deserve.”

“For decades, federal language access services have helped millions of people file taxes, get emergency alerts, apply for loans, and access health care. Trump’s decision to designate English as our country’s official language and attempt to scrap these critical services is dead wrong,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-51). “No one should be locked out of federal programs because of the language they speak. This legislation is critical as we fight to push back on Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda and keep in place the services our communities rely on.”

“In my district, in the most linguistically diverse city on earth, language access mandates across the federal government helps ensure that everyone has meaningful access to housing loans, health care, workforce programs, and life-saving emergency alerts. Trump's attempt to roll back language access is just one of his many xenophobic attempts to attack immigrant communities, and it is completely unacceptable. I am proud to be introducing legislation to restore common sense requirements and ensure information about basic government services is made available to all,” said Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10).

The Language Access for All Act of 2026:

Requires federal agencies to ensure that individuals with LEP can meaningfully access the federally conducted programs and activities of the agency, including through translation and interpretation.

Creates a public complaint system to track complaints regarding barriers to meaningful access at agencies.

Requires agencies to develop and maintain language access plans consistent with EO 13166, with public notice and comment, and to submit plans to Congress and publish them on LEP.gov.

Establishes language access technical standards that allow individuals with LEP to access agency content. This applies to all agency communications, including AI and automated language assistance services.

Ensures AI-assisted language services do not replace qualified translators and interpreters, comply with federal privacy requirements, and are continuously tested for bias, discrimination, and errors.

Creates an interagency language access working group to provide guidance, coordination, and technical assistance.

Requires each agency to designate a language access coordinator to lead implementation and serve as a point of contact.

Together, these reforms aim to improve service delivery, reduce barriers to access, and ensure federal agencies are equipped to meet the language needs of the public.

This bill builds upon Congressmember Chu’s longstanding commitment to ensuring language accessibility, beginning with her work as a City Councilmember, fighting against an ugly “English-only” movement in her hometown of Monterey Park. On August 15, 2025, Reps. Chu, Meng, and Vargas led 58 House colleagues in a letter to President Trump and the Department of Justice, on the administration’s rollback of language access across federal agencies and its impact on LEP communities. On April 11, 2025, Rep. Chu also led an oversight letter with Rep. Meng and 54 other House Democrats opposing the initial release of President Trump’s EO 14224.

The call, organised by a coalition of community groups, also urges a suspension of consumer spending.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN,” the group organising the protest wrote on its website.

There are solidarity marches in cities across the US, including New York City, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Seattle, among others.

At the Minneapolis protest, the group is also planning a march that begins at 2pm local time (20:00 GMT) and ends at the Target Center — an arena in downtown Minneapolis.

Eyes on Target

The big-box retailer, in particular, has been in the crosshairs of organisers because of the company’s close ties to Minneapolis, where its headquarters are located, and it is the state’s fourth-largest employer.

The group is calling for Target stores to exercise protections under the Fourth Amendment, which would mean federal agents do not have the legal authority to enter a residence or place of business without a warrant signed by a judge.

In a document shared with organisers, the group pointed to two incidents of concern. One on January 8, when Customs and Border Patrol aggressively forced two US citizens onto the ground and subsequently detained them while working at a store in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, and another three days later in nearby St Paul, where Customs and Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino entered a store with other agents.

“Where Target leads, others follow. Our state is under occupation from federal agents, and they are attacking Minnesotans quite literally inside of Target stores. We need Target to stand with Minnesotans against these attacks,” the document said.

Target has been quiet about the protests and calls from its workers to take a stance. The company sent a memo to staff, according to Bloomberg News, warning of potential disruptions.

The pressure by anti-ICE protesters is the latest in a wave of pushback against the retail giant by progressives in the past year. There was a call for boycotts after the company rolled back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the company later attributed to a reason for a downturn in sales in early 2025.

The looming tensions have not made a dent on Wall Street, as the company’s stock is up 1.3 percent in midday trading.

Target did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

The political response

“The Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement operations have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets – including rapists, murderers, burglars, drunk drivers, and more. Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe. Joe Biden and Democrat leaders should’ve never let countless dangerous criminal illegals enter our country to begin with. And now the Trump Administration is cleaning up the Democrats’ mess,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Al Jazeera in a statement.

When pressed for a response to this reasoning and asked whether ICE would commit to holding accountable agents who break the law, the White House declined to provide additional comment.

The allegations concerning the agency’s conduct have led to the protests, including claims that ICE’s actions violated First and Fourth Amendment protections and threats towards protesters.

Among them are the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a case that has drawn scrutiny from civil liberties advocates, and the Department of Justice’s decision not to investigate the agent behind the shooting, which has invoked further outrage. One of the economic blackout’s calls is to hold Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot and killed Renee Good, legally accountable.

“I understand why people are choosing to participate in the January 23 blackout, and I support those decisions. At the same time, our small businesses, especially immigrant-owned businesses, are under a lot of pressure right now, and they could really use our support. However you choose to show up, I hope we keep our neighbours and local businesses in mind,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.

“Every Minnesota lawyer takes an oath to uphold the United States and Minnesota Constitutions. Upholding the rule of law and constitutional protections are fundamental promises made to each person in our country. When governmental action instills fear and deters people from engaging with government, reporting crimes, appearing in court, or seeking legal counsel, the justice system itself is undermined.

By the end of November 2025, ICE was using 104 more facilities for immigration detention than at the start of the year, a 91% increase.
With release on bond no longer an option for many people seeking relief, and deleterious conditions inside facilities, immigrants are increasingly giving up.
As of November 2025, 14.3 people were deported directly from detention for every one person released from ICE detention pending a hearing.
Inside ICE detention itself, the conditions that have resulted from this rapid expansion for those caught up in the detention system have increasingly worsened and become more inhumane.","When President Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was holding roughly 40,000 people in a national network of detention centers on any given day. In just one year, this number has increased by over 75%, with a record 73,000 people being held in detention as of mid-January.

A new report by the American Immigration Council details the unprecedented growth of ICE detention over President Trump’s first term, which has been fueled by a staggering $45 billion in funding for ICE detention included in the signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The report chronicles how the ICE detention system has grown larger, more abusive, and more opaque than ever as the Trump administration rushes to detain ever-greater numbers of immigrants as part of its mass deportation push.

What the report finds:

The number of people held in ICE detention on any given day increased by over 75% in one year.

By the end of November 2025, ICE was using 104 more facilities for immigration detention than at the start of the year, a 91% increase.

The Trump administration has dramatically changed the profile of who is being arrested by increasing the use of “at-large” arrests in American communities by 600%, leading to an unprecedented deployment of federal law enforcement.

With the funding provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE has enough funding to operate upwards of 135,000 detention beds through the end of FY 2029.

These changes in arrest practices have led to a 2,450% increase in the number of people with no criminal record being held in ICE detention on any given day.

President Trump’s executive order calling for the maximum use of detention has created a “no release” system where increasingly few individuals are able to seek release on bond. By the end of November 2025, discretionary releases from detention fell by 87%.

With release on bond no longer an option for many people seeking relief, and deleterious conditions inside facilities, immigrants are increasingly giving up. As of November 2025, 14.3 people were deported directly from detention for every one person released from ICE detention pending a hearing.

How the detention and enforcement system has changed under Trump

The changes that have occurred in detention go beyond basic questions of infrastructure and development of the capacity to detain. As immigration enforcement has become the top priority of federal law enforcement, major shifts have occurred in the profile of who is arrested, and therefore who is detained.

T These changes have resulted from the expansion of “at-large” arrests in American communities, worksite raids at farms, construction sites, factories, and other businesses, and new “re-arrest” policies at ICE check-ins and immigration courthouses. American communities are now seeing a level of immigration enforcement utterly unprecedented in modern history, leading to a rising backlash and clashes between protestors and DHS officials.

Once people have been arrested, changes in policy have kept them locked up in detention centers for longer or indefinitely, including the establishment of an official no-release policy and the expanded use of “mandatory detention” laws to deny the right to seek bond. People who would have been released by any past administration are now being pressured into giving up their day in court. Immigration judges have been directed to deny bond to thousands of people who were previously eligible, and ICE officers have been told that only high-level officials can approve humanitarian releases.

As more people are detained, those held by ICE are suffering the consequences of the rapid expansion of detention infrastructure. ICE has signed extensive new contracts with private prison companies to reopen shuttered prisons and detention centers or expand existing facilities. At the same time, the agency has begun experimenting with new models for immigration detention of people arrested inside the country, including partnering with Florida on an unprecedented state-based detention center (the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” and the opening of a tent camp on a military base in El Paso).

New plans suggest that the administration may even purchase unused commercial warehouses and convert them into jails to hold thousands of people at a time. This expansion has come alongside the reduction of both internal and external oversight into conditions on the ground, making it harder than ever to track what is going on inside facilities or ensure that contractors are following the law.

Inside ICE detention itself, the conditions that have resulted from this rapid expansion for those caught up in the detention system have increasingly worsened and become more inhumane. With more arrests than detention beds to hold people, ICE facilities saw significant overcrowding in 2025, worsening and substandard medical care, growing complaints of abusive conditions, and documented extensive violations of detention standards. As the system expands before officials ensure there are enough staff or infrastructure in place, people have been “disappearing” for days as ICE’s detainee locator system has become unreliable and access to phones uncertain. Sadly, 2025 was the deadliest year for ICE detention on record, and 2026 is looking to be worse.

A system of detention, which did not fully take off until the mid-1990s, is now on track to rival the entire federal criminal prison system by the end of President Trump’s second term in office. With the Trump administration hoping to get over 100,000 detention beds or more online in 2026, ICE detention and the ongoing abuses inside these facilities will only grow more numerous. As the report documents, it will ultimately be on Congress to rein the agency back in. But until that happens, the system is likely to grow even larger for now; and unfortunately the consequences may be deadly.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-impact-report-detention.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:57:56.937561

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.","SAN DIEGO -- Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said U.S. immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door.

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government’s forced entry into someone’s home.

As a result, immigration officers have been forced to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

The shift comes as President Donald Trump's administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.”

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn’t leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They’ve held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing.”

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it’s sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,'” he said last year on CNN. ""I call it ‘how to escape arrest.’”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you're not safe even in your own house.”

And now there are new questions being raised about ICE's warrants to enter homes.

A whistleblower group leaked an internal memo from ICE, suggesting federal agents can rely on administrative warrants to make arrests instead of judicial warrants.

That would mean a judge does not have to sign off for agents to enter a suspect's home.

The whistleblower group argued this violates Department of Homeland Security's own policy.

They also said it violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.

Here at home, the latest turn of events is alarming civil rights advocates.

The Aloha State is known as a melting pot with generations of immigrants and multiethnic people.

Some of them are now worried federal officers may be allowed enter a home without a judge's warrant.

""It is very terrifying and scary that they could potentially just target homes,"" said a Hawaii resident who asked to remain anonymous because her family member was deported. ""We're very worried for communities, we are a state made up of immigrants.""

""Raised here, there's a sense of community, there's a sense of belonging, respect for the host culture as well as respect for the diversity of culture,"" she added. ""I just hope that that survives.""

The latest immigration policy is alarming advocates at the ACLU of Hawaii.

""This policy puts everybody at risk because we know that there are mistakes that are getting made and that any immigration officer can sign one of these administrative warrants,"" said Emily Hills, the ACLU's senior staff attorney.

She said the Fourth Amendment is all about checks and balances and making sure that the government is operating appropriately and within constitutional limits.

""It makes you question, 'Is it going to be me next, right?' For me personally as a naturalized US citizen from the Filipino community, those are things that that come to mind,"" said Sergio Alcubilla, the ACLU's director of community engagement.

And the uncertainty is widespread.

""You're pitting immigrant communities against each other—legal, illegal—making folks wonder 'Is my neighbor here, you know, legally?' And those are things that don't sit well with people here in Hawaii,"" Alcubilla said.

Why it matters: For the 2028ers, voting ""no"" on a bill that's likely to pass the Senate next week is an easy way to signal their outrage at a president whose actions and policies they detest.

But for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), it's another reminder that funding a government controlled by President Trump can quickly inflame his base, especially if his colleagues are fanning the flames.

The intrigue: Schumer hasn't said how he'll vote on the minibus the House passed Thursday, but, earlier this month, he took the idea of another government shutdown off the table.

Last March, Schumer was filleted for supporting a short-term funding bill.

In September, he course-corrected and touted his willingness to shut down the government.

On its own, the 2028ers' opposition wouldn't be enough to derail plans to prevent a government funding lapse after Jan. 30, but that could change if more Democrats join them.

What they are saying: Many of the Democratic senators weighing a run for the White House in 2028 have been vocal on the issue, particularly Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has consistently demanded reforms to ICE and threatened to vote against funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was also clear on MSNOW on Tuesday night: ""I've said repeatedly that I will not support one dime of funding for Trump's lawless ICE operations. I will vote no.""

""Yeah, I am not voting to give whatever ICE has become more taxpayer money,"" Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said on X on Wednesday.

""I will vote against this bill when and if it comes to the Senate,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on X on Thursday.

""I will not vote to fund DHS and ICE,"" Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said on X last week.

Between the lines: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) suggested at an event in Michigan this week that she may not support DHS funding, but hasn't been definitive.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has not taken a public position.

The other side: House Democrats got a separate vote on funding for ICE, with 206 voting against it and only seven supporting. It passed, 220-207.

Compare that with the remaining three bills — which will fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, HHS, Education, Transportation and HUD — in the minibus. That passed 341-88, with 64 Democrats voting against it.

The bottom line: The minibus — which will include six bills in the Senate — doesn't appear in danger of failing at the moment, but the margins will be interesting.

Judge questions Trump's authority for $400 million ballroom project

Preservation group seeks injuction halting work

Ruling expected in coming weeks

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A judge in Washington on Thursday sharply questioned whether President Donald Trump's administration had authority to proceed with the construction of a $400-million White House ballroom on the site of the demolished East Wing.

At a hearing in a lawsuit brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon raised doubts whether Trump had statutory power to tear down the East Wing with plans to build a ballroom in its place without approval or oversight from the U.S. Congress.

Leon snapped, ""Come on, be serious"" after a lawyer for the administration drew parallels to the erection of a pool during the Gerald Ford administration in the 1970s and other smaller renovations.

Leon said he would aim to issue a ruling in the coming weeks on the National Trust's request for a preliminary injunction to stop work on the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) ballroom.

The National Trust sued Trump and several federal agencies in December, arguing the project has proceeded without required approvals, environmental review or congressional authorization.

The group says federal law bars construction on federal parkland in Washington without the express authority of Congress. It also argues the National Park Service violated federal law by issuing an environmental assessment instead of a full impact statement, and by releasing it after demolition began on the 120-year-old East Wing.

Leon in December declined to issue a temporary restraining order in the case. The White House and other federal defendants have urged the court to deny a preliminary injunction, which would force an end to construction while the lawsuit proceeds.

The administration has defended the legality of the project, arguing it followed in a long line of presidential renovations, including Franklin D. Roosevelt's construction of the East Wing itself.

The ballroom is needed for state functions, its design is still evolving, and above-ground construction is not planned until April, making an injunction unnecessary, the administration said in a court filing.

Justice Department lawyer Jacob Roth asserted at Thursday's hearing that the ballroom plans advance the public interest.

The National Capital Planning Commission held a hearing earlier this month about the ballroom plans, the first time plans for the ballroom had been discussed in a public forum. The White House submitted an application for the project to the NCPC and the Commission of Fine Arts last month.

Human Trafficking Prevention Month presents an opportunity for DHS and DOJ, through Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTF), to intensify operational efforts, raise public awareness, and strengthen partnerships across federal, state, and local agencies to disrupt trafficking networks, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure traffickers are brought to justice.

“Through the Homeland Security Task Force, President Trump is taking the fight directly to human trafficking networks and disrupting their modern-day slave trade while seizing their assets and arresting their kingpins and foot soldiers. The American people should not have to live in fear of cartels, gangbangers, and foreign terrorists preying upon the most vulnerable among us,” the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a statement. “The Homeland Security Task Force is the largest coordinated campaign against transnational criminal organizations in U.S. history, and I’m proud to co-lead it with Attorney General Bondi.”

“This Department of Justice is working tirelessly alongside our partners to dismantle human trafficking networks, help survivors, and protect vulnerable populations from being exploited,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Under this administration we have seen an increase in human trafficking prosecutions, and during Human Trafficking Prevention Month we reaffirm our commitment to prosecuting traffickers and encourage Americans to report instances of human trafficking in their communities.”

“During Human Trafficking Prevention Month, the FBI reiterates our work with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies and national victim-based advocacy groups in joint task forces to protect our communities across the country,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “The horrifying reach of human trafficking spreads far and wide. Homeland Security Task Forces are fighting back to disrupt these perilous networks and put a stop to that reach. The FBI will continue our investigations and bring justice to those exploited by human traffickers.”

In January 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 14159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion. Section 6 of this order directed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly establish HSTFs in every state nationwide. The HSTF objective is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) throughout the United States; dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks; end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children; and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.

In January 2026, DHS and DOJ are surging resources to fight and raise awareness about human trafficking, including:

Identifying ongoing investigations and prioritizing featured operations across 45 federal locations and 10 state locations with an emphasis on border states.

Coordinating with FBI Human Trafficking Squads and multi-agency Human Trafficking Task Forces to conduct victim recovery.

Partnering with AMTRAK and FAMS to increase law enforcement resources and distribute posters with QR codes for reporting human trafficking in all station bathrooms and trains.

Running advertisements related to $250 million recovery from Backpage to distribute to victims and additional victim restitution efforts by DOL-OIG.

Organizing Human Trafficking seminars and outreach events with DHS Center for Countering Human Trafficking at high schools and colleges to highlight the role of HSTFs in addressing human trafficking.

On August 25, 2025, HSTF officially launched its effort to protect the Homeland with a September Surge encompassing 400 operations nationwide. In just 43 days, HSTF nationwide operations resulted in 3,266 arrests and seizures including:

1,041 Sinaloa members,

856 Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (“CJNG”) members,

641 MS-13 members,

456 Tren de Aragua members,

1,067 weapons,

More than $3,250,000 in currency,

Approximately 91 metric tons of narcotics.

In 2023, no habeas corpus cases related to alien detainees were filed, and in 2024, only one.

This spring, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump’s administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus for immigrant detainees, pointing to the “invasion” aspect of the clause.","As changes in the immigration court system create uncertainty for detainees, immigration attorneys are now turning to a 200-year-old American legal doctrine to get their clients released from detention facilities across the country.

That doctrine, known as a writ of habeas corpus, has typically been used as a last-ditch effort to give those behind bars a chance to present their case before a federal district judge and force the government to explain why a person’s detention is legal.

Now, attorneys are using it as a fast-pass ticket to seek a district court order that forces immigration judges to grant detainees a bond hearing or order their release.

“We have no choice. We have to file a habeas,” Constance Doyle, an Illinois-based attorney representing a recently released immigrant detainee, said in an interview with The Indiana Lawyer last week.

Without a habeas corpus filing, immigration courts now routinely deny bond hearings for detainees’ potential release.

“Things have changed a lot,” Doyle said.

How it works

The legal strategy worked for Doyle’s client, Jorge Garcia Ortiz.

After nearly two months in custody, he won a court order in late December releasing him from the Indiana Department of Correction’s Miami Correctional Facility, which has a contract with the federal government to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.

Ortiz was detained on Nov. 5 after the vehicle he was driving on I-90 near Rockford, Illinois, was struck by an ICE vehicle, according to his attorneys and court documents.

Once Ortiz’s vehicle was forced to the side of the road, ICE officers drew their weapons and broke Ortiz’s window to forcibly remove him from the vehicle.

Ortiz was detained and taken to Broadview, Illinois, to be processed. He was then transferred to Miami Correctional Facility near Peru, Indiana.

According to court documents, Ortiz, now 38 years old, came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2000. His attorneys say he has never left the U.S. since arriving here, and he now has five children—all U.S. citizens. Ortiz also has a minor criminal record, with a burglary conviction from more than 10 years ago.

In the past, most immigrants who entered the country without inspection and were later arrested by immigration authorities were typically eligible to request a bond hearing. The immigration judge had discretion to grant bond for release if the immigrant could show they were not a danger or a flight risk.

That practice changed last fall.

On Sep. 5, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or BIA, ruled in Matter of Yajure Hurtado that individuals who entered the U.S. without inspection are not eligible for a bond hearing before an immigration judge.

Much of the debate in that case, and in the pending federal cases, was based on the interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which details rules regarding the inspection, detention and removal of noncitizens.

Specifically, the discussion hinges on which noncitizens receive mandatory detention: those actively entering the country who have not been properly admitted or those who have been living in the country for a time who were not properly admitted.

In Hurtado, the BIA concluded that both categories of noncitizens warrant mandatory detention and are exempt from bond hearings.

In that case, Hurtado, who entered the U.S. without inspection, conceded that he is an “applicant for admission” under INA § 1225. Under that section, an applicant for admission is “an alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters).”

Hurtado also argued that because he lived inside the U.S. for almost three years, he cannot be considered as one “seeking admission,” a specific category of applicant for admission in § 1225 who “shall be detained.”

The BIA determined in its Sep. 5 ruling that Hurtado’s argument creates a “legal conundrum.”

“If he is not admitted to the United States (as he admits) but he is not ‘seeking admission’ (as he contends), then what is his legal status?” BIA stated. “The respondent provides no legal authority for the proposition that after some undefined period of time residing in the interior of the United States without lawful status, the INA provides that an applicant for admission is no longer ‘seeking admission,’ and has somehow converted to a status that renders him or her eligible for a bond hearing under section 236(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1226(a).”

Because of the BIA’s conclusions in Hurtado, when noncitizen detainees come before an immigration judge to consider bond hearings, the judge must deny jurisdiction in the matter. This means the detainee must remain in custody while their removal case proceeds.

Some federal district court judges in Indiana have consistently disagreed with the government’s stance and are overturning immigration judges’ rulings on denying bond hearings.

James Hanlon, a district court judge for the Southern District of Indiana, ruled in a recent habeas case that § 1225 applies to “arriving” noncitizens attempting to enter the country and not those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the interior of the U.S. for years.

He said the government’s interpretation of the statute “disregards” the plain meaning of § 1225 and is “inconsistent with decades of prior statutory interpretation and practice.”

A surge in filings

The BIA is an administrative body within the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review that reviews immigration judge decisions and determines precedent that is binding on all immigration judges—unless overruled by a federal court.

(The Executive Office for Immigration Review declined to comment on litigation-related matters for this story.)

The board shrank earlier this year from 28 to 15 members, following an April 2025 DOJ order. Nearly all of the board’s current members were appointed by conservative attorneys general. William Barr, President Donald Trump’s attorney general from his first administration, appointed five of the current members, and current Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed eight.

Since the BIA’s Hurtado ruling altered the course for many detainees, the country, and specifically Indiana, has seen a surge in habeas cases.

Although the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana declined to comment on the surge in habeas petitions, citing active and pending litigation, it did provide data detailing the number of petitions filed in the court over the last three years.

In 2023, no habeas corpus cases related to alien detainees were filed, and in 2024, only one. However, from Jan. 14, 2025, to Jan. 14, 2026, there were 93 cases filed.

An official with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana did not respond to requests for comment.

Nationally, information clearinghouse Habeas Dockets LLC reports more than 9,500 immigration-related habeas corpus filings are pending in federal district courts.

To Doyle, there is a clear reason why habeas filings are racking up now.

“We never had to do this before,” she said. “We didn’t even do habeas cases until this (Trump) administration took over.”

What is habeas corpus

Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “you should have the body.” In short, it means a judge must have any person who has been detained brought into the courtroom so that the legality of his or her detention can be reviewed.

A writ of habeas corpus, or a judicial order instructing law enforcement to produce a detainee, has been embedded in U.S. legal doctrine for over 200 years and is protected under the U.S. Constitution.

“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,” Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states.

This spring, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump’s administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus for immigrant detainees, pointing to the “invasion” aspect of the clause.

Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in the country, all of which were related to wartime; it was most recently suspended in Hawaii in 1941 by President Franklin Roosevelt, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The current administration has made no formal attempts to suspend the statute—which can only be done through congressional approval—so federal courts are reviewing these petitions and sometimes ordering immigration judges to allow detainees bond hearings or be released from custody.

Ongoing challenges

“All parties must play by the rules. The same wisdom that requires immigrants and noncitizens to follow the law equally requires the government to follow the law,” U.S. District Judge Damon Leichty of Northern Indiana wrote, in a Dec. 30, 2025, order granting Ortiz’s writ of habeas corpus and ordering his release from ICE custody.

Nearly two months after he was detained, Ortiz was released from the Miami Correctional Facility. But not every case moves at the same pace as his.

Vincent Olson, a lawyer in Doyle’s law office, said they had one client who was detained in Illinois at 9 a.m. and had filed a habeas petition in an Illinois federal court by 3 p.m. that afternoon.

But by that time, the client was already in transit, going through Iowa to Texas—one example of how difficult it is to track the whereabouts of some detainees.

“It’s been a little bit over a month, and we’re not even in the court yet,” Olson said. “So we’ve been trying to expedite the process by trying to do things as soon as they happen.”•",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-23 15:58:45.974793

How do other Minnesota county jails handle ICE?","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests in Minnesota and clashes between federal agents and residents.

But swirling beneath the surface of the tense, sometimes chaotic scenes playing out across the state is a political dispute over how local officials handle the cases of immigrants who are being held in state prisons and county jails.

Federal officials have suggested that they might wind down their campaign if Democratic leaders like Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey would give them access to the people subject to deportation in Minnesota’s prisons and jails.

“Let us in the damn jail,” Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, said recently. “Frey and Walz could fix this today.”

The Department of Homeland Security has asserted that Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey are shielding 1,360 immigrants charged with crimes who are subject to deportation, though it did not explain how it came to that conclusion. But state and local officials dispute the claim.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections said the number of incarcerated people that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified as being subject to deportation was slightly over 300 as of last Monday. The department also says the Trump administration is misrepresenting how Minnesota jails and prisons assist in immigration matters.

In Minnesota, officials say that state prisons have long released inmates subject to deportation to federal immigration officials after their sentences end. Mr. Frey has no authority over Minnesota’s county jails, which have a patchwork of policies on the issue. Some counties explicitly cooperate with federal authorities, and at least one, Hennepin, the state’s most populous county, refrains from assisting ICE agents as a matter of policy.

Nationally, the degree to which local law enforcement officials overseeing prisons and jails are willing to cooperate with immigration enforcement has long been a thorny issue.

Under Minnesota law, the state’s Department of Corrections must notify ICE officials when an immigrant convicted of a felony is set to be released. The agency, overseen by Governor Walz, says that it has long coordinated with ICE agents to transfer custody of those who are subject to deportation.

Last year, prison officials turned over to ICE 84 inmates who had finished sentences and were leaving the state prison system, according to the state agency.

Paul Schnell, the commissioner of the state’s Department of Corrections, said he and other state officials had struggled to get clear answers from the administration about the specific steps the White House would like them to take.

“We would certainly like to be in a place where we could offer things that may be useful and relevant and serve the interest of ICE,” Mr. Schnell said.

He said that some of the people federal officials have publicly highlighted as having been arrested during the crackdown were actually transferred directly from prisons with assistance from the state.

Does Minneapolis cooperate with ICE?

Minneapolis, the state’s largest city, has a policy barring municipal officials, including police officers, from asking residents about their immigration status, with rare exceptions. City officials said the policy was aimed at building trust between the police and immigrants.

“I recognize that the fear of deportation prevents some people from calling police in times of need or to report crime,” Chief Brian O’Hara of the Minneapolis police said in a statement explaining the policy.

Mayor Frey said that the city’s policy has no effect on inmates. “At the city level, we do not have authority over jails and prisons — period,” he said.

What about the jail in Minneapolis?

That partnership ended after Rich Stanek, a former Hennepin County sheriff who ran the jail for 12 years, was voted out of office in 2018. His successor, Dave Hutchinson, gradually ceased sharing information with ICE, meeting a campaign promise he had made.

Mr. Hutchinson contended that close cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE undermined public safety because it made undocumented immigrants reluctant to report crimes. Mr. Stanek maintained that his approach had kept dangerous criminals from being released from custody back onto the streets.

“Our job is to keep communities safe,” Mr. Stanek said. “That was, pure and simple, keeping communities safe.”

The newer policy — to refrain from cooperating with ICE — has continued since the 2022 election of the current sheriff, Dawanna Witt. Sheriff Witt declined a request for an interview.

How do other Minnesota county jails handle ICE?

Sheriffs in at least seven of Minnesota’s 87 counties have signed agreements to collaborate with ICE on immigration enforcement.

Under those partnerships, jail officials are trained to identify people who are in the country unlawfully and to share that information with federal agents to help facilitate deportations.

A few jails in the state have contracts providing beds for immigrants in ICE custody.

But most Minnesota sheriffs lack explicit policies on the issue, said Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who specializes in the intersection of criminal and immigration law. The extent to which jail officials help transfer people into ICE custody varies widely and relies mainly on individual relationships between local and federal officials.

“From my understanding, only a few sheriff offices even have a policy written down,” Mr. Chan said. “They like to have that flexibility.”

Why are some sheriffs reluctant to help ICE?

ICE routinely asks jail officials to notify the agency about the imminent release of a person subject to deportation by issuing a document known as a detainer. Detainers request that jail officials continue to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily be released.

Questions about the legal authority local officials have to detain people at the request of ICE have led to two lawsuits in the state in recent years.

Anoka County, a suburb of Minneapolis, was ordered to pay $30,000 in 2021 after a federal jury found that local officials had exceeded their authority when they detained a woman from Mexico for several hours after she was involved in a collision.

The following year, Nobles County agreed to pay a $200,000 settlement after a class-action lawsuit brought by individuals who accused the local sheriff of holding them unlawfully based on ICE requests.

“Sheriffs are generally worried about liability and wanting to follow the law,” said Sandra Feist, a Democratic state lawmaker who is also an immigration lawyer.

Still, several sheriffs say they regularly provide ICE with information about inmates the agency intends to take into custody. Some say ICE agents are not always available to pick up someone on short notice after an inmate has posted bail or been released by a judge for other reasons.

“Sometimes they don’t make it here on time,” Dakota County Sheriff Joseph Leko told a local news station this week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22nat-ice-detainers-fpzk/22nat-ice-detainers-fpzk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 18:58:40.207223
