In short:

DHS will temporarily detail FEMA human resources and security staff to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 90 days to support hiring 10,000 new officers.

The move affects about half of FEMA’s human resources team, which plays a key role in quickly bringing on local staff after disasters.

FEMA is already short roughly 2,000 workers due to federal workforce cuts and resignations tied to possible agency restructuring.

Key quote:

“Their deployment will NOT disrupt FEMA’s critical operations. FEMA remains fully prepared for Hurricane Season.”

— Department of Homeland Security statement

Why this matters:

Hurricane season’s peak months often bring the most destructive storms, requiring FEMA to mobilize quickly and on a large scale. Shifting staff away from disaster preparedness, even temporarily, could hinder the agency’s ability to respond to major emergencies. FEMA’s human resources teams are essential for rapidly hiring temporary workers to aid in disaster recovery, and security staff are vital for protecting both personnel and infrastructure during crises. With FEMA already operating at reduced staffing levels, any loss of capacity raises concerns about how effectively the federal government can respond if multiple severe weather events strike in quick succession.",https://assets.rbl.ms/61447564/origin.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 03:56:29.532432

In the first six months of the Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Houston arrested 356 illegal foreign nationals who are confirmed gang members.

Combined, they illegally entered the U.S. 1,434 times and were convicted of 1,685 criminal offenses, ICE said.

“Despite attempts by some to undermine the courageous work being done by our officers, the brave men and women of ICE continue to put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent transnational gang members, foreign fugitives and dangerous criminal aliens,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations-Houston acting Field Office Director Gabriel Martinez said. “In just the past couple of years in Houston, transnational gang members were responsible for brutally raping and murdering an innocent 12-year-old girl on her way to the store. Our officers know their efforts can help prevent atrocities like that from ever occurring again and they won’t rest until they’re all gone.”

Overall, ICE ERO-Houston officers arrested confirmed members of more than 40 gangs. The greatest number of gang arrests was 159 from the Paisas gang. The next greatest number was 39 confirmed MS-13 members and 25 Tren de Aragua members, which the Trump administration designated as foreign terrorist organizations. Other arrests were of confirmed Tango Blast, 15th Street Gang, Latin Kings and Surenos-13 gang members.

Of their combined 1,685 criminal convictions, offenses include abduction, homicide, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, promotion of child pornography, aggravated assault, domestic violence, burglary, alien smuggling, sex trafficking, organized crime, drug trafficking, drug possession, arson, trespassing, unlawful possession of a firearm, illegal entry, illegal reentry, fraud, escape and evading arrest, ICE said.

Of the worst offenders arrested that ICE highlighted, all are men and citizens of El Salvador and Mexico.

One Mexican national and confirmed Surenos-13 gang member, Jonathan Morales-Abundis, 30, was arrested after illegally entering the U.S. 29 times, ICE said. His illegal entries total nearly his age. Despite that, he was only convicted three times for illegal reentry and once for alien smuggling and illegal entry.

Another arrested Surenos-13 gang member was Juan Manuel Cayetano-Vasquez, 48, who illegally entered the U.S. 13 times, ICE said. His convictions include six for drug possession and three for resisting arrest; twice each for domestic violence, assault and identity theft; and once each for false imprisonment, illegal entry, illegal reentry, battery and destroying evidence, ICE said.

An arrested Latin Kings member and Mexican national, Luis Alberto Hernandez, 46, illegally entered the U.S. three times. His rap sheet, according to ICE, includes four convictions for domestic violence, three for illegal reentry, twice for aggravated assault, and once each for drug trafficking, unlawful possession of a firearm, obstructing police, disorderly conduct, drug possession, interfering with a 911 emergency call and child abuse.

Salvadoran nationals arrested include Milton Alexander Magana Fuentes, 31, a child predator and Paisas gang member who illegally entered the U.S. four times, ICE said. His convictions include sexual indecency with a child, failure to register as a sex offender, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Salvadoran MS-13 gang member arrests include Ronald Alberto Rivas-Aguilar, 28, who illegally entered twice and was convicted of homicide, and Jonathan Josue Valle-Moralez, 31, who was previously deported, ICE said. He was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm and in March was transferred into U.S. Marshals’ custody to be prosecuted for homicide.

ICE highlighted arrests of Mexican nationals and confirmed Paisas gang members including Luis Fernando Nava-Garcia, 20, who ICE said illegally entered the U.S. 40 times, more than twice the number of years he’s been alive. Yet, he was only convicted twice for illegal reentry.

Other confirmed Paisas gang members arrested include Javier Ivan Montoya-Avila, 34, who illegally entered 26 times. His convictions include burglary, tampering with government records, criminal trespass, illegal reentry and illegal entry, ICE said; Humberto Romero Avila, 45, who illegally entered 10 times. He was deported to Mexico where he was wanted for homicide, ICE said. His convictions include four DWIs, larceny, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Others Paisas gang member arrests include Jose Angel Martinez, 39, who illegally entered five times. His convictions include sexual indecency with a minor, aggravated assault of a family member, resisting arrest, burglary, drug possession and obstructing police, ICE said; Samuel Valenzuela Martinez, 55, who illegally entered the U.S. five times. His convictions include six DWIs, three convictions each for assault and illegal entry, and once each for hit-and-run, larceny, cruelty toward a child, evading arrest, fraud and illegal reentry, ICE said; Juan Pablo Hernandez Ramos, 35, a child predator who was deported three times. His convictions include possession with intent to promote child pornography, sexual assault, aggravated assault, illegal entry and illegal reentry, ICE said.

“The Trump Administration attempting to require advance notice for Members of Congress to do their jobs is against the law,” Crow told the Sentinel.
“Congress has the authority to make laws — and the law is clear: Members of Congress have the right to immediately access federal facilities to conduct oversight.
“It’s pretty clear this administration is erecting barriers to obstruct congressional oversight, which raises the very obvious question of, why and what are they hiding?","AURORA | Democratic Congressperson Jason Crow and three other members of Colorado’s Democratic House delegation said they will conduct an unannounced inspection tour Monday at the GEO-ICE detention center in Aurora, continuing Crow’s push for congressional oversight of the immigration jail.

The visit comes less than a week after Crow announced he is suing the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security unlawfully blocked him from entering the center in violation of a federal law allowing members of Congress to make unannounced inspections.

After Crow’s July 20 inspection attempt, spokespersons for Homeland Security’s ICE division said that the congressperson did not give a required seven-days notice before his visit, and so he was not admitted as a matter of department policy.

“In this case, the congressman’s request did not comply with the mandatory seven-day advance notice requirement,’ ICE officials said in a statement to the Sentinel. “DHS policy clearly requires requests to tour ICE detention facilities be submitted at least seven calendar days in advance for scheduling. This longstanding policy allows for the appropriate coordination necessary to protect facility operations.”

Crow, who represents Aurora and the 6th Congressional District, which includes the Aurora ICE jail, said in his July 30 lawsuit, that the ICE policy violates federal law.

“The Trump Administration attempting to require advance notice for Members of Congress to do their jobs is against the law,” Crow told the Sentinel. “Congress has the authority to make laws — and the law is clear: Members of Congress have the right to immediately access federal facilities to conduct oversight. Try as they might, the Administration cannot ignore the law.”

Crow said the obstanance shown by the Trump administration in Aurora and across the country is especially worrisome giving the troubling past at many of these immigrant holding facilities, especially the GEO facility in Aurora.

Crow’s congressional staff said he will be joined by Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen. The time of the inspection was not made public.

“It’s pretty clear this administration is erecting barriers to obstruct congressional oversight, which raises the very obvious question of, why and what are they hiding? What don’t they want people to know? What questions don’t want people to ask?” Crow said Wednesday. “It should worry everybody pretty deeply. It worries me, and it actually makes it even more important that we double down on our job and we get answers.”

Crow is joined in the lawsuit, filed in a DC federal court, by other congressional representatives who said they, too, were denied access to federal detention facilities. Others joining the lawsuit include representatives Joe Neguse, D-CO, Jamie Raskin, D-MD, Bennie Thompson D-MS, Veronica Escobar D-TX, Dan Goldman, D-NY, Adriano Espaillat, D-NY, Jimmy Gomez, D-CA, Norma Torres D-CA, Raul Ruiz, D-CA, Robert Garcia , D-CA, and Lou Correa, D-CA.

Since taking office in 2019, Crow has made oversight of immigration detention centers a signature issue, introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure members of Congress can make unannounced, in-person visits to such facilities.

He has inspected the Aurora center nine times, while his staff has conducted more than 70 additional inspections. Crow also publishes public reports on facility conditions, including health and treatment concerns.

The Aurora facility, operated by the private prison company GEO Group, has faced years of scrutiny from immigrant advocates who have been critical of alleged overcrowding, poor medical care and improper detainee treatment.

“Since President Trump was elected, this administration has denied Members of Congress access to immigration detention facilities and tried to intimidate us from doing our jobs,” Crow said previously “I will not be deterred from conducting lawful oversight, and I’ll continue fighting to hold the administration accountable, including in Congress and the courts.”",https://i0.wp.com/sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/AP17172779779224.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 02:56:49.127931

The authorization is the latest in Little’s efforts to support ICE activity in Idaho.

In June, Little announced that Idaho State Police will partner with ICE to help transport unauthorized immigrants who’ve been convicted of crimes to detention centers for deportation. The first ICE transports under the new partnership occurred Thursday, according to the governor’s office.

Immigration arrests and detentions in Idaho have risen steeply in 2025, the Idaho Capital Sun reported this week, increasing from 41 reported arrests by ICE agents in Idaho between January and June 2024 to 368 reported arrests during the same period this year.

In the Kootenai County jail, the number of border patrol holds has soared this year, though public records indicate that many individuals who have been booked into the county jail have not been convicted of any crime.

In years past, as few as two or three people a month were jailed in Kootenai County due to their immigration status. Local arrest numbers have increased as ICE has expanded its enforcement priorities in response to the Trump administration’s orders.

A total of 135 people were booked into the Kootenai County jail on a border patrol or immigration hold between Jan. 1 and May 20, according to public records, with more arrests occurring each week.

While 44 of those 135 people were contacted by law enforcement and arrested in North Idaho, mostly in Kootenai and Shoshone counties, the remaining two-thirds were arrested in Washington or Montana and transported to Kootenai County for holding.

People arrested on border patrol or immigration holds are typically held in the Kootenai County jail for a day or so before they’re transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, a privately run immigration prison operated on behalf of ICE.",https://hagadone.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/03/13/Little_Brad_r1200x630.jpg?b7d505e466ff31ef2a911eceee85296b69915698,N,,2025-08-11 03:56:43.747502

Ten hunger strikers wearing red wristbands were being entertained Sunday by supporters to keep their spirits up. There was no food here, but lots of hydration.

""We started Tuesday morning. Today, we're on day six,"" said immigration advocate Renee Saucedo.

Saucedo is taking part in the hunger strike, camping outside the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors offices. The group is urging supervisors to pass a sanctuary ordinance to protect local immigrant communities from federal ICE raids, which are happening in the North Bay and across the state.

""I'm so terrified. I carry my passport, because we've had people who are U.S. citizens being detained,"" said Naomi Lossy.

Lossy says conditions for the hunger strike haven't been ideal.

""Coconut water has been a lifesaver. We've been trying to stay cool in the shade as much as possible,"" Lossy said.

She brought her youngest son, 6-year-old Isaac, along for the drive.
When Shaw and Isaac attempted to re-enter the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained them at the border.
Although Shaw lacked a travel document, her son Isaac had one, according to Thorward.
Shaw asked Border Patrol agents to allow Besancon, the family friend, to pick up her son, but they refused.","SEATTLE — Sarah Shaw, a New Zealand national and mother of three, believed she had done everything right.

She had checked her documents, confirmed her visa status, and felt confident she could make a quick trip across the Canadian border to drop off her two older children at Vancouver International Airport for a flight to New Zealand, where they would visit their grandparents.

She brought her youngest son, 6-year-old Isaac, along for the drive. The crossing into Canada went smoothly. The return to Everett did not.

“I thought we had crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I,’” said Victoria Besancon, a close friend of Shaw. “Sarah had been waiting on some travel documents to be approved. But once her visa and her children’s visas were cleared, she felt comfortable taking them to Canada. We assumed everything was fine.”

That assumption proved wrong.

When Shaw and Isaac attempted to re-enter the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained them at the border.

“This was a simple administrative error,” said Shaw’s attorney, Minda Thorward. “Anyone could have made it.”

Shaw is in the process of applying for lawful permanent residency and holds what is known as a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that provides both work authorization and advance parole, which allows international travel and re-entry.

While her work authorization had been approved, her advance parole had not.

“Border Patrol had the discretion to parole her into the U.S.,” Thorward said. “I told her, yes, you don’t have a travel document, but you’ve only been gone about a day. Just explain what happened to the immigration officials.”

Shaw immigrated to the United States three and a half years ago under sponsorship from her then-husband. While divorce often jeopardizes a green card application, she qualified to reapply independently under provisions for survivors of domestic abuse.

She is now being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, one of only two facilities in the country that detain families facing deportation.

“Being treated like a criminal has been very embarrassing,” Besancon said. “One of the hardest parts for her has been her job finding out what was going on.”

Shaw works for the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and is a member of union Local 341. She serves at Echo Glen Children’s Center, a juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie.

“She’s a civil servant who works with some of the most at-risk youth in our community,” Besancon said. “She handles some of the hardest cases you can imagine.”

Thorward said Shaw remains eligible for a green card and believes that, in previous years, she likely would have been released quickly. But under the current presidential administration, she added, “anything’s possible.”

“With everything this administration has done, they’ve chosen cruelty intentionally — over and over,” she said.

Although Shaw lacked a travel document, her son Isaac had one, according to Thorward.

“There was absolutely no reason for him to be detained. It’s unconscionable,” she said.

Shaw asked Border Patrol agents to allow Besancon, the family friend, to pick up her son, but they refused.

“You never think it’s going to happen to you,” Besancon said. “The main thing Sarah has expressed throughout this ordeal is just absolute shock and devastation. She truly believed she had done everything that was required of her.”

Besancon created a GoFundMe to raise funds to pay her rent and legal representation in both Washington and Texas. According to the campaign, Shaw has depleted her savings while in detainment.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/cbb721a4-aa0c-48f4-be6e-e16506c0aaa9/20250811T014633/cbb721a4-aa0c-48f4-be6e-e16506c0aaa9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 22:57:04.793565

“We do see, though, in the courts that the Trump administration is trying to do away with limits on child detention. One of ICE’s only family detention facilities is in your district in Texas. And you did vote for the one ‘big, beautiful bill,'” CBS News’s Margaret Brennan said on “Face the Nation.”

“And it includes a provision that allows families with children to be held indefinitely, which contradicts that long-standing precedent of putting a 20-day limit on detaining children. Do you think that needs to be changed in future legislation? Should there be limits on detaining kids?” Brennan asked.

“Possibly. I mean, the legislative piece is a much more long road,” Gonzalez replied. “What I’ve seen under both the Biden administration and the Trump administration is that it’s … a delicate balance, right? How do you keep families together? How do you make sure that there — there is coordination to what — to what country they’re going to?”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration resumed family detention of immigrants, according to a legal nonprofit, rekindling a controversial practice mostly reduced under the Biden administration.

Ms Mahmood is also set to remove a requirement that means foreign criminals are only automatically considered for removal if they receive a 12-month prison sentence.
Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has also looked to outflank Sir Keir Starmer on border controls, saying the Tories would “deport all foreign criminals.
Under the Conservatives, foreign criminals served half of their sentence in our jails before being deported.
Foreign nationals who are given a prison sentence will automatically face deportation.","Foreign criminals who “abuse our hospitality” will be deported as soon as they are convicted, the Justice Secretary has said.

Shabana Mahmood will introduce new laws that mean migrants who are handed a prison sentence will automatically be removed from the UK immediately.

Writing for The Telegraph, she said she was “horrified” by the crimes of overseas nationals who must “lose their right to call our country home”.

However, critics said the measures were unlikely to work because foreigners would still be able to use human rights laws to thwart their deportation.

Ms Mahmood’s intervention comes amid controversy over crimes committed by some asylum seekers put up in taxpayer-funded hotels.

Last week, The Telegraph revealed that at least 200 people living in the hotels had been charged with a combined 425 offences this year.

That requirement is already scheduled to be cut to 30 per cent from September, and will be removed entirely from next year.

Ms Mahmood is also set to remove a requirement that means foreign criminals are only automatically considered for removal if they receive a 12-month prison sentence.

The Justice Secretary, who is the daughter of Pakistani immigrants, said she was “horrified by those who come to our country and commit crimes here”.

“When foreign nationals commit a serious crime, the appropriate punishment is clear to me: they must be sent packing,” she wrote.

“For too long, victims have watched on as those who harmed them not only completed their sentences here, but in many cases were then allowed to remain indefinitely, with many going on to re-offend.

“From now on, that will change. Foreign nationals who are given a prison sentence will automatically face deportation.”

There are currently more than 10,000 migrants in Britain’s prisons, their incarceration costing the taxpayer half a billion pounds every year.

This is despite a shortage of prison spaces, which has forced Ms Mahmood to release some dangerous criminals early to avert overcrowding.

She has sent teams into prisons to identify inmates for deportation, and has increased the rate of removals by 14 per cent compared with the last Tory government.

Labour is under growing pressure from Reform UK over immigration, particularly in its Red Wall seats.

Nigel Farage, the party’s leader, said the first thing he would do as Prime Minister would be to pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, has also looked to outflank Sir Keir Starmer on border controls, saying the Tories would “deport all foreign criminals. No ifs, no buts.”

The Home Office separately said it had abandoned plans to house asylum seekers in a town centre flat after protests led by Suella Braverman.

Officials told the former Tory home secretary that Clearsprings, a Home Office contractor, would no longer be seeking to “procure” a converted high-street clothes shop, which would have housed 35 asylum seekers.

The plan in Waterlooville, part of Mrs Braverman’s constituency in Hampshire, prompted more than 2,000 people to turn out at a high-street protest in July. More than 10,000 residents signed a petition opposing the scheme.

Barred for life

Ms Mahmood’s changes would mean all deported criminals would be barred from re-entering the UK for life.

People serving life sentences for murder would not be deported, nor would individuals who could pose a danger from abroad if they were released.

This would include terror suspects and could also cover criminals such as people-smugglers and drug kingpins who would look to ply their trade in the UK.

Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, is leading a review of how Article 8 of the convention, which guarantees the right to family life, is being interpreted by UK courts.

She is also looking at a number of cases where Article 3, against torture or inhumane and degrading treatment, has been enforced in deportation cases.

The Telegraph has revealed a string of cases where overseas criminals have used human rights laws to successfully fight against deportation.

In one case, a Nigerian conman who duped women out of almost £200,000 avoided removal because his wife and children were being treated by the NHS.

Foreign criminals forfeit their right to stay in Britain

By Shabana Mahmood

Like many who are born to immigrant parents, I am horrified by those who come to our country and commit crimes here. My parents came to Britain, from rural Kashmir, because they knew this was a nation where the law rules, above all else, and where crime will be punished. To be welcomed into this country, as my parents were, is to assume responsibilities as well as rights.

For that reason, when foreign nationals commit a serious crime, the appropriate punishment is clear to me: they must be sent packing. By failing to live up to their responsibilities, they must lose their right to call our country their home. They must be deported.

Unfortunately, this was not the situation I inherited in our prisons. On taking office, one in every eight prisoners was a foreign national, each housed in our prisons at considerable expense to the taxpayer.

Since the general election in July 2024, this Government has been deporting foreign national offenders in great numbers and at pace. In our first 12 months, we have deported almost 5,200 foreign criminals – a figure that is 14 per cent higher than the last Conservative government achieved in the previous year.

But I am clear that this is not enough. Under the Conservatives, foreign criminals served half of their sentence in our jails before being deported. I have already taken steps to lower that to 30 per cent and now I am going further still. As a result of the change that the Government is announcing on Sunday, foreign prisoners will soon face being deported from the very first day of their sentence. They will not only be made to leave; they will also be barred from returning to the UK.

The financial case is clear

These new powers will apply to those convicted in the future, so anyone who comes to Britain knows that complying with our laws is not optional, and failing to do so has consequences. These changes will also apply to those already serving sentences in our prisons, who will be removed from this country as quickly as possible. In fact, I have already deployed new, specialist removal teams to prisons across England and Wales. They are identifying foreign offenders right now, and working with the Home Office to remove them from our country.

The financial case for making this change is clear. The cost of keeping foreign national offenders in our jails is a staggering £500m every year. Taxpayers’ money can and must be better spent.

But this is not just about economics. It is about justice too. For too long, victims have watched on as those who harmed them not only completed their sentences here, but – in many cases – were then allowed to remain indefinitely, with many going on to reoffend. From now on, that will change. Foreign nationals who are given a prison sentence will automatically face deportation.

Our country has always welcomed those who come here legally, contribute to our society and make this country their home – just as my parents did when they arrived in the 1970s. But public confidence in our immigration system, and our justice system, demands that there are consequences whenever laws are broken. With the right to call this country home comes a responsibility to live by its rules. Now, thanks to this Government and our Plan for Change, those who come here and commit crimes know, without question, that they are no longer welcome here.

Cain, 59, revealed his plans on his personal X account and during several appearances on FOX News this week, stating he would soon be sworn in as an ICE agent to support former President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement initiatives.

Cain’s announcement immediately sparked backlash from Hollywood figures. Emmy-winning actor John Leguizamo called Cain a “moron” and a “has/been,” criticizing his decision to support ICE given his Japanese American heritage. Comedian Margaret Cho and “Glee” star Kevin McHale also expressed disapproval, with McHale dismissing the move as a desperate publicity stunt.

Cho also specifically pointed out Cain’s own immigrant heritage. Cain is half-Japanese on his father’s side, his birth name being Dean Tanaka. In a previous interview with Variety, Cain explained that he’s proud of his Japanese lineage and family, even showing off a tattoo on his ankle that he says honors them.

Other celebrities commented or lauded these more public response in their comments, like Academy Award winning actor Tatum O’Neal responding with six clapping emojis and director Lee Daniels with a simple laughing comment. Actor Frank Grillo, who played Rick Flag Sr. in the 2025 Superman movie, responded to Leguizamo calling Cain a “has been” and instead calling Cain a “never was.”

ICE’s recruitment policies now add context to Cain’s move. The agency recently removed upper age limits, allowing applicants as young as 18 and without an age cap, aiming to fill staffing shortages. To attract recruits, ICE is offering up to $50,000 in signing bonuses, student loan forgiveness, and enhanced retirement benefits. Social media for the Department of Homeland Security, the department that oversees ICE, is packed with recruitment posts, evoking old “Uncle Sam” and World War II style artwork.

Yet despite these incentives, critics highlight a glaring gender gap. Female agents remain severely underrepresented, raising concerns about inclusivity in the agency’s ranks. None of the recent marketing for the job have included any female personnel. Instead, every official government poster and ad for recruitment are (as of today) all white men or caricatures of white historic American propaganda.

Cain himself has a background in law enforcement, having served as a reserve police officer in Idaho and Virginia. He has been an outspoken supporter of Trump’s immigration policies and has openly criticized the “woke” reinterpretations of Superman in recent media. His decision to join ICE reflects a personal commitment to the former president’s agenda on immigration enforcement.

This development highlights how often celebrities influence political debates, often provoking polarized reactions and magnifying contentious issues like immigration.

The updated agreement represents another attack on immigrants in the county.

The mobilization was called for by Orlando Against Police Crimes, after Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings caved in to threats from Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.

Protesters gathered near the busy downtown street and chanted “No camps, no hate, no ICE in our state!” while holding signs in support of immigrant rights before moving in front of the commission building for speeches.

Several organizations mobilized alongside Orlando Against Police Crimes, including Orlando 50501, Orlando for Peace, and Orlando 50501 Latinos. State Representative Anna Eskamani delivered a speech in solidarity.

“We aren't going to let Ron DeSantis and his cronies bully our town into doing Donald Trump's bidding. We aren't going to allow our resources to be used to ship our brothers and sisters to the concentration camp in the Everglades. And we'll keep fighting until all of these inhumane black sites are shut down for good,” said Cassia Laham, an organizer with Orlando Against Police Crimes and the event’s emcee.

Just a few weeks before, the Orange County commission voted unanimously to not sign an addendum to the county’s 287(g) contract with ICE. This addendum would have county correctional officers responsible for transportation of immigration detainees to facilities such as the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” concentration camp in the Everglades, which is known for its inhumane conditions and human rights abuses. The commission also decided on renegotiating its Intergovernmental Service Agreement, or IGSA contract with the U.S. Marshals Service which allowed the county jail to house detainees from other localities before their transfer to another facility. A local group called the Immigrants Are Welcome Here Coalition played a leading role in those victories for the immigrant community.

In response, DeSantis and Uthmeier launched a slew of attacks against Mayor Demings and the rest of the commission. In a letter to the county commission, Uthmeier stated, “Florida law forbids sanctuary policies and requires locals to use ‘best efforts’ to assist with immigration enforcement.” DeSantis then threatened to remove Demings and other commissioners if they did not sign the addendum to allow transportation of immigration detainees.

Shortly after stating that he would not be bullied into compliance by DeSantis and his cronies, Mayor Demings signed the addendum on Friday, August 1 and set for it to be voted on and ratified at Tuesday, August 5, county commission meeting.

At the meeting on Tuesday, the reactionary addendum was ratified with a 5 to 2 vote. Commissioners Kelly Semrad and Nicole WIlson were the only two that voted against it. Despite this setback, the local movement for immigrant rights will continue to fight back against any and all attacks on the immigrant community.

Frustrated with the mayor’s backtracking, Jacob Muldoon, a UPS Teamster and member of Freedom Road Socialist Organization said “Mayor Demings, shame on you for betraying our county. You made a commitment and put your own political career over the livelihoods of immigrants in Orange County.”",https://i.snap.as/oj6nREsP.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 14:56:34.334663

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said: This Government is taking radical action to deport foreign criminals, as part of our Plan for Change.
Foreign offenders make up around 12% percent of the total prison population with prison places costing £54,000 a year on average.
The measures will apply to all foreign national offenders already in custody as well as those newly sentenced, ensuring that taxpayers’ money will not be wasted on incarcerating foreign criminals in the future.
The changes to enable the immediate deportation of foreign prisoners require primary legislation and will be brought before Parliament in due course.","The new power announced today (10 August) will get foreign national offenders out of our prisons, saving money for British taxpayers and protecting the public from dangerous criminals.

The change follows legislation introduced by the Government in June, which will mean most foreign prisoners can now be deported after serving 30 percent of their prison time, rather than 50 percent.

Today, the Government has announced it will go even further—stripping back a decades-old law to introduce new powers for immediate deportation from prison. Offenders who are deported are barred from re-entering the UK, keeping their victims and the wider public safe. Terrorists, murderers and others serving life sentences will continue to have to serve their prison sentence before being considered for deportation.

Ramping up removals of foreign national offenders has been a priority for this Government with almost 5,200 deported since July 2024 – an increase of 14% compared to the same 12 months prior. We have also invested £5 million for the deployment of specialist staff to almost 80 jails with one clear mission – speeding up removals. These are all now in post.

This is part of our Plan for Change to fix the broken criminal justice system we inherited and make our streets safer. This includes building 14,000 more prison places, reforming sentencing and ensuring victims get the support they need.

Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said:

This Government is taking radical action to deport foreign criminals, as part of our Plan for Change. Deportations are up under this Government, and with this new law they will happen earlier than ever before.

Our message is clear: if you abuse our hospitality and break our laws, we will send you packing.

These measures build on broader work during the Government’s first year in office to deliver on the British public’s priorities for border security and ramp up returns which has now seen 35,000 people with no right to be here returned since the election, including over 5,000 FNOs.

The changes will apply to prisoners serving fixed-term, or determinate, sentences and discretion to not use the measure on a case-by-case basis will be retained. For example, where there is clear evidence a prisoner is planning further crimes against UK interests such as posing a threat to national security they will not be released.

Foreign offenders make up around 12% percent of the total prison population with prison places costing £54,000 a year on average.

The measures will apply to all foreign national offenders already in custody as well as those newly sentenced, ensuring that taxpayers’ money will not be wasted on incarcerating foreign criminals in the future.

We are committed to further ramping up returns activity, including exploring returns hubs, introducing a ground-breaking new returns treaty with France which will see small boat arrivals detained and returned to France, and will set out major reforms to the asylum appeals system later this year, working with a range of countries to strengthen law enforcement, border security and returns.

Our Immigration White Paper will end the addiction to cheap overseas labour that saw net migration explode to nearly one million in recent years by replacing it with an immigration system that is controlled, selective and fair and boosting opportunities for homegrown talent. The White Paper also includes plans to introduce legislation that tightens the application of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and sets out reforms to make it easier to remove foreign criminals convicted of any offence before the threat they pose escalates.

The changes to enable the immediate deportation of foreign prisoners require primary legislation and will be brought before Parliament in due course.

Further information

In May, the Independent Sentencing Review recommended the law change so most foreign prisoners could be deported after serving 30 percent of their prison time, rather than 50 percent, and up to four years before their release, rather than the current 18 months.

The Government laid secondary legislation in June and this is expected to come into force in September, at which point prisoners with no right to be in the country will face deportation 30% into their prison part of their sentence rather than the current 50%.

This will be reduced to 0% once the primary legislation this power requires is in force.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a37db21ed915d5a62fdc762/s960_ministry-of-justice.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 15:56:20.031398

Holder and Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that gender is an “innate characteristic” that is “fundamental to [one’s] identity.” In two cases, the European Union Court of Justice found that Afghan women, as women, are subject to persecution.
Because “membership in a particular social group” is so open to interpretation — including very narrow interpretations like the Board’s — the challenge to Congress should be raised.
But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.
Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group.","In a recent decision denying asylum to a Salvadoran woman being stalked by gang members, the Board of Immigration Appeals — the highest administrative body for interpreting U.S. immigration law — found that under U.S. law, her claim that Salvadoran women constitute a group of people at risk of persecution was “overbroad and insufficiently particular to be cognizable.”

The foundation of refugee law — both internationally and in the U.S. — is that asylum should be provided to a person with a well-founded fear of being persecuted on any of five grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or “membership in a particular social group.” This last category is intended to protect people similarly exposed to persecution as the other four groups because of immutable characteristics that cannot be changed or beliefs so fundamental they should not be required to change them.

There are precedents in both U.S. and international law for treating women as a “particular social group.” In Perdomo v. Holder and Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that gender is an “innate characteristic” that is “fundamental to [one’s] identity.” In two cases, the European Union Court of Justice found that Afghan women, as women, are subject to persecution.

But in denying this woman’s claim, the Board said, “If we held that groups defined solely by sex were cognizable, we would essentially create another protected ground under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] — that of sex — to add to the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” That, it said, would be a job for Congress.

Because “membership in a particular social group” is so open to interpretation — including very narrow interpretations like the Board’s — the challenge to Congress should be raised.

What is the logic in saying that individuals should be denied asylum because the persecuted group they are a part of is too large? In a country where any group of people is widely persecuted, it shouldn’t matter whether that group is large or small to decide whether one of its members needs protection. All that should matter is the likelihood of the risk that person faces and the severity of the threat to them or of the abuse they have experienced.

Of course, being a woman per se is not grounds for asylum, any more than being a member of any race, nationality or religion. But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.

Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group. In the landmark Fauzia Kasinga case, a woman fleeing genital mutilation was granted asylum not based on her right not to be persecuted on the basis of her gender, but rather as a member of a particular social group, defined as “young women who are members of the Tchamba-Kasungu Tribe of northern Togo who have not been subjected to female genital mutilation, as practiced by that tribe, and who oppose the practice.” A more narrowly defined group is hardly conceivable.

Often, though, the compulsion to particularize can distort the reality of persecution. Consider women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. All Afghan girls are barred from education beyond the sixth grade. No woman is allowed to attend university and all face severe restrictions on employment. A woman is not allowed to walk outside her home unless accompanied by a male relative, limiting access to public spaces and services, including access to health care. Violations of the hijab dress code and other draconian rules are met with severe punishment.

In September 2024, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan said the “Taliban’s institutionalized system of…gender persecution…impacts almost the entire population.”

When Congress next looks at U.S. immigration law, it should question why women should have to shoehorn their claims into a narrow understanding of membership of a particular social group and thereby have less consistent or predictable protection than racial, religious, nationality and political groups. In light of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ narrow reading of existing law, Congress should amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to add gender as an unequivocally protected ground of the refugee definition standing alongside race, religion, nationality and political opinion.

Democrats also plan to campaign on what the bill does not do.
The group has named 26 House districts where it believes Republicans can win, while its adversary, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), is targeting 35 seats.
Democrats see reasons to believe their strategy of campaigning against the bill is sound.
“I think Democrats are way out of over their skis, thinking that that alone will get them to the promised land next year.”","Earlier this summer, Republican lawmakers gathered around Donald Trump and applauded as he sat before a desk outside the White House and put his signature on what he calls his “one, big, beautiful bill”.

But there were few claps for Mike Flood this week when the Republican congressman appeared before an auditorium of his Nebraska constituents to extol the tax and spending legislation’s benefits – just boos and jeers.

“From where I sit, there’s been a lot of misinformation out there about the bill,” Flood said, as the audience – some of whom had been encouraged to attend by local Democrats – howled.

“If you are able to work, and you’re able-bodied, you have to work. If you choose not to work, you do not get free healthcare,” Flood later said, diving into the bill’s controversial imposition of work requirements for many enrollees of Medicaid, the healthcare program for poor and disabled Americans. The heckling only intensified.

Trump’s bill is looming large over senators and representative of both parties as they disperse across the country for Congress’s August recess. Signed by Trump on the Fourth of July holiday, the sprawling piece of legislation extends lower tax rates enacted during his first term, creates new exemptions aimed at working-class voters, and funds his plans for mass deportations of immigrants.

Republicans see it as the epitome of the president’s “promises made, promises kept” mantra, while for Democrats, it presents an opportunity to return from the political wilderness voters banished them to in last year’s elections.

Central to their pitch is the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs, its enactment of tax provisions from which the wealthy are expected to see the most benefit, and its overall price tag, which is expected to rise to $3.4tn over the next 10 years.

Democrats also plan to campaign on what the bill does not do. The Republicans who wrote it declined to use the opportunity to extend subsidies for premiums paid by people who receive insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) – meaning millions of Americans may find healthcare unaffordable when they expire at the end of the year.

“Between the Medicaid cuts and the ACA cuts, our hospitals are looking at a real phenomenon of people walking into their ERs with no insurance,” the Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin said this week during a town hall in Michigan – a state Trump won last year.

“When you get that letter, when it arrives in your post box, I want you to understand that that increase to your private insurance is because of the cuts that Donald Trump has decided to make just in the past month here, OK. There is a cause and effect.”

Republicans, only a handful of whom have held town halls since the recess began, argue that it is Democrats who will be facing tough questions back home for their unanimous rejection of the bill. Voters will be won over by the legislation’s tax relief for tips, overtime and interest on American cars, larger deductions for taxpayers aged 65 and up, and expansion of immigration enforcement, the party believes, while Medicaid and Snap will ultimately benefit because the measure, they claim, weeds out “waste, fraud and abuse” through stricter work requirements and eligibility checks.

“Republicans are putting working-class Americans first. The one big beautiful bill set that image in concrete for the 2026 midterms, putting Republicans on offense and giving voters a clear, commonsense contrast,” the National Republican Congressional Committee said in a memo. The group has named 26 House districts where it believes Republicans can win, while its adversary, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), is targeting 35 seats.

The main battle next year will be for control of the House of Representatives, which the GOP controls by a margin that is expected to shrink to just three seats once recently created vacancies are filled.

Democrats see reasons to believe their strategy of campaigning against the bill is sound. Recent polls from KFF and Quinnipiac University show that the legislation is unpopular, while Trump is seeing his own approval ratings slump. The GOP is also grappling from the messy fallout caused by Trump supporters’ demands for the release of files related to the sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Yet some in the party say making their case will be tricky because of how the measure is written. While it mandates the largest cuts in history to Medicaid and to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), those mostly go into effect only after election day next year.

“Mission number one for us as Democrats is to be educating voters on the actual impacts of the bill and continuing to call out the Republicans that if it was so important to make these cuts to Medicaid and other programs that are happening basically in two years, why aren’t they doing it now? Why don’t they make it now?” said Jane Kleeb, a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the party’s leader in Nebraska, where the House seat around Omaha is expected to be the site of a fervid race to replace the retiring Republican Don Bacon.

“We all know the answer, right, because they want to win some of these races in ’26.”

Brian Jackson, the Democratic party chair in Ingham county, Michigan, said he was not concerned about the bill’s timing undermining their case against Tom Barrett, a first-term Republican congressman. In an interview, he described an atmosphere of uncertainty in the swing district created by the looming benefit cuts, Trump’s tariffs and his administration’s freeze of research funding, which has affected the local Michigan State University.

“The concern goes back to the overall culture of fear and unknown, and that just is horrible for the economy, it’s horrible for jobs, the auto industry. So, you know, Medicaid is just one of many symptoms of an out-of-touch Washington and how it impacts people’s day-to-day lives,” he said.

In California’s Kern county, Democrats are gearing up for a campaign against David Valadao, a Republican congressman and resilient opponent whose district has one of the highest rates of Medicaid enrollment in the nation. Though he voted for Trump’s bill after giving mixed messages about its cuts to Medicaid, the local Democratic party chair, Christian Romo, warned that their delayed impact could frustrate the party’s efforts.

“This is going to devastate this community,” Romo said. But with the provisions not taking effect until after the election, “will people actually feel the implications of that? No. So will they remember that Valadao voted yes on that bill? You know, it’s up in the air, and we’ll have to see.”

Top congressional Democrats argue that even if the cuts themselves are delayed, voters will feel their disruptions coming.

“Companies are making decisions because they know there’s going to be less revenue as a result of a trillion dollars in cuts to Medicaid, the largest Medicaid cut in history of this country,” said Pete Aguilar, the House Democratic caucus chair.

“So, healthcare premiums will rise, that will happen early, insurers will make these decisions as well, and hospitals are going to have to face difficult decisions on what their future looks like.”

Christopher Nicholas, a veteran Republican political consultant based in Pennsylvania, where the DCCC is looking to oust four Republicans, warned that Democrats can’t count on just the Medicaid cuts to get them back to the majority.

“As America continues to stratify, self-select into separate neighborhoods and communities, you’re going to have a lot of those represented by Republicans that don’t have as much exposure to the Medicaid program, and you’re going to have lots of them represented by Democrats in more urban areas that have more exposure to the Medicaid program,” he said.

They made 16 arrests. It’s an example of the fastest-growing method for the Department of Homeland Security to juice its mass deportation machine: illegal profiling.

In a new analysis of DHS immigration arrest data for the Cato Institute, I document the shocking number of Latin American immigrants being arrested on the streets with no criminal convictions, no criminal charges and no deportation orders. Nothing that would have put them on the radar of DHS for removal. No reason to seek them out specifically.

In June, one in five DHS immigration arrests targeted a Latino on the streets who had no criminal past nor a removal order against them.

The data was obtained from ICE via a Freedom of Information Act request by the Deportation Data Project — a nonpartisan project headed by a law professor at Berkeley. It gives detailed information on each person arrested by DHS as of June 26. It shows DHS took down 15,000 people on the streets without any criminal history or removal orders since Inauguration Day.

But in June alone, the figure was 7,000 — 90% were Latin American immigrants. There was a jump in these arrests immediately in January, but the recent shift has taken the operation to a whole new level. In June, one in five DHS immigration arrests targeted a Latino on the streets who had no criminal past nor a removal order against them.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email, “This data is being cherry picked by the Deportation Data Project to peddle a false narrative,” adding: “Any claims that individuals have been ‘targeted’ by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE. What makes someone a target of ICE is that they are in our country illegally — not their skin color. DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence.”

However, we already know that agents are stopping people before they know they’re in the country illegally.

ICE officials told The Wall Street Journal that in mid-May the White House ordered them to stop “develop[ing] target lists of immigrants” and just “go out on the streets” and make arrests right away. The ICE officials told the Washington Examiner they were asked by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, “What do you mean you’re going after criminals? Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?”

Since the White House marching orders, street arrests of people with no criminal history or removal order spiked threefold to over 1,500 per week.

We can’t know whether there was probable cause for these arrests in every case, but we do know the administration uses sweepingly broad profiling categories because its representatives already told us it does. Deportation czar Tom Homan told Fox News that agents will detain people “based on the location, their occupation, their physical appearance, their actions like … they walk away.”

DHS describes these interactions as “consensual.” But they are anything but. As a California district court put it, “When individuals have tried to avoid an encounter with agents and officers, they have been followed and pushed to the ground, sometimes even beaten, and then taken away.”

Since the White House marching orders, street arrests of people with no criminal history or removal order spiked threefold to over 1,500 per week.

In one case, DHS agents pepper-sprayed, tackled and brutally beat a landscaper in Los Angeles after they profiled him outside an IHOP, and — according to DHS — he “refused to answer questions” and tried to leave. After they discovered he was a father of three U.S. Marines, they released him. In another case, agents jumped from a car to arrest a random Latino man on the street who asserted in English, “I have the right to remain silent.”

The one thing that the DHS data does not record: how many times DHS illegally profiles U.S. citizens and legal residents.

Fox News watched agents go “house to house” in a Florida housing development site demanding to see proof of immigration status from workers. The outlet reported agents interrogated 361 workers and arrested just 33. In other words, the number of legal residents being targeted vastly exceeded those who were not legal.

These aren’t simply harmless errors. Border Patrol agents shoved Jason Brian Gavidia against a fence when he told them he was a citizen, demanding to know the hospital where he was born. After agents smashed his car window, U.S. citizen and U.S. veteran George Retes was pepper-sprayed, dragged from his vehicle and detained by ICE for three days without charge, as the AP reported.

ICE agents tackled a 32-year-old U.S. citizen, Andrea Velez, on her way to work. After they learned she was a citizen, they charged her with impeding their efforts to chase down other people to determine “whether they were lawfully present.” In other words, their defense against charges of illegal profiling was: We were profiling someone else! The charges against Velez were dismissed, according to The Guardian.

These tactics are causing chaos in the streets. Bystanders think these arrests could be kidnappings when masked agents don’t identify themselves. A U.S. citizen was pepper-sprayed and arrested trying to stop Velez’s illegal arrest. Surgical center employees were arrested for demanding a warrant from an agent to enter their property to arrest a landscaper whose immigration status he admitted he didn’t know in his affidavit.

All this chaos is also illegal. In fact, it is even blocked by a district court order that was upheld on appeal just this week. The appeals court reaffirmed prior rulings that have found it is unconstitutional to stop or detain people based on broad characteristics that would “cast suspicion on large segments of the law-abiding population.” It said this included not just race, but also language ability, occupation and location, such as Home Depot.

Not only that, under Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, immigration agents don’t even have the authority to interrogate someone without a warrant or reason to believe that the person is a noncitizen. Demanding people prove their right to be in the United States isn’t legal. Whether you’re a citizen or not, you have every right to say: Go away.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250808-ICE-Home-Depot-aa-206-62de2e.jpg",N,,2025-08-10 12:59:44.529818

Newsweek reached out to the White House and U.S. Treasury outside of normal business hours on Saturday afternoon for comment.

Why It Matters

The IRS has suffered significant cutbacks in personnel through the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which experts warned could hamper core tax administration functions.

The push by Trump and Elon Musk, who led DOGE before leaving the White House in May, drew widespread condemnation over the administration's slash-and-burn approach to shrinking the bureaucracy.

Mass layoffs and removals at the IRS have also raised concerns about its ability to process tax returns and refunds.

Long's removal comes less than two months after he was confirmed to lead the IRS. According to the Associated Press, he will be the shortest-tenured IRS commissioner confirmed by the Senate since the position was created in 1862.

What To Know

The Post, citing two people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, reported that Long's dismissal followed a disagreement between members of the IRS and the administration after the previously agreed method of data sharing yielded an unsatisfying number of confirmed targets for immigration enforcement.

The Trump administration has previously attempted to access sensitive, confidential data as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration. IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause stepped down for her position in April after refusing to allow immigration enforcement access to taxpayer data, and a federal judge shortly thereafter refused to stop the IRS from sharing immigrant tax information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The deal, agreed to in April, permitted ICE to submit names and addresses of suspected undocumented immigrants to the IRS, which then cross-checks the data against tax filings. Tax information is typically considered confidential and punishable by criminal penalties if improperly shared.

According to the newspaper, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently asked the IRS to locate roughly 40,000 immigrants using their addresses cross-referenced with taxpayer information, but the service only managed to verify about 3 percent of the names submitted.

The people verified had individual taxpayer identification numbers, and White House officials determined this was insufficient and requested information beyond the previously agreed parameters.

Specifically, the administration wanted to know if the people in question had claimed income tax credit, which can reduce the tax bill for low-income filers.

The IRS declined to provide this information, citing taxpayer privacy rights, according to the Post, which Long had previously stated he would not provide due to falling outside the previously agreed parameters.

Trump thereafter removed Long, a former six-term Republican congressman from Missouri, from his post on Friday, making him the ambassador to Iceland and temporarily replacing him with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, marking the fifth change in leadership at the IRS since Trump returned to office in January.

What People Are Saying

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Washington Post in a statement: ""The Trump administration is working in lockstep to eliminate information silos and to prevent illegal aliens from taking advantage of benefits meant for hardworking American taxpayers. Any absurd assertion other than everyone being aligned on the mission is simply false and totally fake news.""

Former IRS Commissioner Billy Long posted on X on Friday: ""It is a honor to serve my friend President Trump and I am excited to take on my new role as the ambassador to Iceland. I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda. Exciting times ahead!""

What Happens Next?

Bessent will serve as acting IRS commissioner while the administration considers a permanent successor, leaving the agency again under interim leadership as it addresses operational strains tied to layoffs and program changes.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699734/irs-commissioner-billy-long-dismissed.png,N,,2025-08-10 11:56:36.442376

Now some are told to start over - NPR,Ximena Bustillo,,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/08/10/nx-s1-5487598/asylum-seekers,"Now it appears that the new Trump administration is dismissing applications, effectively making people start over on a process they began years ago.
Per USCIS' process, the credible fear interview is key to pulling someone out of expedited removal prior to filing for asylum.
""The credible fear [interview] is considered a screening tool.
In some letters, applicants are told to await a notice from ICE about when their credible fear interview will be scheduled.
""Once he was released, they did schedule a credible fear interview, but [it] was canceled.","The Trump administration is stripping protections of some asylum applicants who filed as far back as 2019.

NPR has learned that dozens of immigrants across the U.S. have received letters in the mail notifying them that their asylum cases have been dismissed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a branch of the Department of Homeland Security.

The reason, according to the letters: These asylum-seekers, many of whom entered between 2019 and 2022, did not receive a mandatory screening, known as a ""credible fear"" interview, at the border.

The interview is conducted by an asylum officer once someone has been detained or has arrived in the United States. It is meant as an opportunity for a person to describe any fear of persecution they may face if they are returned to their home country.

The U.S. didn't have enough asylum officers to do credible fear interviews for every person crossing the border, given the huge influx of border-crossers starting with the COVID-19 pandemic, at the end of the first Trump administration and during the Biden administration, experts told NPR. Now it appears that the new Trump administration is dismissing applications, effectively making people start over on a process they began years ago.

This round of asylum case dismissals is the latest effort by the Trump administration to strip protections from those who have been in the U.S. for years. In the past few months, the administration has limited the ways in which people can seek asylum, has made the process more expensive and is now reviewing already filed claims and dismissing them if parts of the complex application are missing. But as officials expand the scope of whom they are arresting, detaining and deporting, lawyers fear their clients who have been waiting years for their asylum interviews may get caught up in the effort to conduct mass deportations.

Asylum is a form of protection granted to those who either have already entered the U.S. or are at a port of entry, having left their home country. After an application is filed, applicants receive work permits, pay taxes and can enroll in school.

""You're literally making documented people, again, undocumented, and they're already in here,"" said Michelle Marty Rivera, an immigration attorney who has dozens of clients who have received these letters. ""You are canceling employment authorization. You're virtually converting people that are following the normal traditional asylum rules and leaving them without a status and without protection and asking them to show their faces to ICE.""

Lawyers told NPR that in some cases, their clients may have been marked for ""expedited removal"" when they first entered the country. That is a form of deportation for people who have been in the U.S. for less than two years.

When asked about the asylum application dismissals, USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said that if upon reviewing an application, USCIS discovers that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection designated a person as in ""expedited removal,"" USCIS administratively closes the application due to a lack of jurisdiction.

""This is a long-standing practice that is not new,"" Tragesser said. Per USCIS' process, the credible fear interview is key to pulling someone out of expedited removal prior to filing for asylum.

""The credible fear [interview] is considered a screening tool. And essentially there's a higher standard that when someone achieves that, then they can then go through the asylum process,"" said Morgan Bailey, a former USCIS official who served under both Trump and Biden, adding that for the last 15 years, the agency has not been able to keep up with the number of asylum-seekers who need credible fear interviews. ""There aren't enough asylum officers to cover the workload, but there has also been such an increase in the number of asylum applications.""

But now, immigration attorneys are warning that immigrants are facing the consequences of that shortage.

Asylum-seekers are bounced around the system

There are different versions of the letters that asylum applicants received, and NPR has reviewed some of them. Applicants began receiving them in July. The letters say that all processing of their asylum application is terminated. In some letters, applicants are told to await a notice from ICE about when their credible fear interview will be scheduled. In others, the letters tell them to report to ICE first and request the interview. Some are not clear on next steps.

Attorney Maria Florencia Garcia has one client who entered through the southern border and was originally put into expedited removal but was released into the U.S. before he received his interview.

""Once he was released, they did schedule a credible fear interview, but [it] was canceled. We tried to get a reschedule for a couple of years. It never happened,"" Florencia Garcia said, adding that they applied for asylum anyway because that must be filed within a year of being in the country. But in recent weeks, that client got the letter notifying them of the dismissal.

""He's unable to work. He's not going to be able to renew his employment authorization card,"" Florencia Garcia said. ""The only way that he's going to be able to proceed is by showing up to ICE, telling them that he has a fear of return, and that will likely get him detained.""

Arno Lemus, another immigration attorney, sees this effort from the second Trump administration as an attempt to reclassify a certain set of asylum applicants who primarily came in during the Biden years.

""They're just doing the process that was allotted to them that was legal and provided to them the moment that they presented themselves in the U.S.,"" Lemus said, noting that some of his clients have also received the letters. ""And now the government's wanting to retroactively go back.""

Lemus agrees with USCIS that the policy is not necessarily new — the credible fear interviews are the prerequisite to filing for asylum. But like other attorneys, Lemus said he has clients who have been waiting for upwards of six years for their asylum case to be reviewed.

""The issue is that people were already released into the U.S. They've already established years of processing. They've paid taxes. They've got jobs. Some of them have made investments in the U.S.,"" Lemus said.

Risk of detention is higher than in the past

The Trump administration this summer unveiled a new policy requiring immigrants who entered the country illegally to be put in detention without an opportunity for release while they fight their cases.

Immigration lawyers told NPR that they are concerned that their clients, who were awaiting their asylum interviews, will get detained if they report to ICE to schedule their credible fear interviews.

""There's a lack of trust. There's a lot of uncertainty that makes people afraid. It makes people not want to fight their cases, whether they're strong or not,"" said Florencia Garcia. ""They just don't want to risk it.""

ICE has increased the number of arrests at immigration courts, and high-profile worksite enforcement operations have left many afraid.

""You go to court — you get detained; you go to your ICE appointment — you get detained; you go to work — you get detained; you apply for asylum — you were processed incorrectly,"" Lemus said. ""You just can't do anything.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6851x3854+0+261/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F77%2F73%2F46b73641407baff006f70be10b9e%2Fgettyimages-2194449149.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 11:57:06.256976

Mark Kelly said his recent meetings with two women detained at the Eloy immigration detention center underscore the flaws of the Trump administration’s campaign to arrest as many immigrants as possible, regardless of whether they pose any threat.

“By any reasonable measure, they should not be in a prison, and I think that’s true for probably most of the people in there,” Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said in a telephone interview with the Arizona Daily Star on Thursday afternoon, following his visit to Eloy in Pinal County. “Under a normal functioning government, you wouldn’t be locking these folks up.”

Kelly met with a grandmother named Maria Pelaez, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and has no criminal record, he said. Pelaez, a New Jersey resident, was detained as she entered the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma to help her son and daughter-in-law — both U.S. Marines — care for their 2-year-old son, while the daughter-in-law recovered from surgery.

At the Eloy Detention Center, Pelaez broke into tears when Kelly asked about the pride she felt at her son’s boot-camp graduation, Kelly recalled. Although an immigration judge approved the woman’s release from detention on bond, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is fighting that decision with an appeal, Kelly said.

“They did not want to let her out,” Kelly said. As the mother of someone willing to fight for their country, “she is the exact type of person we should want in this country,” he said.

Kelly said he also met with Kelly Yu, a Peoria restaurant owner who fled Hong Kong in 2004 and whose months-long ICE detention has generated outrage. Yu, whose U.S. citizen child attends Arizona State University, employs 70 people at her three restaurant locations and has no criminal record, yet could be deported any day, Kelly said.

“She’s created a life here. She’s a job creator,” he said. “Present this case to any reasonable person and they would say, ‘What are we doing? Why would we throw this woman out of the country?’ She’s not a risk to anyone. She’s putting food on the table for 70 other families. It just doesn’t make any sense.”

In the Eloy Detention Center, 83% of detainees are classified by ICE as having “no ICE threat level,” meaning they have no criminal convictions, according to the most recent ICE data.

Oversight curtailed under Trump

Kelly is the latest of several Democratic U.S. legislators who have sought to conduct oversight visits at ICE detention centers, as the number of people in ICE detention reaches record levels and concerns about detention conditions are rising.

Democratic lawmakers have been turned away from ICE facilities when making unannounced visits, even though, by law, Congress members are not required to give prior notice of oversight visits.

A dozen Democratic legislators sued the Trump administration on July 30 over the prior-notice requirement it’s imposed on ICE oversight visits.

“Federal law makes it absolutely clear that members of Congress do not have to provide prior notice for those visits, for clear reasons,” said U.S. Rep. Greg Stanton, D-Arizona, on Friday. “That way we don’t get a curated visit. We get an impromptu visit, so we can see conditions as they actually are.”

Turned away after an unannounced visit to Eloy in July, Stanton scheduled an Eloy visit on Aug. 5 and met with 20 detainees who shared “eye-opening” stories, Stanton told the Star. The detainees included asylum seekers and people who said they’ve lived in the U.S. for decades and have no criminal record, he said.

“The president talked about enforcement of immigration laws by going after violent criminals,” Stanton said. “That’s not what’s actually happening.”

U.S. Rep. Yassamin Ansari, D-Arizona, conducted a surprise oversight visit at Eloy in May, in which she said she encountered “sickening” detention conditions. Last month, Ansari said she was denied the opportunity to speak with three detainees, including Yu, who had given permission to speak with Ansari during a scheduled July 19 visit.

Neither ICE nor the Department of Homeland Security responded to the Star’s repeated inquiries about why Ansari wasn’t permitted to speak with the detainees.

In a statement, an unnamed DHS spokesperson said Ansari still would have been allowed to tour the facility.

“After being told that Ansari would be unable to speak with detainees, her office did not even show up or have the courtesy to send a cancellation notice to ICE,” the DHS statement said. “Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are FALSE. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens.”

An August report from Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia, identified more than 500 “credible reports of human rights abuse” in U.S. immigration detention centers since January.

Advocates say concerns about inhumane detention conditions will only worsen as ICE arrest numbers rise, and as DHS scrambles to construct more detention space.

Arizona ‘Alligator Alcatraz’?

This week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem named Arizona among possible states that could house a new state-run immigration facility like “Alligator Alcatraz,” which DHS hastily erected in the Florida Everglades.

DHS has not yet contacted Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs’ office about the possibility, but “if they did ask, we would not participate,” Hobbs’ spokesman Christian Slater said in an email.

Kelly said he’s opposed to the idea, and to the allocation of so much taxpayer money to incarcerating immigrants who pose no public safety threat, at the expense of public spending in areas such as education and scientific research.

“We are now investing in the wrong thing. We’re going to invest in prisons for people who are no threat to anybody? That doesn’t make sense,” Kelly said.

In July, Congress approved $170 billion for immigration and border enforcement, including $45 billion for building new ICE detention facilities and $30 billion for ICE enforcement and deportation operations.

“The budget of ICE is going to be bigger than the U.S. Marine Corps in a heartbeat,” said Kelly, a Navy combat veteran.

‘Moment’ for immigration reform?

Public support for immigration has been rising in the U.S. A July Gallup poll found a record-high 79% of respondents say immigration is a good thing for the country.

The shift in public sentiment comes as the Trump administration has targeted not only undocumented immigrants with criminal records, but increasingly people without any criminal history, or with minor non-violent offenses, who have lived in the country for decades.

“Mass deportation involves deporting our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues, people our kids go to school with,” Stanton said. “And it turns out, deporting these individuals is very unpopular with the American people.”

Trump’s DHS is also arresting and deporting legal immigrants and asylum seekers who entered the U.S. with the government’s permission and proper documentation. ICE agents have been waiting at immigration courthouses to arrest people attending required hearings.

Kelly said it could be the right moment for Congress to finally enact comprehensive immigration reform, as well as protections for “Dreamers,” unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.

“Maybe this is a moment we could do something that’s positive,” Kelly said. “I know a bunch of my Republican colleagues, they get it. They don’t think we should be deporting 10 million people, despite what the president of the United States says. They do not all agree with that. That’s not a reasonable system that helps us as a nation.”

Stanton agreed now could be the time to “build an immigration system that supports and grows the American economy,” including supporting the agriculture and health-care industries and talented international students. He also supports giving Dreamers a path to citizenship, a proposal with broad public support.

With the southern border secure, “Now is the time to have those conversations,” Stanton said. “We need immigration policies that support the aging of America, in terms of taking care of our seniors, parents and grandparents. We’re going to need a visa system that brings in a trained work force in that important area.”

Nearly 70% of likely voters support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years and are married to a citizen, and 64% support a path to citizenship for those brought to the U.S. as children, a May poll from Data for Progress found.

Immigration experts say Congress has poured money into border and ICE enforcement, without tackling common-sense immigration reforms that would help fix the system, such as adding more immigration judges and asylum officers.

Republicans have blocked multiple attempts to modernize the immigration system, which hasn’t been updated in three decades.

Less than 1% of people who want to move to the U.S. have a legal pathway to do so, according to the Cato Institute, and long-time undocumented immigrants face a potential 10-year ban from the U.S., under a Clinton-era law, if they try to regularize their status.

Kelly said he had issues with the Biden administration’s handling of the southern border, amid a global increase in migration, until Biden imposed controversial restrictions on asylum access in mid-2024.

But under Trump, Kelly said, “We’re wildly swinging in the other direction, in a way that is not in the best interest of this country.”

Advocates say Biden violated U.S. law with his June 2024 asylum restrictions, which have been credited with reducing the number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border to seek asylum.

In May, a federal court ruled that most of Biden’s asylum restrictions violated U.S. immigration law that allows people to request asylum once on U.S. soil, regardless of how they entered the country.

Long-standing problem

Problems with immigration detention conditions are long-standing, but appear to be worsening under Trump, as the administration has dramatically curtailed oversight offices that receive and investigate complaints, including the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, said Liz Casey, social worker on the advocacy team at the nonprofit Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.

Casey has heard from ICE detainees about problems accessing medical care, unclean conditions, broken air conditioning, verbal abuse and discrimination by guards, as well as overcrowding and understaffing in ICE detention facilities.

“Not having any oversight seemingly is making conditions and abuses significantly worse,” she said, based on recent anecdotal accounts from detainees. “There needs to be truly independent oversight, with actual accountability and consequences when rights are violated.”

A spokesman for CoreCivic, the private company that runs the Eloy Detention Center and Florence Correctional Complex, said CoreCivic takes the health and safety of its detainees seriously.

“Our immigration facilities are monitored very closely by our government partners at ICE, and they are required to undergo regular review and audit processes to ensure an appropriate standard of living and care for all detainees,” said public affairs manager Brian Todd in a Friday email.

Immigration detention is civil in nature, intended to hold people during removal proceedings, rather than as punishment for a crime, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.

Casey said immigration detention is “inherently inhumane,” and she’s concerned by the Trump administration’s resistance to unannounced congressional oversight visits.

“We are very grateful that people are using their congressional power to do any type of visits or oversight right now. It’s still extremely useful,” she said. “But unannounced inspections would be much more like true oversight.”

My session with Dr. Phil had reached an impasse.

About three hours in, seated inside the Dallas mega-mansion where he is steering his herky-jerk transition from daytime TV behemoth to MAGA-friendly newsman, the once-licensed psychologist was giving no ground on what seemed to me an obvious point.

“I don’t think I’m qualified to talk about politics,” he said, steepling his fingers in contemplation. And so, he insisted, he really hadn’t.

This was difficult to square with recent events.

In the last two years, Dr. Phil (surname: McGraw) had ended his flagship talk show and created his own news and entertainment network, trafficking daily in conservative-coded subjects — “Dr. Phil: The Hidden Gem in Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’” “Dr. Phil Investigates: Are Schools Secretly Transitioning Your Child?” — in an unswerving crusade against “the woke left.”

He had spoken glowingly of President Trump as an invited guest at Mr. Trump’s Madison Square Garden campaign rally, at a White House faith event and at a recent Texas flood briefing, where the president interrupted himself after spotting Dr. Phil — “There’s Dr. Phil. Look at Dr. Phil. You’re looking good, Phil. This is a hell of a situation, isn’t it?” — and later asked him to address the bereaved.

Most strikingly, Dr. Phil had secured intimate access to embed with a camera crew on Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, pledging to agents that his broadcasting aim was to “tell your story and have your back.”

Dr. Phil likes to say that his focus is social and cultural issues and always has been, since his Oprah-ordained rise as a tough-loving public mediator of family dramas. It is the politicians, he says, who have lurched into his lane, not the other way around.

He does not care about the Federal Reserve, he noted, with a merry profanity. He does not understand the mechanics of legislation.

That was more policy than politics, I suggested.

“I don’t know!” he said. “You’re making my point.”

And his macro point was this: “I’ve spent so much of my life focused on why people do what they do,” Dr. Phil said, by way of mission statement, “and don’t do what they don’t do.”

In recent months, friends, detractors and former associates have wondered often why Dr. Phil is doing what he is doing — barreling into partisan media after a lucrative career as a big-tent hitmaker — and why he is not doing what he is not doing: recognizing that he has barreled into partisan media.

What is beyond debate is that Dr. Phil, 74, has exposed his shrink-next-door reputation to the whims of a fractured, fractious media ecosystem quite unlike the one he conquered.

It has already been messy. Last month, his company, Merit Street Media, filed for bankruptcy in a hail of litigation involving its faith-based partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network. (Dr. Phil swiftly announced a new venture with similar ambitions, Envoy Media, and has begun producing content under its banner.)

Yet whatever his professional fortunes, Dr. Phil has emerged once more as an avatar of his times, a drawling testament to the commingling of entertainment and civic life.

The president, his acquaintance of two decades, is a fellow network television stalwart of the early 2000s. The Department of Homeland Security has mulled a reality show for immigrants to compete for citizenship.

Can it really be said that Dr. Phil looks out of place, lumbering on a balky knee beside federal authorities, making “Cops”-style television out of early-morning ICE arrests?

“With so much fake news circulating about the work ICE agents do, we’re grateful for those like Dr. Phil who are willing to share the truth,” Tom Homan, the president’s border czar, said in a statement sent by the White House. The two have regularly shared the screen.

Still an advocate, he says, for legal immigration and gay rights, Dr. Phil believes he has nonetheless lost friends from his bygone life in Beverly Hills, Calif., where he keeps a home.

He has faced death threats, he said — there was little of that in daytime. (He attributed this largely to his stands against antisemitism.) He has failed publicly as never before, after a long talk-show reign at No. 1, for the high privilege of clawing into the living algorithm of ubiquitous news chatter.

“I don’t have to be doing this at all,” he noted. “This is not a got-to job. This is a get-to job.”

But then, people are complicated — “Dr. Phil” proved this every weekday — and during our four-hour visit last month, Dr. Phil took care to project that he is, too.

He is a self-described “old country boy from Texas and Oklahoma” whose Dallas home includes glimmering door handles fashioned into a lower-case “d” and “p,” a boulder-size Lego wall installation depicting scenes and characters from his life, “seven or eight” fireplaces, a Banksy, a coffee-table book about maximalism and a decorative rooster of unknown provenance.

“There’s something special about it,” he said, sighing a bit, during a mostly affectless tour of the space. “I don’t know what it is.”

He is known to keep two essential items in the trunk of his Rolls-Royce: a shotgun and a tennis bag. “You never know,” he reasoned.

He considers himself a journalist (“You think I’m overqualified?”) and does not dwell on why ICE has furnished him with premium access. “We’ve asked for it,” he said bluntly.

He has a face so recognizable from his old career — the sheriff-grade mustache, the furrowed helipad of a forehead — that it can shadow his newer one.

“You’re Dr. Phil,” a Thai immigrant told Dr. Phil, mid-arrest, last January in Chicago. The host had been questioning the man, whom authorities accused of sexual misconduct, beside Mr. Homan.

“How do you know me?” Dr. Phil asked.

“I’ve seen Dr. Phil on TV.”

Dr. Phil looked almost resigned.

“Yeah.”

Becoming ‘Dr. Phil’

In many ways, Dr. Phil’s arc is the story of America’s last three decades of media, celebrity, politics and media-celebrity-politics.

If anything, he was the more prolific TV frontman than Mr. Trump, the truer bootstraps story, the host with his wagging finger on the pulse of the great American middle.

With a few tweaks to the wayback machine of modern politics, is it so impossible to imagine Dr. Phil as the high officeholder — certainly friends and strangers prodded him through the years — and Mr. Trump as the fading media giant whose new venture just went bust?

“He is and always has been inevitable,” Rachael Ray, a talk-show contemporary, said of Dr. Phil. “He understands the concept that you are here to serve your audience.”

Dr. Phil’s public journey began, inadvertently, before an audience of one: the most famous civil defendant in daytime.

Raised across Oklahoma, Colorado and Kansas — his hard-drinking father was an oil-rig equipment supplier before he pursued a psychology career — Dr. Phil worked initially as a psychologist himself. He later co-founded a trial preparation consultancy, attracting high-profile clients, including Exxon, after the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, and eventually, fatefully, Oprah Winfrey.

She hired him after Texas cattlemen sued over a 1996 episode about mad cow disease. After the trial, Ms. Winfrey was so taken with Dr. Phil’s pitiless charm and boundless aphorisms (“It may not be fair but it is,” “Winners do things losers don’t want to do”) that she made him an on-air regular.

By 2002, he had his own show, entrenching himself firmly in the zeitgeist of the new millennium. He hosted quarreling couples, unruly teens, a sitting president and first lady (George W. and Laura Bush) and a go-to financial guru and future senator named Elizabeth Warren.

“I figured out really early on: You better listen to your audience and meet them where they are,” Dr. Phil said, “instead of asking them to meet you where you are.”

He enshrined himself — alongside Dr. Mehmet Oz, now Mr. Trump’s overseer of Medicare and Medicaid — as part of an Oprah-branded constellation whose emphasis on health and wellness seemed to partly presage the Make America Healthy Again movement. (A representative for Ms. Winfrey did not respond to messages.)

While Dr. Phil was sometimes criticized for unseemly voyeurism or reductive counsel, there was evidence that his show did some good. A 2016 study suggested that devoted “Dr. Phil” viewers were likelier to seek mental health treatment.

As with much of daytime television, including Ms. Winfrey’s show, the moment of peak cultural primacy passed. Ratings sagged. A 2022 BuzzFeed News article described a “toxic workplace” at “Dr. Phil.” A 2017 investigation by STAT and The Boston Globe reported that the program sometimes exploited and endangered people with addiction problems. (The show denied this.)

Beyond the Paramount lot where he filmed in Hollywood, Dr. Phil hinted at broader interests. In public appearances, he defended trans people and backed gun reform measures after mass shootings. He dissected white privilege on “The Breakfast Club” radio show.

He started a podcast (“Phil in the Blanks”) in 2019. He appraised Mr. Trump, sometimes critically, on late-night television.

“I can’t diagnose him because I haven’t done proper evaluations,” Dr. Phil told Jimmy Kimmel mischievously during the president’s first term. But “certain personality disorders” came to mind.

When Covid hit, Dr. Phil seemed to find more common cause with the political right, chastising authorities over school lockdowns. “I was labeled a nut,” he told Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now Mr. Trump’s health secretary, during an affectionate televised forum last spring.

“Dr. Phil” ended in 2023 — of his volition, he has said. Friends encouraged his new explorations.

“We know you’re apolitical,” Bill Maher told him, with an exaggerated wink, on a podcast last year.

By then, Dr. Phil had produced a new book, “We’ve Got Issues,” pitched directly at the culture wars. He lamented a country that “can’t stand success” and cowered before “the tyranny of the fringe”: those who believe that “every white person is a racist,” that anyone concerned with youth gender identity “is a hateful transphobe,” that every gun owner “is an advocate of violence.”

He referred to “cancel culture,” or variations of it, nearly four dozen times.

Hoping to sharpen his book’s arguments, Dr. Phil enlisted Jeff Nussbaum, a longtime speechwriter for former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., as a Democratic foil.

“I took pride in being a sparring partner,” Mr. Nussbaum said, “though recent events seem to show that either I lost or he moved to a different ring.”

The Doctor and the President

In June 2024, Merit Street Media secured a major get: the presumptive Republican nominee, hosting Dr. Phil at Mar-a-Lago.

“You’ve always been very special,” Mr. Trump told him.

The interview, one month before Mr. Trump was shot in Butler, Pa., is a remarkable rewatch — and a prime example of what can often impress Mr. Trump most: He prizes people who succeed on television. Staring at the face of TV psychology, he seemed compelled to take advantage.

And so, Mr. Trump, rarely prone to introspection or therapist-speak, observed that he had “a very good disposition for trauma.” He spoke openly about his tendency to suppress stress.

“You’re sort of being my psychiatrist,” Mr. Trump said. “Maybe I could use a psychiatrist.”

Dr. Phil urged Mr. Trump against governing vengefully if elected. (Asked in our interview if the president listened, Dr. Phil said, “I mean, he hasn’t locked anybody up.” The same day, Mr. Trump baselessly accused former President Barack Obama of treason and said it was “time to go after people.”)

But with an online audience of millions, the sit-down fulfilled an early Merit aspiration: demonstrating Dr. Phil’s range.

“Phil has an intuitive ability to read the national culture,” said Ken Solomon, a longtime friend and tennis partner who became Merit TV’s chief executive. The daytime show, Mr. Solomon added, “was narrow compared to his overall expertise.”

TV veterans like Steve Harvey and Nancy Grace joined the roster. The Professional Bull Riders league signed on. Executives outlined plans to reach more than 100 million homes, even as some in Dr. Phil’s orbit clocked the overstuffed media landscape.

“Starting a start-up in this climate in entertainment is just next to impossible,” said Harvey Levin, the TMZ co-founder, who is friendly with Dr. Phil. “When I heard he was doing that — boy.”

Merit recruited a team of more than 100 to the Fort Worth area to work from its five-acre studio, where Dr. Phil often arrived by helicopter. His stated goal was to “own the debate lane.”

But quickly, employees said, the preferred contours of that debate became clear. Guest bookings tilted decidedly right. Dr. Phil warned viewers that “illegal immigrants are fueling crime across America.” He enthused over what he considered agreeable conditions for immigrant detainees. “You said there are even exercise classes for the women,” he nudged Mr. Homan amid raids in Los Angeles.

Activists scorned him as a tool of the state.

“When you are riding along with the government, they are putting you on a publicity tour,” Alida Garcia, an organizer and former immigration official under Mr. Biden, said in an interview. “He is participating as basically a propaganda machine for ICE.”

Producers whom Dr. Phil’s team made available for this article said he cared only about following the facts. “If it’s towards one side more than the other,” one producer, Justin Arluck, said, “that’s where the facts are.”

Asked if he had been aware of other employees’ concerns about political material, Dr. Phil paused for a beat. “They certainly should not be expected to be involved with it if it’s not something they can passionately commit to,” he said.

Dr. Phil’s appearance at Mr. Trump’s rally last fall seemed to signal his political intentions, though he suggests this was largely an accident.

He has said he would have also appeared with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming that her camp failed to follow up after some initial discussions. Several senior Harris campaign aides said they were unaware of any such dialogue.

Mr. Solomon, the close friend and a longtime Democratic fund-raiser, said he and Dr. Phil had “a difference of opinion” on the Trump event. “I said, ‘Well, if you just do the one, people are going to come to the conclusion that they have come to,’” Mr. Solomon recalled.

That conclusion still appears to bother Dr. Phil. He declined to say if he even voted for Mr. Trump despite his cameo at Madison Square Garden.

“When people ask me about that, I ask them if they’ve listened to what I said,” he said. “Did you?”

I said I could understand why those watching him at the Trump rally, where chants of “Dr. Phil!” echoed, concluded that he was probably voting for Mr. Trump.

“They have impeached him, indicted him, raided him, railroaded him, shot him and sued him,” Dr. Phil told the arena. “And where is he? He is still standing.”

Dr. Phil also plugged his network, celebrated the First Amendment and did not explicitly endorse the candidate. If other guests slung maximally red meat — labeling Ms. Harris “the Antichrist,” smearing Puerto Rico — his offering might fairly be classified as medium-rare.

“I was with Trump during his MSG speech and remember it was pretty lukewarm,” Tucker Carlson, another rally speaker, said of Dr. Phil in a text message.

He added that he had never watched Merit.

“Nothing against Dr. Phil,” Mr. Carlson said. “I just hate all television.”

Walking the MAGA Line

This wider reaction to Dr. Phil’s rally appearance — searing liberal disdain, mild conservative gratitude — was instructive.

He was MAGA-affiliated but not quite MAGA. He was in the room but not of it.

Merit’s ratings seemed to reflect its neither-fish-nor-fowl status, placing the network fathoms behind not only established competitors like Fox News but also relative upstarts like Newsmax and NewsNation. (Dr. Phil’s team insists Merit was gathering momentum, citing encouraging viewership figures on Inauguration Day.)

Some employees had hoped that Mr. Trump’s return, and his nominal closeness with Dr. Phil, might boost the business.

In March, Merit occupied the “new media” seat in the White House briefing room. In May, the president praised Dr. Phil and Merit from the Rose Garden. (Dr. Phil attended in his capacity as an appointee to a federal committee on religious liberty.)

But the company was wobbling. Last month, Merit filed for bankruptcy and accused its partner, Trinity Broadcasting Network, of reneging on commitments. (Trinity did not respond to messages seeking comment.)

Professional Bull Riders, moving to recoup roughly $180 million from its media rights deal, has also joined the legal morass. Merit has made counterclaims.

The dispute seems to have dented Dr. Phil’s standing in some corners of his former city.

“He stopped paying us and tried to tear up and walk away from his contractual commitment simply because he had a change of heart,” said Mark Shapiro, a top associate of the Hollywood super-executive Ari Emanuel and the president of TKO, which owns Professional Bull Riders. “I’ve really never seen anything like it.”

None of this has stopped Dr. Phil from announcing a breakaway venture, Envoy Media, for which loyalists are preparing a new studio space in Irving, Tex., that previously housed a Spanish-language TV company.

In our interview, Dr. Phil hailed Envoy’s “disruptive” potential, sprinkling in buzz-phrases like “citizen journalism platform” and “interactive app.”

Retirement does not appear to have occurred to him.

“This is not what I do. It’s who I am,” he said. “And I’m not sure that that’s always healthy.”

Certainly there are other ways to spend his time. Dr. Phil has been married to his wife, Robin McGraw, with whom he has two adult children, for nearly five decades.

His outdoor tennis court includes misters to counteract the Dallas heat. A whirring staff minds the grounds and hands him unsweetened iced teas. He is quick to attribute the home’s trimmings to Mrs. McGraw, describing their prodigious collection of art and light fixtures so dryly that it can be difficult to tell when he is joking:

“Everybody needs winged lightbulbs.”

“Every one of those pieces of glass was put up individually by these people from Czechoslovakia, if you can imagine.”

Such are the spoils of an uncommon American life — and a reminder, those who know him say, of why Dr. Phil might do the things he does.

“He really is a sort of Horatio Alger story and really believed strongly that anyone could take a similar path,” said Mr. Nussbaum, the former Biden aide who helped with his book. “That’s the genesis of his advice-giving.”

While some Democrats have accused Dr. Phil of pandering, many of his present views appear sincerely felt. He is, friends noted, an affluent septuagenarian Texan whose beliefs broadly reflect his peer group’s.

In one recent video, Dr. Phil covered what he saw as an outsize backlash against another Texan, Beyoncé, for wearing a shirt considered insensitive to Native Americans.

When, he wondered, did intentions stop mattering? What happened to critical thinking?

“Hell hath no fury,” he told viewers, “like the woke left finding a new celebrity to cancel.”

As we sat in his home office, with a large rendering of the “Hollywood” sign behind him and a backpack from the Bel-Air Country Club on the desk, I asked if he ever felt as though the line applied to him.

He almost smirked.

“Yeah.”

I’ve never been arrested in my life.” Inside the detention center The first night in the detention center, he was put in a room with all of the incoming detainees and it was very cold, Rocha said.

A black monitor is strapped to his left ankle, he can’t travel outside of Washington state, and he has to check in with Department of Homeland Security authorities virtually each week and in person every two months until his asylum hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.

In his car, he wonders if he’ll get pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement again. At home, if they will come to his door.

“My life is now a nightmare,” said Rocha. “I feel like I’m a hostage.”

The theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland spent nearly two weeks at the Northwest detention center, after being detained July 17 on the grounds that his tourist visa had expired. It had, but Rocha had applied for asylum and had a valid pending asylum case and a valid work permit, said his attorney, Adolfo Ojeda.

ICE Seattle also claimed Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft. During Rocha’s bond hearing, Judge Tammy Fitting noted the allegations about the theft in Brazil but didn’t address them further and released Rocha on a $10,000 bond, with other conditions set by ICE.

Rocha provided a document from the Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Brazil that stated there is “no record of a final conviction in the name of Fernando Alves Rocha, country of nationality Brazil.” The Seattle Times reached out to the same ministry and didn’t receive an immediate response.

“I’m so grateful to not be in the center, grateful to my attorney and funds from the GoFundMe” started by his fellow members in the IATSE Local 15 theater workers union, Rocha said. The fund drive, now closed, raised more than $36,000 for Rocha’s bond and legal fees.

“But (the ankle monitor) is embarrassing, kind of barbaric,” Rocha said. “I have no criminal records. It’s a way to dehumanize immigrants and make us feel like we aren’t equal.”

Life in Brazil

In Brazil, Rocha was a drama teacher and ran a theater group for 23 years that traveled all around the world — including Seattle in 2010 — to perform. He earned a master’s degree in art from the Universidade Federal de Uberlândia in Brazil.

He said he was very happy with his life in Brazil and never thought he would leave, but in 2016 the school where he worked was taken over by a student protest group.

They invaded the theater where he worked, trashed puppets and costumes, and graffitied the walls. Rocha said he started to get death threats and worried about his safety.

He began to think about moving to Europe or somewhere else for a more stable life — at the very least, to get away from the unrest in Brazil. He came to the United States in 2018 on a tourist visa and thought he might return to Brazil if conditions improved. They didn’t, and then the pandemic hit and made it even less appealing to go back home. He decided to apply for asylum.

“I just saw my life (in Brazil) getting further and further away from me,” Rocha said. “I had less and less to return to.”

He applied for asylum, completing the three-month application process the day before his visa expired. After he got initial word his asylum application was received, he got a work permit, which allowed him to work while he was waiting for a ruling on asylum status, said Ojeda, his attorney.

At that point, Rocha had a “valid pending asylum claim,” Ojeda said, so his tourist visa was extended for one year.

“It’s a weird kind of extension that is between legal, not legal,” Ojeda said. Rocha wasn’t accruing unlawful trespassing time in the U.S. or doing anything wrong, Ojeda added.

“I thought I was protected. That’s what my lawyer said and the documents I had received from the government had said: that while I was waiting, I was protected,” Rocha said. “That’s why (getting arrested) was so surreal for me. It came from nowhere. I was in shock.”

Moment of arrest

Rocha was driving to work around 7:30 a.m. July 17 when a car with flashing lights stopped him.

“In the moment, I was so afraid I didn’t think straight to realize how a person would say that I’m being arrested if they didn’t know my name,” Rocha said. “I should’ve asked, ‘Do you know my name? Do you know who I am? Why are you arresting me?’”

He said the officers wore simple police vests that didn’t display the letters ICE or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, so he was unsure why he was being pulled over and told to get out of the car.

“I thought I was being kidnapped,” Rocha said. “The people who approached didn’t look official to me. … I had no idea why I would be arrested.”

The officers reached through his open window and unlocked the door and forced him out of his car, Rocha said. He fell onto the ground, scratching his knees and elbows, and an officer put a knee on top of his back, Rocha said. While he was face down on the asphalt, they cuffed his wrists and ankles, he said.

“It was a nightmare. It was crazy. I just freaked out,” Rocha said. “I didn’t know how to deal with the situation. I’ve never been arrested in my life.”

Inside the detention center

The first night in the detention center, he was put in a room with all of the incoming detainees and it was very cold, Rocha said. He wasn’t given any blankets, he said.

A lot of people were sick, and when they tried to get medical attention, they sometimes were told they had to come back another time or were only given Tylenol, Rocha said.

The food was “like a white soup,” Rocha said. He and his fellow detainees couldn’t identify what it was and most people didn’t eat it. One day they served eggs that were green and smelled bad, Rocha said. He noticed the officers never drank the water from the faucets and had their own water bottles.

There have been hundreds of complaints about the food and water quality at the detention center, and research conducted by the University of Washington documented unsatisfactory food, water and medical care.

Some of the detainees had money and could buy food and water at the commissary but delivery took three days, he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said, “any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE Northwest detention center in Tacoma are false. All detainees are provided with proper meals, quality water, blankets, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers.”

She added that it is a longstanding practice to provide “comprehensive medical care.” “Meals are certified by dietitians,” she said, and “ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

Christopher Ferreira, director of corporate relations for the GEO Group, which owns the detention center, said it provides “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietitian-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.”

He also said that facilities are never overcrowded and that physicians, nurses, dentists, psychologists and psychiatrists are available, adding that “access to off-site medical specialists, imaging facilities, emergency medical services, and local community hospitals is also provided when needed.”

Rocha said that after the first night, everyone was sorted into different colors depending on their situation. He said he was in the blue group, for those without criminal records.

It was much quieter there, Rocha said. Groups of people gathered to read the Bible. Muslims laid out their prayer rugs five times a day to pray.

The first week, some detainees huddled around a 3,000-piece puzzle of marine creatures. During his second week, he said, they did a different puzzle with Charlie Brown characters on it.

Rocha tried to do the puzzle but wasn’t very good at it. He was better at listening to people’s stories.

“Everybody was trying to help each other,” Rocha said. “They kind of have this empathy for each other. Even not knowing each other but knowing that we are all in this together.”

Although a community was being built, it didn’t make Rocha feel better.

“Every story I heard made me more anxious,” Rocha said. “Oh my God, if this guy has (proper documents) or (a better situation) and he’s here, I have no chance.”

“A lot of people were just giving up, saying, ‘I just want to go home (to their country of origin) because it is exhausting staying in this facility,’” Rocha said.

He said it, too, to his attorney.

“Please take me out of here. Even if it’s just for me to pack my stuff and go home. I don’t deserve to be here. I’m getting sick and I don’t want to stay here. This is torture.”

Released

The morning of his bond hearing, Rocha sat and waited on the wooden benches that looked like church pews, watching the judge hear other detainees’ cases.

“I was tense,” Rocha said. “The judge seemed tough.”

As the morning passed, though, he said he felt that she was fair and attentive with each case.

“I was so confident that I was innocent of what they were accusing me of, so I tried to sit (in front of the judge) with dignity,” Rocha said. “I was really hopeful she would be fair.”

Judge Fitting noted that she was concerned Rocha resisted ICE at first but did not find him a flight risk. She noted his valid work permit and pending asylum claim. She set the bond at $10,000.

“Oh my God. A relief that I’ve never felt before,” Rocha said in an interview immediately after his release. “I’ve never been arrested in my life. I’ve never lost my liberty, my freedom, in my life. It was an almost indescribable kind of relief. It is hard to explain. All I can say is that it is the best relief I’ve ever had in my life.”

Back at home

When Rocha got home, he was sick and needed to rest, but he started to read the hundreds of messages he received from people and countless other social media posts.

“We are shocked and heartbroken to learn one of our former JCI students and community members, Fernando Rocha, has been detained by ICE,” wrote Jet City Improv on its Instagram page. “Fernando was part of one of the first post-pandemic classes at JCI. He’s an extraordinary human full of heart, talent, and resilience.”

Rocha didn’t cry in the detention center. He said he didn’t want to be a victim there. He did his best to stay strong and keep a mindset that he would get out soon.

But back at home, after seeing the messages, he finally let himself cry.

“I just keep crying and crying and crying,” Rocha said. “It is good tears. Tears of relief, tears of gratitude and of hope to see that this country still has good people.

That shift in tactics meant that immigrants with criminal convictions no longer made up the bulk of California ICE arrests.
They faced off with ICE agents in Home Depot parking lots and at warehouses and farms.
But this week, federal agents carried out a series of raids at Home Depots from Westlake to Van Nuys.
Then, as a frenetic drum and bass mix kicked in, federal agents jump out of a van and chase people.","Ever since federal immigration raids ramped up across California, triggering fierce protests that prompted President Trump to deploy troops to Los Angeles, the state has emerged as the symbolic battleground of the administration’s deportation campaign.

But even as arrests soared, California was not the epicenter of Trump’s anti-immigrant project.

In the first five months of Trump’s second term, California lagged behind the staunchly red states of Texas and Florida in the total arrests. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data from the Deportation Data Project, Texas reported 26,341 arrests — nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests nationally — followed by 12,982 in Florida and 8,460 in California.

Even in June, when masked federal immigration agents swept through L.A., jumping out of vehicles to snatch people from bus stops, car washes and parking lots, California saw 3,391 undocumented immigrants arrested — more than Florida, but still only about half as many as Texas.

When factoring in population, California drops to 27th in the nation, with 217 arrests per million residents — about a quarter of Texas’ 864 arrests per million and less than half of a whole slew of states including Florida, Arkansas, Utah, Arizona, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Virginia and Nevada.

The data, released after a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the government, excludes arrests made after June 26 and lacks identifying state details in 5% of cases. Nevertheless, it provides the most detailed look yet of national ICE operations.

Immigration experts say it is not surprising that California — home to the largest number of undocumented immigrants in the nation and the birthplace of the Chicano movement — lags behind Republican states in the total number of arrests or arrests as a percentage of the population.

“The numbers are secondary to the performative politics of the moment,” said Austin Kocher, a geographer and research assistant professor at Syracuse University who specializes in immigration enforcement.

Part of the reason Republican-dominated states have higher arrest numbers — particularly when measured against population — is they have a longer history of working directly with ICE, and a stronger interest in collaboration. In red states from Texas to Mississippi, local law enforcement officers routinely cooperate with federal agents, either by taking on ICE duties through so-called 287(g) agreements or by identifying undocumented immigrants who are incarcerated and letting ICE into their jails and prisons.

Indeed, data show that just 7% of ICE arrests made this year in California were made through the Criminal Alien Program, an initiative that requests that local law enforcement identify undocumented immigrants in federal, state and local prisons and jails.

That’s significantly lower than the 55% of arrests in Texas and 46% in Florida made through prisons or jails. And other conservative states with smaller populations relied on the program even more heavily: 75% of ICE arrests in Alabama and 71% in Indiana took place via prisons and jails.

“State cooperation has been an important buffer in ICE arrests and ICE operations in general for years,” said Ariel Ruiz Soto, a Sacramento-based senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. “We’ve seen that states are not only willing to cooperate with ICE, but are proactively now establishing 287(g) agreements with their local law enforcement, are naturally going to cast a wider net of enforcement in the boundaries of that state.”

While California considers only some criminal offenses, such as serious felonies, significant enough to share information with ICE; Texas and Florida are more likely to report offenses that may not be as severe, such as minor traffic infractions.

Still, even if fewer people were arrested in California than other states, it also witnessed one of the most dramatic increases in arrests in the country.

California ranked 30th in ICE arrests per million in February. By June, the state had climbed to 10th place.

ICE arrested around 8,460 immigrants across California between Jan. 20 and June 26, a 212% increase compared with the five months before Trump took office. That contrasts with a 159% increase nationally for the same period.

Much of ICE’s activity in California was hyper-focused on Greater Los Angeles: About 60% of ICE arrests in the state took place in the seven counties in and around L.A. during Trump’s first five months in office. The number of arrests in the Los Angeles area soared from 463 in January to 2,185 in June — a 372% spike, second only to New York’s 432% increase.

Even if California is not seeing the largest numbers of arrests, experts say, the dramatic increase in captures stands out from other places because of the lack of official cooperation and public hostility toward immigration agents.

“A smaller increase in a place that has very little cooperation is, in a way, more significant than seeing an increase in areas that have lots and lots of cooperation,” Kocher said.

ICE agents, Kocher said, have to work much harder to arrest immigrants in places like L.A. or California that define themselves as “sanctuary” jurisdictions and limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents.

“They really had to go out of their way,” he said.

Trump administration officials have long argued that sanctuary jurisdictions give them no choice but to round up people on the streets.

Not long after Trump won the 2024 election and the L.A. City Council voted unanimously to block any city resources from being used for immigration enforcement, incoming border enforcement advisor Tom Homan threatened an onslaught.

“If I’ve got to send twice as many officers to L.A. because we’re not getting any assistance, then that’s what we’re going to do,” Homan told Newsmax.

With limited cooperation from California jails, ICE agents went out into communities, rounding up people they suspected of being undocumented on street corners and at factories and farms.

That shift in tactics meant that immigrants with criminal convictions no longer made up the bulk of California ICE arrests. While about 66% of immigrants arrested in the first four months of the year had criminal convictions, that percentage fell to 30% in June.

The sweeping nature of the arrests drew immediate criticism as racial profiling and spawned robust community condemnation.

Some immigration experts and community activists cite the organized resistance in L.A. as another reason the numbers of ICE arrests were lower in California than in Texas and even lower than dozens of states by percentage of population.

“The reason is the resistance, organized resistance: the people who literally went to war with them in Paramount, in Compton, in Bell and Huntington Park,” said Ron Gochez, a member of Unión del Barrio Los Angeles, an independent political group that patrols neighborhoods to alert residents of immigration sweeps.

“They’ve been chased out in the different neighborhoods where we organize,” he said. “We’ve been able to mobilize the community to surround the agents when they come to kidnap people.”

In L.A., activists patrolled the streets from 5 a.m. until 11 p.m., seven days a week, Gochez said. They faced off with ICE agents in Home Depot parking lots and at warehouses and farms.

“We were doing everything that we could to try to keep up with the intensity of the military assault,” Gochez said. “The resistance was strong. … We’ve been able, on numerous occasions, to successfully defend the communities and drive them out of our community.”

The protests prompted Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines in June, with the stated purpose of protecting federal buildings and personnel. But the administration’s ability to ratchet up arrests hit a roadblock on July 11. That’s when a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking immigration agents in Southern and Central California from targeting people based on race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

That decision was upheld last week by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But on Thursday, the Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court to lift the temporary ban on its patrols, arguing that it “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop.”

The order led to a significant drop in arrests across Los Angeles last month. But this week, federal agents carried out a series of raids at Home Depots from Westlake to Van Nuys.

Trump administration officials have indicated that the July ruling and arrest slowdown do not signal a permanent change in tactics.

“Sanctuary cities are going to get exactly what they don’t want: more agents in the communities and more work site enforcement,” Homan told reporters two weeks after the court blocked roving patrols. “Why is that? Because they won’t let one agent arrest one bad guy in the jail.”

U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, who has been leading operations in California, posted a fast-moving video on X that spliced L.A. Mayor Karen Bass telling reporters that “this experiment that was practiced on the city of Los Angeles failed” with video showing him grinning. Then, as a frenetic drum and bass mix kicked in, federal agents jump out of a van and chase people.

“When you’re faced with opposition to law and order, what do you do?” Bovino wrote. “Improvise, adapt, and overcome!”

Clearly, the Trump administration is willing to expend significant resources to make California a political battleground and test case, Ruiz Soto said. The question is, at what economic and political cost?

“If they really wanted to scale up and ramp up their deportations,” Ruiz Soto said, “they could go to other places, do it more more safely, more quickly and more efficiently.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a8cb87/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2Ff9%2F4ccaeac14f51afeafcd9c3f4f082%2F1511112-me-0620-ice-action-bell-gem-004.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 11:57:30.538959

Do far right racist people like it when people get angry or upset about immigration?","It’s odd watching your country from afar.

I’ve been doing that, a bit (I was on holiday) recently. I was with the descendants of the Vikings who turn out to be more of a behaviour than a race. Yes some of them saw our shores and raided them, but by no means all of them. In the true sense of the word being a Vikingyr meant being a pirate and not every person we call a Viking was, at all.

These past two weeks I have not looked enviously back at my country thinking ‘what riches lie there’ but observed it through the filter of Norwegians, who, it must be said have a general good will to Britain, to do with royal links and our assistance during WW2.

We might post sarcastic comments on social media about the quality, but 80 years later we are still annual recipients of a huge Christmas tree for Trafalgar Square. If you think of the logistics that’s quite the thank you.

While I was away, the UK seemed to tie itself in knots over men of fighting age crossing the sea to settle in Britain. And of course there exist, usually with police escort, those who angrily cry “racist” at anyone who dares question current immigration policy.

It’s funny but since since Jeremy Corbyn and Zara Sultana set up their sixth form politics group as a party, you may have noticed the ‘be kind’ crowd have re-emerged being anything but if you disagree with them. I do disagreed with them, profoundly, but am grateful. Given questions about “14 years” of Conservative Government, Corbyn and his ilk did the Tories a huge favour, keeping he and his party far from power but re-enforcing ours.

The far left howl about how many more votes he got than Blair or Starmer, but electoral maths was never their strong suit.

It’s the numbers of people coming across the sea that still bothers us in Britain, and the truth is we have every right to be concerned, and to want it stopped. No, the last Conservative government did not do enough to tackle illegal migration, Labour have done far less whilst constantly bleating they’ve “secured our borders” and overseeing record numbers crossing the Channel in dinghies.

This trumpeted French deal, is highly unlikely to be the deterrent they hope for. I still maintain the best tactic Labour could have empoloyed was to review Rwanda, dress it up as a Labour revamp and used it. After all we now learn the US are now going to use it at our expense. Just like the Chagos Islands.

In Norway they had a refreshing view of our immigration issues. To be fair they have historical experience of coming to our shores in boats, primarily in search of riches. The main point, and yes of course they too have those who shout ‘racism’ at just about anything, is, in the main, they don’t see illegal migration as an issue of race.

Good, because it isn’t and we shouldn’t let it be. It is about resources and culture clash. Tim Montgomerie – or ‘Number One”, as I refer to him (since he calls me ‘Number Three’) wrote the same on social media, and he’s gone to Reform who draw the biggest flak around race and migration.

It was interesting to watch from afar how much those on the left want to make any criticism or protest about immigration ‘far right’ or ‘racist’. And like all of Labour’s tin eared communications they never realise it doesn’t work.

Using hotels and opening more of them, despite their promise to close them for asylum seekers, was always unpopular, for any party. I have personally been lobbied by MPs begging the Home Office to shut a hotel in their constituency to illegal migrants. My former boss James Cleverly had a site in his constituency. That he could not, and would not, as a Secretary of State simply move them elsewhere for his own benefit certainly cost him votes. I still think large sites like airfields and old army camps were better all round and I think Labour shut them because they thought they’d get a rousing cheer when they did.

But they didn’t. When you convince yourselves you’re the only good guys, you get a lot wrong.

The protests around hotels have been framed as racist, and far right, and look, I’m not going to suggest that no single person part of them was either racist or far right, that would be silly, but branding all of them that way, and having counter protests police-escorted in just seemed to me, and my Viking relatives, equally absurd.

There are, I won’t name names, civil servants in the Home Office who quite clearly take the view that action on migrants comes from an ideological dislike of non-white foreigners and that we’d all be better off giving them an amnesty and letting them all stay. One way of reducing the ‘backlog’. Funny because that’s exactly what the Government is quietly doing.

When they boast they are reducing the backlog of asylum applications they never say how many were successful. It’s a lot. One civil servant said rather revealingly in a meeting last year “the thing is Giles basically half the population loves refugees and half the population hates them”

This was false on so many levels it was hard to know where to start.

Nobody has an issue with genuine refugees, but plenty have quite a problem with the assumption that anyone who sets foot off a dingy on a shingle beach in Kent is automatically a refugee. I don’t think people hate them, they just want the influx controlled. And for good measure I don’t think people love them either, I think there is a political wedge that some find useful by pretending they do.

People who struggle to pay their bills don’t like seeing men between 16-40 with an obvious cultural dissonance get ‘better’ treatment than they think they do, from ‘the powers that be’.

The hospitable Vikings who took me into their homes and looked after me, were confused about how we allowed legitimate concerns about illegal migration, with numbers far far smaller than legal migration, to get tangled up with the tricky threads of race and ethnicity.

They get the cultural concerns, and the logistics of looking at an ongoing influx of large numbers when they look at their neighbour Sweden, with sadly shaking heads. They don’t see that as ‘racist’.

I see, indeed I have contributed to, warranted criticism of Starmer, Reeves, Lammy, Kendle, and others, and often wonder how Yvette Cooper escapes an equal tsunami of flak. Her immigration policies have been a complete dud, and no I don’t think this French deal is going to fix things, more than window dressing for a comms strategy that has strayed into, frankly, outright lying.

Do far right racist people like it when people get angry or upset about immigration? Of course. Is being angry or upset about immigration inherently far right and racist? No absolutely not.

To suggest otherwise is, like the Home Secretary, balls.",https://conservativehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Finn_Giles_3-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 10:56:16.469969

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

In an Aug. 7 interview on EWTN News, the Trump administration is working on a “standalone process” for religious workers in the employment-based fourth preference (EB-4) category, separate from other applicants such as minors in the Special Immigrant Juvenile program.

The EB-4 backlog ballooned after Congress added juveniles to the category in 2023, extending green card wait times to more than five years. Religious workers typically come to the United States on temporary R-1 visas, which expire after five years. The delay means many must leave the country before their green card applications are processed, disrupting ministries and forcing congregations to seek replacements.

“We don’t want to read headlines that some Catholic church had to close because it couldn’t get their priests here or some order closed because some nun couldn’t get here,” Rubio said. “We know it’s an issue and we’re committed to fixing it.”

Rubio did not outline specifics or a timeline for creating the “freeway” — a dedicated lane within the EB-4 category that would remove religious workers from competing with other applicants.

Meanwhile, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Tim Kaine, D-Va., have introduced the Religious Workforce Protection Act, which would keep clergy in the United States during the backlog but would not speed up green card processing.

The bill would amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow R-1 holders with pending EB-4 applications to remain beyond the current five-year cap, permit them to change employers without jeopardizing their applications, and waive the one-year foreign residency requirement for those who have already been forced to leave.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has urged Congress to pass the measure, calling it “desperately needed” to preserve the contributions of foreign-born religious leaders. Archbishop Timothy Broglio, USCCB president, said the bill would “ensure communities across our nation can continue to enjoy the essential contributions” of these workers.

But unlike Rubio’s proposed “standalone process,” the measure does not change EB-4 quotas or the underlying competition for visas.

The bill has been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and faces an uncertain path to passage. For now, Rubio’s promised structural fix exists only as an administration concept without legislative text. That leaves the religious community looking at two very different potential outcomes: one that tackles the backlog at its source, and another that manages — but does not eliminate — the wait.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rsc_!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F880e334e-a2c6-4293-b25d-342dbac7e229_1032x976.png",N,,2025-08-10 11:56:45.073463

Trump administration’s immigration actions are part of a broader political strategy, says UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura.

The administration’s approach is more intense and disciplined in its second term, with fewer restraints.

“The damage being done in the university setting is severe.” – Hiroshi Motomura

UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura, one of the nation’s leading scholars on immigration law, says the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration actions are part of a broader political strategy designed to reshape the country’s identity, instill fear in immigrant communities, and redefine who counts as an American — and that the second Trump administration is pursuing these goals with greater discipline, intensity and fewer restraints than in Trump’s first term.

“This is much more intense than what happened in the first Trump administration,” Motomura said. “I think that those restraints are not there.”

In an interview with Everyday Injustice, Motomura said the sheer scope of the administration’s executive orders — from enforcement crackdowns to attempts to narrow birthright citizenship — reflects a “comprehensiveness” and “intensity” aimed at far more than changing specific laws.

“I think there’s a broader agenda to give voice to a certain conception of America,” he said. “The point of an initiative is not necessarily to see that initiative get upheld in court and enacted into law.”

Motomura, who has taught at UCLA, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Colorado, has spent nearly four decades studying immigration, citizenship, refugee, and asylum law. Beyond his academic work, he has been active in advocacy, including helping lead the campaign that resulted in the creation of DACA in 2012. He is the faculty co-director of UCLA’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy.

From his perspective, the administration’s messaging is as important as the policies themselves. He pointed to Trump’s push to reinterpret the Constitution to limit citizenship for children of noncitizens — an initiative he sees as unlikely to survive in court but highly effective as a political signal to supporters.

Similarly, he described mass deportation campaigns as serving a dual purpose: removing people and creating “concern, anxiety, fear, even terrorize some immigrant communities.”

In Motomura’s view, Trump’s second term has been far more organized. The first time around, he said, the administration included “traditional Republican voices” who sometimes pushed back on immigration proposals over concerns about family separation or economic fallout. That internal resistance is gone.

“When Trump lost in 2020, there are people who stuck with him… and there are people, for example, Stephen Miller… who was very much the hardest of the hardliners as far as I can tell on immigration issues,” Motomura said. Miller, now deputy chief of staff, “is in a position of much greater power in the second Trump administration.”

Motomura said the administration’s promises to deport millions inevitably lead to targeting citizens and legal residents.

“People who might be deportable… don’t walk around with a sign around their neck,” he said. The only way to produce those numbers, he argued, is to take shortcuts — such as racial profiling, language-based targeting, and neighborhood sweeps — and to limit due process through measures like expanded “expedited removal,” which allows deportations without a full immigration court hearing.

Many of those caught in enforcement dragnets, he said, have deep roots in the U.S. — people who have lived in the country for decades, raised families, and built their lives here.

He also stressed that decades of labor policy have “tolerated and even invited” undocumented workers, creating an economic reality in which millions live and work without legal status. Fixing the system, he said, requires not just legalization but “rethinking the categories and the ways people are brought to this country.”

Motomura challenged the popular image of undocumented immigration as mostly unauthorized border crossings.

“A significant percentage… did not sneak across the border,” he said. “They came in lawfully and for one reason or another, they stayed longer than they’re supposed to.”

That reality complicates the administration’s narrative and underscores the racial stereotypes in immigration enforcement. Undocumented immigrants include people from Europe, Asia, and around the world, he noted, yet public rhetoric still centers on Latin American migrants.

The current crackdown also goes beyond the undocumented, he said. The administration has targeted people with lawful status, including holders of Temporary Protected Status, a humanitarian designation Congress created for nationals of countries facing dire conditions.

Removing TPS from hundreds of thousands of people is a deliberate way to “get the numbers of deportable people up,” he said.

Universities have also been affected, with international students facing visa denials or restrictions that prevent them from completing degrees or taking jobs in the U.S.

The loss is not just educational but economic, Motomura said, as students contribute tuition revenue, fill teaching assistant positions, and spend money in local communities.

The approach reflects “a certain degree of extreme isolationism,” he said, signaling a disregard for higher education and global exchange. “The damage being done in the university setting is severe.”

Motomura linked disparate policies — from due process rollbacks to the use of the Alien Enemies Act — to a unifying narrative in which immigration is cast as a form of “invasion.”

“It’s no accident that the word invasion appears… in the executive orders,” he said. “That’s what justifies… that we can’t afford due process because we’re going to protect you from invaders.”

This framing also drives attempts to restrict birthright citizenship, which could strip citizenship from people born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents, including international students and businesspeople.

Motomura acknowledged that U.S. immigration law exists against a backdrop of conquest and displacement, from wars against Indigenous nations to the annexation of Mexican territory.

But he cautioned against assuming that recognizing those injustices means erasing national borders altogether.

He described himself as a “realistic utopian,” focused on incremental reforms that make the system fairer while keeping political change possible. That means recognizing history’s role — for example, in justifying asylum for Afghans who worked with U.S. forces or legalizing long-term residents whose labor was encouraged — but also navigating current political constraints.

“I’m focused on choices that are good choices and choices that are bad choices… that add up during a presidential administration or in a decade to make policy more fair than it is today,” he said.

Motomura sees economic dislocation as a driver of anti-immigrant sentiment, with political leaders channeling economic uncertainty into “racial anxiety or cultural anxiety.”

The immigrant rights movement, he said, has not always paid enough attention to economic injustice, leaving “fertile ground for people to swoop in and say, I’m for you and those other people are against you.”

Much of the economic pressure has little to do with immigration, he added, citing automation, weakened unions, and global trade shifts. But the U.S. has done “a poor job of really sharing wealth,” failing to invest in job retraining, education, and infrastructure that could ease displacement.

Motomura’s new book, Borders and Belonging: A Guide to Making Immigration Policy Ethical, is aimed at a general audience and distills decades of scholarship into a framework for understanding the legal, historical, and economic dimensions of immigration.

The 163-page book, he said, is intended to be “fair-minded,” taking opposing arguments seriously while offering principled responses. It covers topics from temporary versus permanent migration to the role of history in policy and the need for the immigrant rights movement to engage with economic inequality.

“It’s certainly the book I would give to someone from another planet if they landed in the United States and said, what is going on here,” he said.

For Motomura, the stakes in the immigration debate are not just about who gets to stay or go, but about the kind of country the U.S. chooses to be — and whether it uses law as a tool for inclusion or exclusion.

The UC Berkeley sophomore said international students should continue to consider their safety as well as their rights.","At UC Berkeley, a sophomore told CalMatters that she was involved in campus activism for about a year and a half until about March, when she saw international students losing their visas and heard rumors of immigration enforcement agents on campus. Her thoughts on protesting have changed drastically. “Everything I say can be used against me,” she said. She has been coming up with creative ways to be involved while trying to keep herself and other international students safe. For example, she participates in student club meetings, where she feels she can speak more privately.

“I came to the United States because those are things that I wasn’t comfortable doing in my country,” the sophomore said. “I wasn’t comfortable speaking out. It was like a dictatorship, and that’s why I came to America, which is, like, where the freedom is supposed to be. And then I got met with this. It’s really, really disappointing.”

Also at UC Berkeley, a junior from the UK said that last year she felt much freer. During the campus pro-Palestinian protests last year, she wanted to participate but was too busy. Her regret has now turned into relief because if anyone had taken a picture of her near a protest, she believes she would have suffered consequences.

“Under a Biden administration, I would have felt like I was free to criticize the administration. I was free to take part in protests,” she said. “Because of Trump’s recent decision — especially with the students at Columbia — I feel like I can’t be anywhere near a protest.”

An international graduate student at another UC — he does not want to name his campus in fear of not passing his dissertation — is working on a research project about the interplay of international politics and media. His research paper includes a section on human rights violations and genocide. Initially, he included coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Faculty advised him to remove the parts about Israel from his final project, he said.

“It does not have that big an impact on the entire project … but personally I’m just disappointed that I could not talk about it in my final events,” the graduate student said. “I will be presenting this to a set of faculty from my department, and they will be grading that, determining whether I can graduate or not based on the paper. It impacts a little bit on my department, and regarding freedom of speech.”

Balancing the support of Jewish students and due process

In his executive order, Trump promises to protect the civil rights of Jewish citizens, who have faced harassment, physical threats and assault on college campuses.

UC Irvine Jewish student Shir — who requested not to use her full name because she fears discrimination – believes if a student on a visa is “celebrating terror explicitly,” their student status should be evaluated. However, she notes the importance of drawing the line at terror and hate and not overstepping legal boundaries.

“Skipping [due] process doesn’t protect [against] antisemitism, it only creates more hate in the system,” Shir said in an email. “We are all humans first and should be treated as such.”

While she supports students’ right to protest, Shir wrote “there have been students repeating and glorifying slogans and ideas used by Hamas, a terrorist organization. This is where action is needed. I and many other Jewish students have been confronted at these protests and on campus, told I am a terrorist, that my family in Israel deserves to die, and had protesters outright justify Hamas’ actions to me.”

Raquel Aldana, a law professor at UC Davis, said the language being used by the Trump administration about antisemitism is extremely broad and could be read to include anything that is anti-Israel.

“One of the areas they’re going to be watching is how these institutions of higher learning respond to allegations of antisemitism, which could end up targeting foreign students,” Aldana said.

The Trump administration’s antisemitism task force is investigating allegations of antisemitic incidents at at least 10 college campuses across the country, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and the University of Southern California.

Aldana said she didn’t understand what problems the investigations are meant to address — adding that it “feels like a political move and not a true concern.”

International students limited on travel options

Three UC campuses that responded to CalMatters said they’ve sent communications to international students to use caution if they plan to travel outside the country.

Right before spring break, international students said they received travel warning emails from their international student offices about the risks of leaving the country. At UC Berkeley, the sophomore student said an email from the Berkeley International Office said the office could not guarantee international students’ ability to return to the U.S. if they left the country, even though the U.S. State Department’s website states continuing students may enter the country at any time.

“We had to spend our spring break in the U.S., [when] people want to go home,” the UC Berkeley sophomore said. “Not having that option is really disappointing, the fact that no one at the university can advocate for the small percentage of [international] students they have, … is insane to me.”

For the summer break, UC Berkeley’s International Office sent another email in May that urged “caution” for continuing international students who planned to travel out of the country. On June 4, the White House released a Presidential Proclamation announcing restrictions from 19 designated countries to enter the U.S. As a result, UC Davis and UC Irvine recommended that international students from those 19 countries not leave the U.S. because the travel ban may prevent them from re-entering.

Student newspapers face ethical dilemmas

Öztürk, the Tufts university student arrested after criticizing her university’s response to the Israel-Hamas war, returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release from a detention facility in Louisiana in May. Her arrest spurred college publications to take extra precautions.

Adalia Luo, editor-in-chief of UC San Diego’s student news organization The Guardian, and Chris Ponce, editor-in-chief of The California Aggie at UC Davis, said their opinion departments have been making changes. Luo said her organization has removed names from articles by international student writers upon request. Luo added that the priority is protecting the students even though removing a byline weakens a story’s credibility.

UC Davis’ student news staff has discussed a similar issue. Ponce said they’re not simply granting anonymity for anyone who asks. However, they are “now more than ever” open to removing whole articles if it means protecting the status of international students, which they are doing on a case-by-case basis.

One student newspaper is challenging the Trump administration’s policies regarding noncitizen students. The Stanford Daily, represented by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, is suing Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over immigration laws that allow the revocation of student visas for protected speech.

According to a letter from the editors, far fewer international students are willing to speak to The Daily, and those who do request anonymity. “Several international members of our own staff even left their positions at The Daily. Many of those who stayed requested to stop writing news articles related to protests or political events on campus and asked that their previous articles be taken off our website,” the letter states.

The junior at UC Berkeley said she writes for a campus political magazine. Once the Trump administration started targeting international students, she asked for the articles to be taken down, and the magazine obliged.

“I didn’t want my name affiliated with criticisms of the administration, as that would either risk me getting deported or a future visa being rejected. I believe the articles are still inaccessible, and my goal is that they remain so for the rest of Trump’s term,” the junior said.

Despite fears about sharing their viewpoints publicly, international students say it’s important to be advocates for themselves and each other.

The UC Berkeley sophomore said international students should continue to consider their safety as well as their rights.

“You should be taking precautions to keep your status and to keep yourself safe, but to also know that if we back down, change will never happen,” the sophomore said.

The facility was annocunced in March and began to receive the first 100 immigrants on Aug. 1.

The Fort Bliss ICE detention center is set to become a major deportation hub.

El Paso's Fort Bliss is set to become the site of the largest immigration detention facility in the United States, as the administration of Donald Trump expands its nationwide crackdown on immigration.

The detention center on the U.S. Army post began receiving the first of 1,000 detainees on Aug. 1, with around 100 individuals arriving at the new detention facility. El Paso's ICE spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa said in a news statement that the goal is to have 1,000 people detained in the facility by Aug. 17.

The Trump administration plans to expand the facility by 250 beds each week until it reaches 1,000. Ultimately, ICE looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility.

""We will finish construction for up to 5,000 beds in the weeks and months ahead,"" Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson told reporters on Aug. 7. ""Upon completion, this will be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission.""

ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility. Zamarripa said in the news statement that the facilities will provide detainees with access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation and medical treatment, among other services, which detainees receive in other facilities.

The Trump administration has stated that it will hold single adults who are scheduled for deportation. Immigrants held there are scheduled to be there for a short-term period before they are removed from the country.

The construction of the Fort Bliss detention facility expands ICE's capacity in the El Paso Sector, which stretches from New Mexico's border with Arizona through El Paso County. There are currently three other detention centers in the El Paso area, which includes an ICE detention facility and processing center on Montana Avenue, near the El Paso International Airport, as well as a facility north of the city on Highway 54 and another facility in Otero, New Mexico.

The three facilities can hold up to 3,000 people.

The El Paso Times has reached out to the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to tour the facility, but received no response to any media inquiries.

What do we know about the detention facility?

Former U.S. Secretary of the Army Daniel P. Driscoll announced that construction of the detention facility was imminent in March, following his visit to Fort Bliss and the El Paso area.

During the news conference, Fort Bliss Deputy Committee General Paul Krattiger said that the detention facility would be constructed at the location known as ""Site Monitor,"" which is just off of Montana Avenue and George Dieter Drive.

While the administration of President Donald Trump initially said the facility would hold up to 10,000 detainees, this number was reduced to 5,000.

The Henrico, Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics LLC company was awarded a $231,878,229 firm-fixed-price contract to establish and operate a detention facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The contract comes on the heels of Presidential Executive Order 14159, which outlines using ""national security assets for law and order.""

Military and commercial deportation flights

The Fort Bliss facility is meant to be a hub for the deportation of immigrants and to ease the capacity of centers across the country, ICE officials said.

""ICE is using Camp East Montana to help decompress ICE detention facilities in other regions,"" the statement said. ""It will also serve as a processing facility, and ICE Air Operations will effectuate removals for aliens staged at the facility.""

El Paso and Fort Bliss have continued to be the departure site of both military and ICE-chartered commercial deportation flights. Military deportation flights carry fewer deportees than commercial charters, but have a higher operating cost.

At least 68 military deportation flights have returned migrants to over a dozen countries since Jan. 24. Thirteen of the flights have departed Fort Bliss' Biggs Army Airfield, according to data compiled by Tom Cartwright with the immigration advocacy group Witness at the Border.

The majority of flights have transported immigrants to Guatemala, Honduras and Ecuador.

Concerns with congressional oversight

The construction of the ICE facility on Fort Bliss raises concerns for congressional oversight to uphold humane conditions at the immigration detention site.

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, has regularly carried out congressional oversight visits to the facilities, where she has sought to guarantee humane treatment of immigrants held in the detention centers. She was blocked from visiting the Montana Avenue facility in June 2025, leading to her filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

She has raised concerns over carrying out oversight at the Fort Bliss detention center.

""It is going to be very challenging to continue to provide oversight if we don't challenge the Trump administration in court,"" Escobar said at a news conference on July 30. ""The lawsuit is pretty critical, especially given the massive expansion of immigration detention that is going to happen as the result of Republicans giving tens of billions of dollars to private corporations.""

ICE detention facilities across the United States have faced accusations of inhumane conditions.

The ICE facility on Montana Avenue has faced criticisms over the conditions that immigrants face while in custody. Amnesty International raised concerns about the facilities in a report in May 2025, and U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Georgia, who reported immigrants being slammed to the ground by guards at the Montana Avenue center in a report on the abuse of pregnant women and children in ICE detention.

The Department of Homeland Security has refuted these claims.

Wisconsin Watch

A group of federal agencies announced in July that at least 15 federally funded health, education and social service programs would exclude undocumented immigrants and some who are living in the country legally.

Responding to President Donald Trump’s February executive order to “identify all federally funded programs currently providing financial benefits to illegal aliens and take corrective action,” the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Labor listed programs that provide literacy classes, career education, medical and mental health care, substance abuse treatment, free preschool and more.

In Wisconsin alone, the state Department of Justice estimates the new federal restrictions “put at risk more than $43 million each year in substance abuse and community mental health block grants that fund services in all 72 counties, 11 Tribal nations, and approximately 50 nonprofit organizations.”

Wisconsin Watch contacted more than a dozen Wisconsin organizations, government agencies and national experts to learn about the new policy’s effects. But we found more questions than answers. Most are unsure who is subject to the new rules or how to comply.

While we were reporting this story, Wisconsin joined 20 other states in a lawsuit challenging the new restrictions. That suit is still pending, but the parties have agreed to a deal that would delay most of the restrictions in those states until September.

Confusion created by the guidance could have serious consequences, experts say. Some providers might delay or cancel programs unnecessarily out of an abundance of caution, while some immigrants may avoid services for which they remain eligible, such as health care and education.

While much remains unclear, here’s what we know so far.

Which immigrants would be barred?

A 1996 law already prohibited certain immigrants from receiving 31 “federal public benefits,” including Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and cash assistance. The Trump administration’s new guidance bars the same immigrants from additional programs, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Those ineligible include:

● People with Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

● People with nonimmigrant visas, such as student visas, work visas and U visas for survivors of serious crimes.

● People who have pending applications for asylum or a U visa.

● People granted Deferred Enforced Departure or deferred action. This includes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients — those who entered the country as children.

● Undocumented immigrants.

● Lawfully present immigrants who don’t fall into categories below.

People in the following groups would remain eligible:

● Lawful permanent residents (green card holders).

● Refugees.

● People who have been granted asylum or withholding of removal.

● Certain survivors of domestic violence.

● Certain survivors of trafficking.

● Certain Cuban and Haitian nationals.

● People residing under a Compact of Free Association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Why the confusion?

A range of institutions — including colleges, government agencies and nonprofits — manage the affected programs. Many did not previously check the immigration status of the people they serve; creating a process to do so may add costs and logistical challenges. It could prove especially daunting for organizations like soup kitchens and homeless shelters, which provide urgent services to people without easy access to documents.

Meanwhile, entities that administer these federal funds include nonprofits and federally funded community health centers, which operate under laws that conflict with the guidance.

Health and Human Services said its settlement with the suing states “will permit the agency to consider, as appropriate, whether to provide additional information” about the restrictions it announced.

How would the changes affect health care in Wisconsin?

Wisconsin has 16 federally qualified community health centers serving patients at 217 sites. They receive money from Congress to provide primary care to all, regardless of their ability to pay. Nationally, such clinics serve more than 32 million patients, making up 1 in 10 people in the United States and 1 in 5 people in rural America, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers.

Aside from emergency rooms, they are often the only care options for undocumented immigrants or those with limited English proficiency, said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a national nonprofit providing information on health issues.

Federal law requiring those clinics to accept “all residents of the area served by the center” contradicts the Trump administration guidance.

The national association said in a July 10 statement that it’s working with experts and legislators to understand the impact of the new rules and ensure centers “have the information and resources needed” to continue serving their patients.

Access Community Health Centers, a nonprofit that provides medical, dental and mental health care at five south central Wisconsin clinics, will make “adjustments” if further federal guidance comes, CEO Ken Loving said.

“We don’t have the information we need to understand how this is going to impact us and how we can adapt to help our patients,” he said.

How would the changes affect education in Wisconsin?

The new restrictions target adult education services under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act and career and technical education services under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. Community and technical colleges would likely face the brunt of the impact, but just how much is unclear.

The Wisconsin Technical College System has followed 1997 guidance that said public benefit restrictions did not apply to such educational services, spokesperson Katy Petterson said. She’s not sure how the updated guidance might affect the system, which will “wait to learn the impact of the lawsuit.”

If community-college-operated programs begin checking immigration status, ineligible immigrants may remain able to take federally funded classes through nonprofits that are subject to different rules.

The nation’s 1,600 Head Start agencies, which provide free early childhood education and family support services for low-income families, fall under the restrictions announced in the Department of Health and Human Services notice. But the document doesn’t say whether Head Start staff must verify the immigration status of children, parents or both.

“It’s very ambiguous about who this impacts. … If you read the language, it’s 26-plus-ish pages of legal jargon, and it’s shifting,” said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, which supports the state’s roughly 300 Head Start service sites.

One thing Mauer wants families to know: Children already enrolled in Head Start won’t be forced out.

“We want to follow the rules, but Head Start is not required to redetermine eligibility,” Mauer said, noting it has never been required to do so in 60 years. She’s been telling the center directors to sit tight, even as worried parents ask questions.

One entity that won’t start checking immigration status: K-12 schools. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that denying education to undocumented students violated their constitutional rights.

Must nonprofit providers start checking immigration status?

Probably not. The 1996 law restricting public benefits says nonprofit charities are not required to “determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.”

At Literacy Network, a nonprofit offering a variety of free ESL and basic education classes in Madison, staff aren’t planning changes based on the new rule.

“It could certainly impact many of our students in other areas of their lives and therefore their ability to participate in our programs, but not who we can serve,” spokesperson Margaret Franchino said.

Still, guidance from the Department of Education is vague. It states that the exemption for nonprofits is “narrowly crafted,” and “the Department does not interpret (it) to relieve states or other governmental entities … from the requirements to ensure that all relevant programs are in compliance.”

Ryan Graham is the homeless systems manager at Wisconsin Balance of State Continuum of Care, a nonprofit that supports agencies responding to homelessness across most of the state.

As his agency discusses updates with partner agencies, it is preparing for an “increased administrative burden on already stretched staff.”

“We don’t yet know whether there will be delays caused by having to check or validate someone’s citizenship status, especially in emergency situations where time is critical,” Graham said.

When do the new rules take effect?

The notices published in July took effect immediately, though some federal agencies said they would likely not enforce them for about a month. The Trump administration later agreed to pause enforcement until Sept. 3 in the 21 states that sued.

The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, has voluntarily stayed enforcement of its directive in all states until Sept. 10.

What is the basis of legal challenges?

The multistate lawsuit argues the Trump administration failed to follow proper procedures in implementation and that it can’t retroactively change the rules after states accept grants to administer programs. Requirements to check the immigration status of every person served would unreasonably burden program staff and possibly force programs to close, the states argue.

States “will suffer continued, irreparable harm if forced to dramatically restructure their social safety nets and render them inaccessible to countless of the States’ most vulnerable residents,” the plaintiffs wrote.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Head Start groups nationwide had already sued before the Trump administration published new guidance. That suit argued staffing cuts, funding delays and bans on diversity efforts threatened to destabilize Head Start — a long-standing, congressionally mandated program. A hearing in that suit was held Aug. 5 on a request to temporarily block the Health and Human Services notice.

What does the Trump administration say?

The 1996 public benefits ban exempted federal programs that offered services available to all people on the grounds that they were “necessary for the protection of life and safety.”

Trump calls that exemption too broad.

“A surge in illegal immigration, enabled by the previous Administration, is siphoning dollars and essential services from American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly strained,” the White House said.

Citing studies from congressional committees and groups that seek to severely curtail immigration, the White House argues that allowing broad access to federal resources incentivizes illegal immigration and costs U.S. taxpayers. The recent federal spending package also eliminated access to Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps for some authorized immigrants, including refugees and asylees.

Trump ran for office on a promise to carry out mass deportations, and the bureaucratic moves appear to be a new frontier in that immigration crackdown. Since he took office, the administration has raided stores and workplaces, built new detention centers and attempted to shut down the asylum process at the southern border. It has also urged many immigrants without permanent legal status, including DACA recipients, to self-deport.

Why does this policy change matter?

Experts worry the confusion about the new rule could have a chilling effect, leading even eligible immigrants to stop using services.

Pillai of KFF noted that the restrictions on community health centers, alongside congressionally approved changes “that limit health coverage to a smaller group of lawfully present immigrants,” will likely make immigrant families even more reluctant to seek health care and social services.

The changes “may increase their reliance on emergency room care, which can be more costly in the long term,” she added.

Graham, the homeless systems manager, believes the Trump change will create “a direct barrier to safe and stable shelter for undocumented individuals and mixed-status families” and qualified immigrants or citizens who “may not have identification or the means to attain identification after fleeing a dangerous situation or crisis.”

It could also prompt administrators of some programs not covered by the rule to start screening participants as a precaution, or shut down programs to avoid screening challenges.

That has happened before. When Trump issued an executive order in January saying the administration would no longer “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender-affirming health care for people under 19, some providers stopped offering those services even though state law protected them.

Likewise, a 2023 KFF study found that in states that institute abortion bans, the majority of health care providers say they worry about accidentally running afoul of the law.

Braden Goetz, who worked for more than 20 years in the U.S. Department of Education and now works as a senior policy adviser at the New America Foundation’s Center on Education and Labor, said it’s unusual for federal guidance to be so sparse and ambiguous.

“​​Maybe that’s the intention: to confuse people and chill services to people who are not citizens or not legal permanent residents, and scare people,” Goetz said.

Trump’s grievances with Big Law stem partly from its role in blocking his first-term agenda.
Big Law, with its deep ranks of attorneys and paying clients to subsidize their volunteer work, is in a unique position to help.
Good-government groups and small and mid-sized law firms have stepped into the breach, helping to file hundreds of lawsuits against the Trump administration.
But until they build up the capacity to fully replace Big Law, Bonds said, some of the administration’s legally dubious actions will go unchallenged.","Two weeks into President Donald Trump’s second presidency, and just days after he pardoned hundreds of Capitol rioters, officials Trump had placed in charge of the Justice Department made a sweeping demand. They wanted the names of the thousands of FBI employees who had played a role in investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.

Fearing mass firings, or worse, retaliation by the people they helped prosecute, a group of agents scrambled to enlist a legal team who could stop the administration in court. Norm Eisen, a prominent ethics lawyer now leading dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration, agreed within hours to represent the agents pro bono, along with Mark Zaid, a veteran whistleblower attorney. For more firepower, the two approached the giant Chicago-based law firm Winston & Strawn, which has a history of providing free representation to people and organizations that squared off against Trump’s first administration.

But Winston declined to represent the FBI agents, three people with knowledge of the matter said. It was one of several cases Winston turned down in quick succession, they added, that would have pitted the firm against an openly retributive president.

Some of the country’s largest law firms have declined to represent clients challenging the Trump administration, more than a dozen attorneys and nonprofit leaders told ProPublica, while others have sought to avoid any clients that Trump might perceive as his enemies. That includes both clients willing to pay the firms’ steep rates, and those who receive free representation. Big Law firms are also refusing to take on legal work involving environmental protections, LGBTQ+ rights and police accountability or to represent elected Democrats and federal workers purged in Trump’s war on the “deep state.” Advocacy groups say this is beginning to hamper their efforts to challenge the Trump administration.

Their fears intensified after Trump signed a battery of executive orders aimed at punishing top firms over old associations with his adversaries. But as the Winston episode shows, Big Law began to back away from some clients almost the minute he returned to power. The country’s top firms remain deeply wary, even though the president has lost all four initial court challenges to those executive orders.

“The President’s Policy is working as designed,” said a lawsuit the American Bar Association filed against the administration in June. “Even as federal judges have ruled over and over that the Law Firm Orders are plainly unconstitutional, law firms that once proudly contributed thousands of hours of pro bono work to a host of causes — including causes championed by the ABA — have withdrawn from such work because it is disfavored by the Administration.”

The bar association itself has struggled to find representation, the lawsuit said. One unnamed firm, which has represented the association since the 1980s in lawsuits related to ABA’s accreditation of law schools, “is no longer willing to represent the ABA in any litigation against or potentially adverse to the Administration and its policies.” Sidley Austin, the sixth-ranked corporate firm by revenue in the world, has represented the ABA in at least five lawsuits over its accreditation practices since 1989.

The ABA and Susman Godfrey, which is representing the association in its lawsuit against the administration, declined to comment. Winston, Sidley and the White House did not respond to questions sent in writing.

Trump’s grievances with Big Law stem partly from its role in blocking his first-term agenda. In his executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a firm with close ties to the Democratic Party that fought Trump on transgender rights and immigration, he assailed the firm for allegedly “abus[ing] its pro bono practice to engage in activities that undermine justice.” Another firm, WilmerHale, was where former Special Counsel Robert Mueller worked before and after leading the Russian interference investigation.

The executive orders barred attorneys working for the firms from entering federal buildings where they represent clients, terminated the firms’ government contracts, revoked partners’ security clearances and required government contractors to disclose if they work with the targeted firms. Perkins Coie, one of Trump’s first targets, began to lose business “within hours,” its suit said. The judge who halted the executive order against WilmerHale wrote that the firm “faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.”

“I just think that the law firms have to behave themselves,” Trump said at a press conference in late March.

Nine corporate law firms behaved themselves in the form of reaching public settlements with Trump. The deals require them to provide $940 million in total of pro bono support for Trump-approved causes. There has been no public indication of the White House calling on them to perform specific work, and Trump has not released any new executive orders against firms since April.

Yet organizations that challenge the government are still feeling the chill.

“There’s been a real, noticeable shift,” said Lauren Bonds, the executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, a national nonprofit that brings lawsuits over alleged police abuse and was a frequent pro bono client of Big Law.

In November, as soon as Trump won reelection, a top firm that was helping NPAP develop a lawsuit against a city’s police force abruptly stopped attending all planning calls, Bonds said. Later, the firm became one of the nine that struck a deal with Trump, after which the firm half-heartedly told Bonds, she said, that it would reconsider the case in the future. Bonds declined to identify the firm.

Activist nonprofits have long relied on free representation because they typically lack the resources to mount major lawsuits on their own. Civil rights cases in particular are complex undertakings usually lasting years. Many call for hundreds of hours spent deposing witnesses and performing research, as well as upfront costs of tens of thousands of dollars. Big Law, with its deep ranks of attorneys and paying clients to subsidize their volunteer work, is in a unique position to help. In exchange, the work burnishes the firm’s reputation and serves as a draw for idealistic young associates.

“I know that [cases] have been shot down that in Trump Administration 1, firms would crawl over each other to get our name at the top of the case so that we could get the New York Times headline,” said a Big Law partner whose firm has not been one of Trump’s targets. “That’s the environment. What’s become radioactive has grown from a very small number of things to anything this administration and Trump might notice and get angry about.”

Jill Collen Jefferson, the president and founder of Julian, a small nonprofit that investigates civil rights violations, has felt the chill too.

Three years ago, Julian partnered with the elite law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the country’s No. 1 corporate firm most years by per-partner revenue, to bring lawsuits against the town of Lexington, Mississippi, and its police force for racial discrimination.

“It wasn’t hard at all to get help,” she recalled. George Floyd’s death had raised public support for police accountability, and the details Julian was exposing in Lexington were especially grim. The police chief was secretly recorded promising to cover for a fellow officer if he killed someone “in cold blood.” A DOJ investigation released in 2024 found Lexington police operated in “a system where officers can relentlessly violate the law.” (The town’s board fired the chief, Sam Dobbins, over the recording. In a court filing, Dobbins said he was not guilty of “any actionable conduct” and denied Julian’s characterization of the recording, asserting that “the recording speaks for itself.” Julian’s litigation is still ongoing.)

Since January, when Trump began gutting police accountability measures, Jefferson’s efforts to recruit pro bono help have yielded almost no commitments. The official explanation many firms offer is that they lack the capacity to help, she said, though lawyers at those firms have privately told her that was false. Wachtell did not respond to a request for comment.

Jefferson now doubts Julian’s ability to bring a police abuse lawsuit it had planned to file before the statute of limitations expires this month.

“It’s been a nightmare,” she said. “People don’t want to stand up, and because of that, people are suffering.”

NPAP ultimately joined forces with another civil rights organization to salvage the case after its co-counsel disappeared from planning calls last November. But the suit will be “less robust” without the firepower of a major law firm, Bonds said. And NPAP’s capacity to file future suits is in question. Civil rights attorneys in NPAP’s network have developed novel legal theories for challenging arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement under state constitutions, but they lack enough outside partnerships.

“There are cases that aren’t being brought at a time when civil rights abuses are maybe at the highest they’ve been in modern times,” Bonds said.

Big Law was often in the vanguard of fighting Trump’s first administration. After he signed the 2017 travel ban affecting several predominantly Muslim countries, partners from Kirkland & Ellis and Davis Polk rushed alongside hundreds of other lawyers to international airports to help travelers stuck in limbo. Kirkland teamed up with the LGBTQ+ legal advocacy organization Lambda Legal to challenge Trump’s transgender military ban.

Now, Davis Polk is among the many firms that are avoiding pro bono immigration cases, The New York Times reported. Kirkland, by some measures the top moneymaker in Big Law, entered a deal with Trump to provide $125 million in pro bono work, and the firm is notably absent from Lambda’s nearly identical challenge to Trump’s reinstated ban on transgender military service members. Kirkland and Davis Polk did not respond to requests for comment.

Winston & Strawn’s annual pro bono reports show how its focus — or at least, its language — has changed. The firm’s 2023 impact report highlighted its advocacy on behalf of a transgender competitive marathoner. “I am also pleased to report that Winston dedicated 30% of our pro bono hours to racial justice and equity matters in 2023,” nearly double its share in 2020, wrote Angela Smedley, the pro bono committee chair. The 2024 report, published after Trump’s reelection, contained zero mentions of “equity” and spotlighted attorneys who helped small nonprofits navigate “complex mergers and business challenges.”

Eisen and Zaid, the lawyers representing the FBI agents, themselves became the target of a presidential memorandum in March that revoked their access to classified material. Both have aggravated Trump for years. Zaid represented a whistleblower who helped bring about Trump’s first impeachment.

Zaid sued to restore his security clearance in May, in a case that is ongoing. His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, is a high-profile defense attorney who left Winston this spring in order to form his own firm. Lowell said his goal is to represent those “unlawfully and inappropriately targeted.” New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a fraud judgment against Trump and is now a target of his DOJ, was one of his first clients.

“The Administration’s attempt at retribution against Mark for doing his job — representing whistleblowers without regard to politics — is as illegal as its similar efforts against law firms that have been enjoined in every case,” Lowell wrote in an email to ProPublica.

Good-government groups and small and mid-sized law firms have stepped into the breach, helping to file hundreds of lawsuits against the Trump administration. And the four firms that sued Trump over his executive orders are devoting thousands of pro bono hours to others challenging the administration. Perkins Coie, for example, has replaced Kirkland as Lambda Legal’s partner in challenging Trump’s transgender military ban.

But until they build up the capacity to fully replace Big Law, Bonds said, some of the administration’s legally dubious actions will go unchallenged.

“There’s a financial resources piece that we’re really missing when we can’t engage a firm,” Bonds said. “Even if there’s a big case and we feel really confident about it, we’ll just have to pass on it.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2203683467-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 12:59:41.100097

This means that ICE and other federal immigration officers are no longer allowed to identify themselves as local police or use deceptive tactics during home arrests in Southern California.","Border Patrol agents took at least seven people during multiple immigration raids at Home Depots in Van Nuys on Friday, federal authorities confirmed Saturday.

Videos posted to Instagram by @valleyviewssfv showed at least two raids taking place in Home Depot parking lots on Friday morning, where a large presence of masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear arrested workers and took them away in unmarked vehicles.

The Department of Homeland Security later told KTLA that the seven detainees were from Guatemala, Mexico and Honduras. The first raid was reported around 7:15 a.m. by local leaders, and the second around 11:30 a.m.

Later Friday morning, Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey P. Horvath took to X to express distaste for the federal government’s tactics in immigration arrests.

“This morning in Van Nuys, several of our neighbors were forcibly taken by ICE. ICE agents showed no warrants & car windows were smashed,” said Horvath. Federal officials did not confirm or comment on the supervisor’s claim about property damages.

Horvath’s post went on to add, “The Trump administration is defying a court order to stop terrorizing our immigrant communities. It is heartbreaking, it is lawless, and it must end.”

On Aug. 4, the settlement of a class action lawsuit challenging federal immigration home arrest practices in L.A. was approved by a U.S. District Court judge. This means that ICE and other federal immigration officers are no longer allowed to identify themselves as local police or use deceptive tactics during home arrests in Southern California. In addition, agents may not claim to be conducting criminal investigations, probation or parole checks, or other public safety inquiries unless those claims are accurate.

Disputing claims of targeting people based on their skin color, race or ethnicity during these raids, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, “What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.”

The federal government did not comment on the tactics used in the arrests on Friday, but videos show the agents wearing vests that say “POLICE” and “U.S. BORDER PATROL,” along with their common use of masks and unmarked vehicles.

Friday’s raids came just two days after federal agents conducted an operation dubbed “Trojan Horse” at a Los Angeles Home Depot parking lot, where they used a Penske rental truck to disguise their presence before popping out and arresting 16 individuals.

In response to the Aug. 6 raid, Home Depot provided KTLA with a statement that read, “We aren’t notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and we’re not involved in them. In many cases, we don’t know that arrests have taken place until after they’re over. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

DHS indicated the Wednesday raid was in response to MS-13 gang activity in the area.

“America’s brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists—truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities,” said McLaughlin. She also noted that, on Friday, “Of the 7 detainees 4 had criminal records spanning from multiple DUIs, arrest for disorderly conduct (prostitution), failure to appear for removal (ICE fugitive), and a prior removal.”

The American Civil Liberties Union and Head Start groups nationwide had already sued before the Trump administration published new guidance.
That’s because Head Start programs aren’t required to redetermine eligibility, according to Wisconsin Head Start Association executive director Jennie Mauer.","The rules seek to bar certain immigrants from accessing Head Start, health clinics, career training, substance abuse treatment and more. Much is still unclear, but here’s what we know so far.

A group of federal agencies announced in July that at least 15 federally funded health, education and social service programs would exclude undocumented immigrants and some who are living in the country legally.

Responding to President Donald Trump’s February executive order to “identify all federally funded programs currently providing financial benefits to illegal aliens and take corrective action,” the departments of Education, Health and Human Services, Justice and Labor listed programs that provide literacy classes, career education, medical and mental health care, substance abuse treatment, free preschool and more.

In Wisconsin alone, the state Department of Justice estimates the new federal restrictions “put at risk more than $43 million each year in substance abuse and community mental health block grants that fund services in all 72 counties, 11 Tribal nations, and approximately 50 nonprofit organizations.”

Wisconsin Watch contacted more than a dozen Wisconsin organizations, government agencies and national experts to learn about the new policy’s effects. But we found more questions than answers. Most are unsure who is subject to the new rules or how to comply.

While we were reporting this story, Wisconsin joined 20 other states in a lawsuit challenging the new restrictions. That suit is still pending, but the parties have agreed to a deal that would delay most of the restrictions in those states until September.

Confusion created by the guidance could have serious consequences, experts say. Some providers might delay or cancel programs unnecessarily out of an abundance of caution, while some immigrants may avoid services for which they remain eligible, such as health care and education.

While much remains unclear, here’s what we know so far.

Which immigrants would be barred?

A 1996 law already prohibited certain immigrants from receiving 31 “federal public benefits,” including Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and cash assistance. The Trump administration’s new guidance bars the same immigrants from additional programs, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

Those ineligible include:

People with Temporary Protected Status (TPS).

People with nonimmigrant visas, such as student visas, work visas and U visas for survivors of serious crimes.

People who have pending applications for asylum or a U visa.

People granted Deferred Enforced Departure or deferred action. This includes Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients — those who entered the country as children.

Undocumented immigrants.

Lawfully present immigrants who don’t fall into categories below.

People in the following groups would remain eligible:

Lawful permanent residents (green card holders).

Refugees.

People who have been granted asylum or withholding of removal.

Certain survivors of domestic violence.

Certain survivors of trafficking.

Certain Cuban and Haitian nationals.

People residing under a Compact of Free Association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Why the confusion?

A range of institutions — including colleges, government agencies and nonprofits — manage the affected programs. Many did not previously check the immigration status of the people they serve; creating a process to do so may add costs and logistical challenges. It could prove especially daunting for organizations like soup kitchens and homeless shelters, which provide urgent services to people without easy access to documents.

Meanwhile, entities that administer these federal funds include nonprofits and federally funded community health centers, which operate under laws that conflict with the guidance.

Health and Human Services said its settlement with the suing states “will permit the agency to consider, as appropriate, whether to provide additional information” about the restrictions it announced.

How would the changes affect health care in Wisconsin?

Wisconsin has 16 federally qualified community health centers serving patients at 217 sites. They receive money from Congress to provide primary care to all, regardless of their ability to pay. Nationally, such clinics serve more than 32 million patients, making up 1 in 10 people in the United States and 1 in 5 people in rural America, according to the National Association of Community Health Centers.

Aside from emergency rooms, they are often the only care options for undocumented immigrants or those with limited English proficiency, said Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a national nonprofit providing information on health issues.

Federal law requiring those clinics to accept “all residents of the area served by the center” contradicts the Trump administration guidance.

The national association said in a July 10 statement that it’s working with experts and legislators to understand the impact of the new rules and ensure centers “have the information and resources needed” to continue serving their patients.

Access Community Health Centers, a nonprofit that provides medical, dental and mental health care at five south central Wisconsin clinics, will make “adjustments” if further federal guidance comes, CEO Ken Loving said.

“We don’t have the information we need to understand how this is going to impact us and how we can adapt to help our patients,” he said.

The new restrictions target adult education services under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act and career and technical education services under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act. Community and technical colleges would likely face the brunt of the impact, but just how much is unclear.

The Wisconsin Technical College System has followed 1997 guidance that said public benefit restrictions did not apply to such educational services, spokesperson Katy Petterson said. She’s not sure how the updated guidance might affect the system, which will “wait to learn the impact of the lawsuit.”

If community-college-operated programs begin checking immigration status, ineligible immigrants may remain able to take federally funded classes through nonprofits that are subject to different rules.

The nation’s 1,600 Head Start agencies, which provide free early childhood education and family support services for low-income families, fall under the restrictions announced in the Department of Health and Human Services notice. But the document doesn’t say whether Head Start staff must verify the immigration status of children, parents or both.

“It’s very ambiguous about who this impacts. … If you read the language, it’s 26-plus-ish pages of legal jargon, and it’s shifting,” said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, which supports the state’s roughly 300 Head Start service sites.

One thing Mauer wants families to know: Children already enrolled in Head Start won’t be forced out.

“We want to follow the rules, but Head Start is not required to redetermine eligibility,” Mauer said, noting it has never been required to do so in 60 years. She’s been telling the center directors to sit tight, even as worried parents ask questions.

One entity that won’t start checking immigration status: K-12 schools. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that denying education to undocumented students violated their constitutional rights.

Must nonprofit providers start checking immigration status?

Probably not. The 1996 law restricting public benefits says nonprofit charities are not required to “determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant for such benefits.”

At Literacy Network, a nonprofit offering a variety of free ESL and basic education classes in Madison, staff aren’t planning changes based on the new rule.

“It could certainly impact many of our students in other areas of their lives and therefore their ability to participate in our programs, but not who we can serve,” spokesperson Margaret Franchino said.

Still, guidance from the Department of Education is vague. It states that the exemption for nonprofits is “narrowly crafted,” and “the Department does not interpret (it) to relieve states or other governmental entities … from the requirements to ensure that all relevant programs are in compliance.”

Ryan Graham is the homeless systems manager at Wisconsin Balance of State Continuum of Care, a nonprofit that supports agencies responding to homelessness across most of the state.

As his agency discusses updates with partner agencies, it is preparing for an “increased administrative burden on already stretched staff.”

“We don’t yet know whether there will be delays caused by having to check or validate someone’s citizenship status, especially in emergency situations where time is critical,” Graham said.

When do the new rules take effect?

The notices published in July took effect immediately, though some federal agencies said they would likely not enforce them for about a month. The Trump administration later agreed to pause enforcement until Sept. 3 in the 21 states that sued.

The Department of Health and Human Services, meanwhile, has voluntarily stayed enforcement of its directive in all states until Sept. 10.

What is the basis of legal challenges?

The multistate lawsuit argues the Trump administration failed to follow proper procedures in implementation and that it can’t retroactively change the rules after states accept grants to administer programs. Requirements to check the immigration status of every person served would unreasonably burden program staff and possibly force programs to close, the states argue.

States “will suffer continued, irreparable harm if forced to dramatically restructure their social safety nets and render them inaccessible to countless of the States’ most vulnerable residents,” the plaintiffs wrote.

The American Civil Liberties Union and Head Start groups nationwide had already sued before the Trump administration published new guidance. That suit argued staffing cuts, funding delays and bans on diversity efforts threatened to destabilize Head Start — a long-standing, congressionally mandated program. A hearing in that suit was held Aug. 5 on a request to temporarily block the Health and Human Services notice.

What does the Trump administration say?

The 1996 public benefits ban exempted federal programs that offered services available to all people on the grounds that they were “necessary for the protection of life and safety.”

Trump calls that exemption too broad.

“A surge in illegal immigration, enabled by the previous Administration, is siphoning dollars and essential services from American citizens while state and local budgets grow increasingly strained,” the White House said.

Citing studies from congressional committees and groups that seek to severely curtail immigration, the White House argues that allowing broad access to federal resources incentivizes illegal immigration and costs U.S. taxpayers. The recent federal spending package also eliminated access to Medicaid, Medicare and food stamps for some authorized immigrants, including refugees and asylees.

Trump ran for office on a promise to carry out mass deportations, and the bureaucratic moves appear to be a new frontier in that immigration crackdown. Since he took office, the administration has raided stores and workplaces, built new detention centers and attempted to shut down the asylum process at the southern border. It has also urged many immigrants without permanent legal status, including DACA recipients, to self-deport.

Why does this policy change matter?

Experts worry the confusion about the new rule could have a chilling effect, leading even eligible immigrants to stop using services.

Pillai of KFF noted that the restrictions on community health centers, alongside congressionally approved changes “that limit health coverage to a smaller group of lawfully present immigrants,” will likely make immigrant families even more reluctant to seek health care and social services.

The changes “may increase their reliance on emergency room care, which can be more costly in the long term,” she added.

Graham, the homeless systems manager, believes the Trump change will create “a direct barrier to safe and stable shelter for undocumented individuals and mixed-status families” and qualified immigrants or citizens who “may not have identification or the means to attain identification after fleeing a dangerous situation or crisis.”

It could also prompt administrators of some programs not covered by the rule to start screening participants as a precaution, or shut down programs to avoid screening challenges.

That has happened before. When Trump issued an executive order in January saying the administration would no longer “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender-affirming health care for people under 19, some providers stopped offering those services even though state law protected them.

Likewise, a 2023 KFF study found that in states that institute abortion bans, the majority of health care providers say they worry about accidentally running afoul of the law.

Braden Goetz, who worked for more than 20 years in the U.S. Department of Education and now works as a senior policy adviser at the New America Foundation’s Center on Education and Labor, said it’s unusual for federal guidance to be so sparse and ambiguous.

“​​Maybe that’s the intention: to confuse people and chill services to people who are not citizens or not legal permanent residents, and scare people,” Goetz said.

Five things to know about the new public benefits rule

The rule bars some immigrants with legal status, as well as all undocumented immigrants. That includes people with TPS, DACA, guest worker visas or pending asylum applications.

Children already enrolled in Head Start can continue attending, regardless of their immigration status. That’s because Head Start programs aren’t required to redetermine eligibility, according to Wisconsin Head Start Association executive director Jennie Mauer.

Nonprofit charitable organizations appear to be exempt from the new requirement. That means immigrants barred from services under the new guidelines may still be able to get services through nonprofit organizations.

Community Health Centers are required by law to accept all people in their area. It’s not clear how the new rules, which state that these federally funded health centers should only be available to “qualified immigrants,” will work with that law.

The new rules do not affect access to K-12 education, which the U.S. Supreme Court has found to be a right of every child regardless of immigration status.",https://milwaukeecourieronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Children-play-during-aftercare-Head-Start-program-Easterseals-South-Florida.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 13:56:44.053873

We came to Ireland to save lives and now we’re scared to walk home after a shift,” it says.","In the west Dublin suburb of Tallaght, a group of teenagers accosted, beat and partially stripped an Indian man, who was then filmed staggering and bleeding. Days later a gang attacked another Indian man in the nearby suburb of Clondalkin, hitting him in the face, chest, back and legs, leaving him with a fracture, gashes and multiple bruises.

Days later again, two male passengers turned on an Indian taxi driver in the north Dublin suburb of Ballymun, striking him across the face with a bottle and shouting: “Go back to your country.”

Days later, boys in a County Waterford housing estate allegedly punched a six-year-old girl in the face, hit her in the genital area with a bicycle and told her: “Go back to India.”

These are just some of a spate of incidents in recent weeks that have sown alarm and bewilderment among the Indian community, and other immigrants, in Ireland. In each case police are investigating but no charges have yet been brought.

Indians held a silent protest outside the justice department and the Indian embassy in Dublin has urged its citizens to take security precautions and avoid deserted areas. Media in India have given prominent coverage to the assaults, a jolt to those from the country who had long considered Ireland a safe, welcoming destination.

“A fellow on a motorbike stopped and hit me in the face when I was stopped in traffic,” said a Dublin-based taxi driver from the state of Punjab, who declined to be named. “Why is this happening?”

Each new incident makes the question more urgent. Since the 1990s, immigration has transformed a once mono-ethnic country into one where a fifth of the population was born overseas. In recent years, anger over a lack of affordable homes has fuelled resentment towards immigrants and asylum seekers and led to protests, some violent. Thugs posted videos of attacks on tents with refugees from Africa and the Middle East.

Since June there has been a spate of brutal assaults on people from south Asia, many of whom have lived in Ireland for years and are taxi drivers, tech workers or medical professionals.

“We are accustomed to micro-aggressions,” said Fahmeda Naheed, a poet and human rights activist from Pakistan who has lived in Cork for 13 years. “We are seeing more physical assaults. It is more forceful and aggressive than in the past. It has coincided with the housing shortage and antisocial behaviour of the youth.”

Naheed called for improved policing and procedures to encourage victims to come forward, counselling, anti-racism education and hate crime legislation.

The far right remains a marginal political force but videos of anti-immigrant rallies are widely shared. A recent one shows a man in a playground telling a small crowd with Irish tricolours that immigrants are arriving who are not fit to work yet are buying property. “They’re never going to integrate either. Islam should never be allowed into a Christian country,” he said, prompting cheers.

Amal Women Ireland, a group that provides support to Muslim women, expressed alarm after what it called a “violent, racially motivated” assault on a colleague at a Dublin bus stop on 30 June.

An open letter posted on Reddit purportedly from an Indian nurse says the author and dozens of colleagues are thinking of quitting Ireland because of abuse and fear. It cites an incident in which Irish teenagers bullied and mocked an eight-year-old Indian girl. “What kind of place is this becoming? We came to Ireland to save lives and now we’re scared to walk home after a shift,” it says.

The letter is anonymous and the Guardian has not been able to verify the authenticity, but it has gone viral and amplified concern at racism and xenophobia.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cfac2fb1fbea33d7d510c0eb6b3052566c0bd71/560_0_5600_4480/master/5600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57ba93d79bfa901b27332c326d043736",N,,2025-08-10 04:56:17.565709

Attorneys from Innovation Law Lab and advocates from Oregon for All reported that the group was arrested around 6 a.m. on Aug. 7 after ICE agents stopped their van, allegedly breaking the driver's side window in the process.

Four workers—three men and one woman—were arrested , while two other women and a teenage girl were released.

KATU News has reached out to Portland's regional ICE spokesperson, who has declined to comment on pending litigation in the past.

Reyna Lopez, executive director of PCUN, Oregon’s farmworker union, criticized the actions of Immigration enforcement officers.

PAST ICE COVERAGE:

""ICE is terrorizing the very people who feed our communities, targeting farmworkers in their own neighborhoods on their way to work,"" Lopez said. ""These tactics will only scare folks from working during the peak harvest. This not only affects farmworkers’ ability to support their families, but also the many growers who rely on migrant labor and our collective ability to put food on our tables.""

The arrested workers are members of the Mam Nation, Indigenous to Guatemala, residing in Woodburn, according to a statement by Oregon for All.

Community members who witnessed the incident contacted the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) hotline, which mobilized community support as part of Oregon for All’s rapid response network.

Legal advocates from the Innovation Law Lab attempted to meet with the arrested group at the Portland ICE facility but were denied access.

""Imagine being arrested, unable to understand what’s happening, and cut off from legal help,"" said Puma Tzoc, director of the Collective of Indigenous Interpreters of Oregon at Pueblo Unido.

""As Mam speakers, these workers face additional barriers in understanding their rights and accessing legal help. This is a violation of their rights. We demand that they respect our Indigenous nations.""

Isa Peña, director of strategy at Innovation Law Lab, also expressed concern over ICE's actions.

""ICE's refusal to allow attorneys to speak with people who are detained violates basic due process rights,"" Peña said. ""We’re seeing a pattern: ICE acts with impunity, and communities are left to pick up the pieces.""

Attorneys managed to speak with the spouse of one of the workers and filed an emergency habeas corpus petition.

The worker, identified only as L-J-P-L-, is challenging his sudden detention by ICE without notice or explanation.

L-J-P-L- fled Guatemala after his brother was murdered and sought asylum in the United States.

READ ALSO:

He was released from immigration custody in Feb. 2024 and has complied with all legal requirements while pursuing his asylum claim. Despite this, he was arrested and arrested on Aug. 7 with no prior notice.

The petition argues that the detention and potential transfer of L-J-P-L- out of the district are arbitrary and violate his due process rights. It seeks to prevent his transfer and requests his release from custody.

The court has issued an order to show cause, requiring the respondents, including ICE officials and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to justify the detention by Aug. 13 of this year. A hearing is scheduled for Aug. 19.

The petition claims that the decision to revoke L-J-P-L-'s release was made without considering the individual facts of his case, constituting an abuse of discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act.

It also alleges that the detention violates the Fifth Amendment's due process clause.

RELATED:

Attorneys from Innovation Law are representing L-J-P-L-, and they argue that the detention is part of a broader pattern of using immigration detention as a punitive measure against asylum seekers.

This incident is not isolated. In June, the Oregon Farm Bureau raised concerns following similar ICE arrests in Yamhill County, warning that immigration enforcement threatens the state’s food supply.

Oregon’s agricultural sector relies heavily on immigrant labor. According to the American Immigration Council, and 61.9% of general farm laborers, performing tasks such as planting, hand harvesting, pruning, and packing.

Portland and the state of Oregon as a whole are both mentioned in the Department of Justice's

Last week, Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated, ""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design.""

She added that the Department of Justice will continue to pursue litigation against these jurisdictions and collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security to eliminate such policies nationwide.

Earlier this year in January, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson addressed the Portland City Council in a letter, expressing concern about the federal government's immigration enforcement plans.

Wilson stated that Portland is committed to its sanctuary city status, supported by Oregon's sanctuary state laws and the Sanctuary Promise Act of 2021.

""We must come together to live our city’s shared values of freedom from fear and sanctuary from federal overreach in the days ahead, no matter what our city may face,"" the letter read in part.

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek issued a similar statement this year.

And a couple of weeks ago, ICE agents showed up and they took away all the workers,” claims Randolph.
“We need to be concerned about retail businesses and restaurants at every level,” says Randolph.","(KRON) — As the Trump administration continues its push to have Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents remove undocumented immigrants from all walks of life, a recent study finds in addition to the human impact that Californians will also have an economic price to pay.

Many understand the human impact of the ramping up of ICE deportations. But these roundups are also starting to have a dramatic impact on the California economy.

“There’s a massive level of economic impact that can be expected if the federal government proceeds with deportations at a mass level, at the level that they’ve been talking about,” says Sean Randolph of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.

A report by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute says over a quarter of the state’s agricultural workforce is undocumented, and without them, the gross domestic product generated by them could drop by 14%.

“A 90-year-old woman who, with her husband, years ago, planted a 40-acre walnut grove, which they have tended for a long time. And a couple of weeks ago, ICE agents showed up and they took away all the workers,” claims Randolph.

Randolph says that crop will now go unharvested, as will others at California farms impacted by similar raids. The impact is not just to the workers and the farmers but those of us that buy those products.

“The pressure is going to be for prices to rise now that could be table grapes,” says Randolph. “Could be wine, it could be, certainly every kind of like almonds, walnuts, spinach, all the stuff we grow in the Central Valley, the Salinas Valley.”

The report also suggests the removal of undocumented immigrants takes away some 4.9 billion they pay in excise and sales taxes which will impact local economies and governments that provide services to everyone.

“We need to be concerned about retail businesses and restaurants at every level,” says Randolph. “A lot of them are still struggling coming out of the pandemic. And so, you take the revenue away from them, you’re taking sales tax away from city revenues. So again, it just cascades through the economy at various levels.”",https://www.kron4.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/08/Untitled-2.png?w=1280,N,,2025-08-10 01:56:24.083433

According to the Temple report, Moshannon’s rural location – where there is limited public transportation – and challenges scheduling visits limit immigrant families’ ability to make the journey.","PHILIPSBURG – Liseth Carvajal knelt in a pew at Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church in Philipsburg, Clearfield County, on Wednesday morning, fingers laced in prayer.

Three miles away, her husband, Jesus Teran, sat in a visiting room at Moshannon Valley Processing Center, the largest immigration detention center in the Northeast, separated by a plexiglass panel and netting from the Rev. Jay Donahue, senior parochial vicar at St. Oscar Romero Parish in Washington County, where Carvajal and Teran are members, and Erenia Karamcheti, the parish’s social worker.

Teran, 35, a civil engineer from Venezuela who works for a local carpenters union, was detained on July 8 while reporting to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Pittsburgh for a scheduled check-in. He was sent briefly to Northern Regional Jail in Moundsville, W.Va., before he was moved to Moshannon.

A detention hearing, slated for Aug. 14, will determine if the father of two can reunite with his family in their Imperial, Allegheny County, home, or if he will be deported.

“We’re hoping for a miracle and that Jesus can come home,” Donahue had said earlier in the day at a diner where he, Carvajal and Karamcheti ate breakfast before heading to see Teran for the first time in a month. “There is no humanity or dignity at all in the conditions the men and women are being forced to live in. These are human beings, and they’re being treated as if they’re less than that, wearing color-coded prison uniforms and sleeping in a room with 79 other people, with no privacy.

“We want to advocate for Jesus and the human beings in there. We’re dealing with a broken immigration system, and Jesus is being treated as if he is a dangerous felon, when in fact he was following the rules and doing everything he was supposed to do.”

A facility under fire

Moshannon, owned by the Florida-based GEO Group, is a private, for-profit facility that has faced numerous allegations of civil and human rights violations.

Multiple complaints have been filed against Moshannon, including a federal complaint last year by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and other civil rights advocates.

A report last fall, “In the Shadow of the Valley,” by law students at the Sheller Center for Social Justice at Temple University Beasley School of Law and the immigrant rights group Juntos, describes “inhumane, punitive and dangerous conditions” at Moshannon and calls for its closure.

Dr. Jennifer Lee, associate professor of law at Temple University who supervised the law school’s report alleging abuses at Moshannon, said detainees are not there because of a crime, but that many are asylum-seekers being detained while their immigration cases are being processed.

Teran, who came to the United States in 2021 seeking asylum to flee violence in Venezuela, has no criminal record.

According to data from TRAC (Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse), a data gathering organization founded at Syracuse University, as of July 27, 56,945 people were being held in ICE detention, and of those, 71.7% have no criminal conviction.

But the idea of who is considered a “criminal” has expanded to include most undocumented people, said Linda Hamilton, an immigration attorney from Peters Township and adjunct professor at University of Pittsburgh School of Law.

“What we are witnessing is a deliberate erosion of human rights and due process. People who have lived in the U.S. for decades while working, paying taxes, raising children, checking in with ICE, doing everything right, are now being rounded up and thrown into detention as if they’re a threat to public safety. This is not about protecting the public. This is about mass detention and fear-based policy.”

The Temple University report documents a range of alleged abuses, including insufficient medical and mental health care, the use of solitary confinement (TRAC data show an average of 147 people ended up in solitary confinement per month at Moshannon), inadequate access to translation services, due process violations, physical and psychological abuse, and little opportunity for religious practices.

There are no religious services for detainees like Teran, who attended Mass on Sundays at Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Church in Meadow Lands, where Donahue leads a Spanish worship service.

“I think it’s a huge human rights problem that they don’t have access to practice their religion in a processing center,” said Donahue, noting the facility does have a chaplain. “It’s outrageous that people like Jesus, who have no felony record at all, can’t practice their religion. He can’t receive Communion. I’ve been to all kinds of facilities before, and I was shocked. There are Muslims and Christians in there, and there’s really extremely limited access to any religious services or religious materials.”

Under heavy guard

GEO Group operates more than a dozen federal immigration detention centers across the country, and Moshannon is the ninth largest for-profit detention center in the U.S.

Moshannon served as a federal prison from 2006 until it closed in March 2021. It reopened in September of that year as an immigration detention facility after Clearfield County Board of Commissioners entered into a five-year contract with GEO Group and ICE.

According to the Temple University report and the Clearfield County commissioners’ annual budgets, ICE pays GEO about $3.4 million per month, which includes a daily rate per person that depends on the overall population of the facility. GEO pays the county $200,000 annually to operate.

An estimated 1,340 detainees are currently at Moshannon.

At facilities like Moshannon, additional fees that are paid per detained person can have an impact on the revenue generated.

Temple University’s Lee said “profit is certainly what drives some of this.”

“Private industry had a large hand in making and maintaining this detention system. Their profits matter,” she said.

Detainees are required to pay for phone calls (as much as 21 cents per minute for video calls, according to the Temple report) and additional food and snacks from accounts they can set up, and into which family and friends can deposit money.

“For people in immigration detention without bank accounts, credit cards, or other financial means, keeping in touch with family members becomes almost impossible,” the report concluded.

Pittsburgh Women for Democracy, whose members participated in a protest at Moshannon last month, contends that separating immigrants – including many who have lived in the U.S. for years and are primary breadwinners and parents of U.S.-born children – from their families, communities and jobs doesn’t make communities any safer.

The detention center sits atop a hill and is surrounded by an electric fence topped with barbed wire. Signs indicate drones are in use and armed guards greet vehicles approaching the facility.

“It is surreal. It’s intimidating,” said Megan Guidi, a member of Pittsburgh Women for Democracy. “It’s completely stark and desolate. We were all kind of shaken by it; everyone was completely silent. It was just unbelievable.”

In March, ICE conducted a compliance investigation, and Moshannon received a “Superior” rating, with the department finding zero deficiencies after reviewing 28 standards. But immigrant advocates and researchers are skeptical about the findings of the investigation, and the Temple report said government inspections contradict the reports of people detained there.

Civil rights groups have advocated for more humane alternatives to detention centers. Organizations such as the National Immigrant Justice Center are calling for implementing community-based services and alternatives to detention that cost a fraction of the billions spent on immigration incarceration and provide a pathway to citizenship.

“The ostensible reason for detention is, one to protect people, and we can dispel that because the vast majority of these folks are not dangerous,” said Lee. “And the other justification is risk of flight, a concern that people won’t show up for immigration hearings. But research shows that there are incredibly high rates of appearances at hearings.

“There are more humane and cheaper alternatives that work for the system and don’t require pulling them away from their families, locking them up and having to feed and house them. But our system is designed to punish. We have to remember their humanity, and that’s not happening.”

Efforts for immigration reform are stalled, with deep divisions between political parties on how to address immigration preventing any meaningful changes. ​​

A House bill from the 2023-24 session aimed at banning private correctional institutions and immigration detention centers did not pass.

More recently, U.S. Rep. Maria Salazar (R-Florida) introduced the Dignity Act, a bipartisan bill that aims for comprehensive immigration reform, such as granting legal status to some undocumented immigrants and providing protections for Dreamers.

Immigration advocates encourage people to contact their elected officials to demand reform.

‘They feel hopeless’

But while the battle for reform of the immigration detention system continues, detainees like Teran and their families suffer from the emotional toll of possible deportation and separation from their loved ones.

“The wait is the weight,” said Donahue. “The hardest thing is that there’s no end. There are people who are thinking, ‘In a week I’ll have my hearing,’ and then it doesn’t happen, and then they wonder, ‘When am I going to get out?'”

The day before Teran’s visitors arrived at Moshannon, a 32-year-old citizen of China died after he was found hanging by his neck in the shower room of his detention pod. The man had been in ICE custody for five days and was awaiting an immigration hearing. A handwritten note was found and his death was ruled a suicide.

One man who was in Teran’s pod decided to give up his fight to remain in the U.S. after the death and self-deported, Donahue said.

“A lot of people are losing hope here because their humanity is being stripped away. There’s no real due process – that’s being violated. They don’t have people to visit them. They can’t touch a person. They feel hopeless,” he said.

According to the Temple report, Moshannon’s rural location – where there is limited public transportation – and challenges scheduling visits limit immigrant families’ ability to make the journey.

Karamcheti estimates she called the facility at least 100 times to schedule a visit, to no avail. Then, last week, she made the three-hour drive to Moshannon and insisted in person on scheduling a visitation date.

Donahue and Karamcheti spent about two hours with Teran, and then Carvajal visited her husband for about two hours. She said she thought Teran – who was wearing a blue shirt assigned to detainees who are the lowest level of security threat and new eyeglasses that Karamcheti had dropped off on the day she scheduled the visit – had lost weight, but otherwise looked healthy.

Donahue and Teran prayed together, and the priest encouraged Teran to remain hopeful.

When Teran entered Moshannon, he was carrying a prayer card bearing the image of St. Charbel, a 19th century Lebanese monk renowned for his miracles and a symbol of hope and healing, that Donahue had given him days before he was arrested by ICE. The card was taken from Teran and is in his detainee file.

Donahue has prayed daily to St. Charbel for intercession, and he did so at 4 a.m. Wednesday, before he drove to Philipsburg.

When he arrived at Moshannon, with a St. Charbel card in his pocket, Donahue received good news: After three bond appeal denials, Teran finally was granted a bond hearing date before a New Jersey judge.

“Now, we see what happens, and we pray for one more miracle on Aug. 14,” said Donahue, who felt relief after seeing Teran. “It was good to see him. I couldn’t touch him. I couldn’t give him a hug. But that guy’s my man, and I was happy to see him.”

The church community has rallied around Carvajal and the couple’s children, Kamila, 14, and Lukas, 5. The St. Oscar Romero Knights of Columbus Council 3291 has launched a GoFundMe fundraiser https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-parish-families-in-their-time-of-need to help Carvajal, a stay-at-home mother, and other families who have lost their financial means.

The congregation created a prayer campaign on the Hallow app, and the family has received a strong show of support from staff and students at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart High School in Coraopolis, where Kamila is a freshman.

And parishioners are tending to the community garden that Teran helped to build at St. Oscar Romero’s St. Patrick Church in Canonsburg this spring as a way to bring together members of English- and Spanish-speaking members in the area.

Teran was described by Chris McAneny, the director of housing for the nonprofit Wellness Collective, which collaborated on the garden, as “the neighbor that everyone would want.”

Teran had been appearing at scheduled ICE appointments for more than four years, and following ICE protocols before he was arrested at the check-in.

Said Pitt’s Hamilton, “There’s no longer a distinction between someone with a clean record and someone with a serious conviction. It’s all being treated the same, as if being undocumented alone justifies indefinite incarceration. That’s not law enforcement; it’s cruelty disguised as policy.”

Donahue said Teran wanted to share a message.

“He asked me to please let people know that we are human beings. We’re hard-working men trying to help our families,” said Donahue. “He said, ‘I miss my family. We all just want to be home with our families.'”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/washington.ogdennews.com/images/sites/3/2025/08/08173152/Image-103-1-1200x928.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 04:56:22.144214

Trump has often been under investigation during his political career — a fact owing to his near-constant efforts to push boundaries. But perhaps the four biggest examples? The Russia investigation; his Ukraine impeachment; January 6, 2021; and his personal legal troubles after leaving office (including those stemming from January 6).

Less than seven months into Trump’s second term, key people from every one of these efforts have now apparently faced investigations of their own.

More than 10 people who played key roles in these investigations or ran afoul of Trump have faced some kind of significant legal scrutiny. These are steps that go beyond Trump merely accusing them of misdeeds or suggesting they should be probed.

Trump and top administration officials have also targeted foes with firings and stripped them of security clearances, but the effort to apply legal scrutiny to some of the most prominent adversaries appears to be ratcheting up.

Attorney General Pam Bondi earlier this week ordered a grand jury probe into allegations that key Obama administration officials manipulated intelligence in the Russia probe. On Friday came news that New York Attorney General Letitia James, who won a civil fraud case against Trump, faces her own grand jury probe. Reports indicate a similar effort has also targeted Sen. Adam Schiff of California, who figured prominently in two Trump investigations from the president’s first term.

Often, the allegations being investigated do not relate to the figures’ actions in probing Trump. Many of allegations remain unsubstantiated in the public record, like those about the Russia intelligence.

None of which means none of the people did anything wrong. There is plenty we don’t know.

But it would seem telling that key figures from each of these efforts have found themselves under scrutiny. What are the odds that happens — and so quickly — if this isn’t about retaliation and sending a message?

And even if the investigations don’t amount to anything, there is value for Trump in creating legal headaches for these people. It certainly sends a message to anyone who might to investigate him in the future.

Here’s a look at what we know, broken down by who investigated Trump for what.

The Russia investigation

Barack Obama, et al.: Bondi, earlier this week, ordered prosecutors to begin a grand jury probe into allegations that top Obama administration officials manufactured intelligence about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. The move followed the release of new documents from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that she and others have misconstrued and that don’t appear to shed much light beyond previous probes — including ones spearheaded by Republicans. Gabbard and Trump have gone so far as to suggest Obama himself committed treason.

Former FBI Director James Comey: We learned last month that the FBI was investigating Comey for possible false statements to Congress. Trump controversially fired Comey in 2 017 amid the FBI director’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and its possible ties to Trump’s campaign. The news of the investigation came after top Trump administration officials earlier this year strained to accuse Comey of calling for the president’s assassination.

Former CIA Director John Brennan: That FBI investigation also included Brennan, who played a key role in early assessments of Russia’s interference and whom Trump has regularly attacked.

January 6, 2021

Sen. Adam Schiff of California: The Justice Department is also probing Schiff, according to reports, for allegations of mortgage fraud. Those reports haven’t been confirmed by CNN, but Schiff’s lawyer Preet Bharara late Friday issued a statement calling the allegations “transparently false, stale, and long debunked.” Schiff managed Democrats in Trump’s first impeachment in 2019 when he was serving in the House and later chaired the House January 6 committee’s investigation of Trump. The news comes weeks after Trump called Schiff “a THIEF” and said, “He should be prosecuted.” Trump also said in December that Schiff and other January 6 committee members should be jailed. The allegations stem from a confidential Fannie Mae memo raising questions about the possibility of “occupancy misrepresentation” by Schiff, according to The Washington Post.

Liz Cheney: Shortly after the 2024 election, Trump urged the FBI to investigate Schiff’s co-chair of the January 6 committee, former Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican. In addition to saying January 6 committee members should be in jail, Trump promoted social media posts calling for Cheney to face a televised military tribunal. While there is no evidence of such an FBI investigation, House Republicans pressed forward with their own probe, focused on the idea that Cheney manipulated evidence in that investigation. That investigation has divided House Republicans, CNN reported in March.

The Ukraine impeachment

This category could also include Schiff, given he managed Trump’s first impeachment, which related to the president’s efforts to leverage Ukraine for political help in the 2020 election.

The Vindmans: Then-interim US Attorney Ed Martin earlier this year sent letters to Democratic Rep. Eugene Vindman of Virginia seeking information about a business Vindman and his brother, Alexander Vindman, founded to help arm Ukraine to fight Russia, according to The Washington Post. CNN has not reported on these letters. Before Eugene Vindman was elected to Congress, the Vindman brothers blew the whistle on Trump tying Ukraine aid to the country announcing an investigation into the Bidens, when Joe Biden was Trump’s campaign opponent. Trump has regularly attacked Alexander Vindman, whom former top administration official Elon Musk once called a “traitor.”

Trump’s personal legal cases

New York Attorney General Letitia James: James has faced investigations in multiple jurisdictions, including ones related to alleged mortgage fraud and her actions in investigating Trump. James successfully brought civil fraud charges against Trump in 2023, winning a verdict worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and brought multiple lawsuits against the first Trump administration. Trump has attacked James for years. Shortly before an investigation of James came to light in May, Trump called James “a total crook.”

Special counsel Jack Smith: The Office of Special Counsel, which is temporarily headed by a Trump appointee after the president fired its previous head, is investigating Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. (The Office of Special Counsel is separate from the kind of special counsel Smith served as.) That act limits political activities by government employees. Smith led the investigations and attempted federal prosecutions of Trump over January 6 and Trump’s decision to take classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021. Those cases resulted in indictments but did not go to trial after Trump was elected president. Trump has frequently attacked Smith in public, often calling him “deranged.” It’s not clear precisely what the probe is focused on, but Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas recently alleged Smith’s prosecutorial actions against Trump were geared toward influencing the 2024 election.

Other critics from his first term

Miles Taylor: Trump in April signed an executive action that, among other things, ordered the Justice Department to probe the former Department of Homeland Security official. Taylor in 2018 wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed describing a “resistance” within the administration to Trump, and later wrote a book critical of Trump.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2226748941.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-10 01:56:29.899627

Johnson",,,,,https://truthout.org/articles/texas-prison-guards-routinely-use-tear-gas-on-incarcerated-women-it-must-stop/,"In women’s prisons across Texas, tear gas — which includes agents such as pepper spray — has become the go-to response for minor infractions.
Studies have found that women experience more serious reactions to tear gas exposure, particularly impacting reproductive health.
And while research is limited, other studies have linked tear gas exposure to miscarriage and fetal harm.
Tear gas is even used in Texas juvenile facilities, as revealed in a scathing report issued by the U.S. Department of Justice that called out the misuse of tear gas on incarcerated children ages 9 and up.
She told me that she experienced tear gas exposure dozens of times before turning 20.","The first time they gassed us, I was reading in my cell. It was 2009, and I had just arrived in prison.

There was no warning, no incident — just the sudden hiss of oleoresin capsicum, better known as pepper spray, deployed because the guards said someone “refused to comply.” This refusal was defined as not returning to their assigned cell fast enough during count time, when security staff documents our presence at designated times.

Within seconds, my eyes, throat, and skin started burning. Women began screaming, coughing, and vomiting. In these dilapidated buildings without adequate ventilation, with most windows nailed shut, the gas lingers for hours. It seeps into our clothes, our bedding, our bodies.

This wasn’t an isolated incident. In women’s prisons across Texas, tear gas — which includes agents such as pepper spray — has become the go-to response for minor infractions. Guards deploy it at close range in enclosed spaces, against policy, against humanity. They gas entire housing units to punish one person’s “noncompliance.” What they don’t tell you is how this chemical weapon — which is banned in warfare by the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international treaty that aims to eliminate weapons of mass destruction — affects women’s bodies differently than men’s.

Studies have found that women experience more serious reactions to tear gas exposure, particularly impacting reproductive health. In 2021, a study on the effects of tear gas on reproductive health found that nearly 900 people reported abnormal menstrual changes after exposure to tear gas, including intense cramping and bleeding that persisted for days. And while research is limited, other studies have linked tear gas exposure to miscarriage and fetal harm. On top of reproductive health issues, medical researchers from the University of Minnesota found that repeated exposure to tear gas can also lead to chronic pain and respiratory problems.

Yet, the prison staff continues gassing us without hesitation, without immediate medical attention, without accountability.

This January, they gassed our housing dorm because M was having a mental health crisis and wouldn’t come out from under a table. (M and the other women in this essay are going by their first initials to protect their identities.) Three days later, M complained of heavy menstrual bleeding during her second cycle of the month. The medical clinic said they couldn’t definitively link it to the tear gas exposure, but we all knew the truth, having experienced similar effects before.

These physical effects of being gassed are just the beginning. In poorly ventilated prison dorms, tear gas residue clings to surfaces for days. When that happens, we’re forced to sleep on contaminated mattresses, wear contaminated clothes, and breathe contaminated air. The burning sensation returns every time we sweat, reactivating chemicals trapped in our pores. Women with asthma or other respiratory conditions suffer from choking and gasping for breath in cells that become gas chambers.

A 2020 report by Physicians for Human Rights documented the long-term effects of tear gas exposure: chronic bronchitis, asthma, reproductive health issues, and psychological trauma. But these studies were conducted on populations with access to proper medical care and compliance with decontamination procedures. In prison, we’re lucky if they let us shower after exposure. With six showers for 88 women, decontamination is impractical. More often, we’re left to decontaminate using the small sink basins in our cells, with only the hot water tap working. It spreads the chemicals around rather than removing them.

Trauma from each gassing builds up. Every hiss of a spray can trigger panic attacks. Women who’ve experienced sexual assault — and that’s most of us in here — find the loss of bodily autonomy specifically triggering. Being trapped in a small space, unable to breathe, and at the mercy of others recreates past trauma with devastating effectiveness.

Earlier this year, they gassed another dorm because someone flushed a tampon and clogged the day room toilet. S, who resides in that dorm, has severe asthma. As she struggled to breathe in her locked cell, begging for her inhaler, guards watched from behind masks. Hours later, when she finally got medical attention, they dismissed her complaints as “being dramatic.” For days, she continued coughing up mucus-streaked blood.

Criminal justice advocates have decried the growing use of tear gas and pepper spray in prisons, saying that they should only be used as a last resort when there’s a serious threat to safety. But I’ve seen guards deploy it for cursing, for walking too slowly, for asking too many questions. It’s not about safety; it’s about control, about breaking our spirits through chemical warfare.

The solution isn’t better ventilation or more careful deployment, though both would help. The solution is recognizing that the use of chemical weapons against the incarcerated — many of whom are trauma survivors — is inherently sadistic and unnecessary. Tear gas is even used in Texas juvenile facilities, as revealed in a scathing report issued by the U.S. Department of Justice that called out the misuse of tear gas on incarcerated children ages 9 and up.

D, now 22 years old, was 13 years old when she entered the juvenile facility and only 18 when she arrived at the adult prison. She told me that she experienced tear gas exposure dozens of times before turning 20. But there are other new women who arrive at the prison daily who don’t know to hold a wet cloth over their faces and aim one fan in their cell toward the door when the gas comes. They don’t understand why the air suddenly burns for no apparent reason. Maybe by the end of their first week, I’ll see less fear in their eyes because they’ve learned to recognize the hissing sound. But I still see their panic surface when they realize there’s nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

This isn’t correction or rehabilitation. It’s torture by another name.

Until there’s meaningful independent oversight and accountability, women behind bars will continue to suffer the consequences of tear gas exposure, in both the immediate and long term. Our bodies absorb these chemicals, holding and remembering them. Like so much prison trauma, we’ll carry this with us long after we’re released.

The next time you hear about tear gas being used for “riot control” or “maintaining order” in women’s prisons, remember this: There are women right now struggling to breathe, experiencing unexplained bleeding, and developing chronic conditions that will follow them for life. And for what? Because someone walked too slowly, spoke too loudly, existed too inconveniently for those with power over their bodies?

We’re not just serving time; we’re serving as test subjects for chemical weapons that no one fully understands the long-term effects. This isn’t justice. This is state-sanctioned violence against captive women, and it needs to stop.

Community members, activists and family members gathered Saturday outside Das Good Cafe in Germantown to show solidarity and rally in support of owner Anovsack “Anou” Vongbandith, who was detained by federal immigration officials last month.

Vongbandith’s wife, Ahn, told Resolve Philly that on July 28, her husband was detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is currently being held at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center.

Protesters brought signs and chanted “Who’s our neighbor? Anou’s our neighbor” and “Care not cages.” Some attended because they knew Vongbandith. Many, like Chris Hoepner, came because they wanted to fight back against deportation efforts.

“The idea that they can, you know, they arrest people that have been living here and fighting for their rights,” Hoepner said. “We have to stand up for immigrants no matter where they’re from.”

He was hopeful, however, that the rally could lead to a positive outcome.

“We’ve had amnesties that we’ve won in the past,” Hoepner said. “So I think it’s totally realizable.”

Dozens of speakers, including Vongbandith’s wife Ahn, state Sens. Chris Rabb and Art Heyward, local advocacy groups and Rev. Greg Holston, addressed the gathering.

Holston called out what he termed as the hypocrisy of the “American dream in today’s context,” saying that “if we’re really about that, then we have to stand with Anou.”

Vongbadith came to the U.S. when he was 5, fleeing Laos with his parents to escape the communist regime. He was on his way to citizenship, but ran into legal troubles when he and his wife were accused of sexual misconduct, which resulted in Vongbandith’s children being removed from their custody, as reported by Resolve Philly.

His wife previously said that Vongbadith was in custody while his kids were in foster care, so the plea deal was given as the fastest way out. Vongbadith would continue checking in with ICE every six months while he remained in the country, according to Heyward.

“Like so many others before him, Anou took a plea,” Ahn said. “When your resources are drained, when you’re exhausted, and when you want this nightmare to end, you just take what you think is the only way out.”

Ahn said that she and Vongbandith worked hard to make a good life, yelling that she couldn’t watch the person she loves being “taken away for the second time.” She spoke about the family’s efforts to bring Vongbandith home. She said her husband does not know much about Laos, can’t speak the language and has only loose connections to family in the country. She said he has an enlarged heart and is battling health issues and the family doesn’t know if he is getting the care he needs to survive.

Ahn said that Vongbandith wants to return home and rebuild his life with his loved ones.

“But when the system fails you and gives you not the right information and you’re not fully told what the choices are, the nightmare doesn’t end, it just hides until it burst open again and here we are, living the consequences over again.”

State Sen. Rabb, D-Philadelphia, said he showed up “because Anou is my neighbor.”

“America has never been great,” said Rabb, who is running for U.S. Rep Dwight Evans’ seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Evans announced earlier this year that he is retiring. “I know it’s gonna get me in trouble. This country has never been great. And it never will be great until it is good.”

Rabb’s said deportations cannot be pegged as a Republican problem.

“This has been going on for multiple administrations and not just Republican ones,” he said,

He said that if he becomes a congressman, he will continue his effort to stand against deportation, pointing to his history of trying to make Pennsylvania a “sanctuary commonwealth.”

Rev. Holston ended the rally by asking the crowd to touch one another, connecting the mass of people into one, something he emphasized made a community stronger.

Organizers said they expected around 100 people to show up on the sidewalk outside the cafe, but the crowd was at least 500 strong, spilling out into the street and causing the police to shutdown W. Chelten Avenue for the block surrounding Vongbandith’s restaurant.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/germantown_cafe_owner_ice_rally3_08092025.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 22:56:35.377657

Yang had been living in Wyoming County for three decades and was in the process of applying for a green card when he was arrested at the local immigration office.

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE via email on Saturday for comment.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump campaigned on mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, specifically targeting those with violent criminal records, and his administration ramped up immigration enforcement since his return to office in January. Recent polls, however, suggest some Americans are turning on Trump's immigration policy amid reports that individuals with no criminal records or nonviolent offenses are being targeted.

The administration said it deported around 100,000 illegal immigrants in the initial months of Trump's second term, and many individuals have been deported following the president invoking the rarely used Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been criticized and blocked by judges.

What To Know

According to ICE Buffalo, Yang was arrested ""pursuant to a warrant of removal issued by an immigration judge in 2002."" The agency stated that Yang ""has had his due process and remained at large for over 20 years."" Despite the outstanding warrant, Yang had maintained regular contact with immigration authorities through periodic check-ins and possessed a work authorization card.

Yang's daughter, Elizabeth Yang, explained to WHAM-TV that her father had recently received approval for the first step in his green card application process.

""He asked his lawyer, and his lawyer was like, 'Oh, it's OK because you should be fine,' because he just recently got approved for the first step in applying for his green card,"" she told the news station. ""So, he just went in thinking it was going to be OK.""

After stepping down from his restaurant nearly a year ago, he had been actively working toward obtaining permanent legal status. His attorney had reportedly assured the family that the routine check-in would proceed normally given his recent immigration progress.

The arrest occurred after Yang received a call on July 14 requesting his appearance at the immigration office. Elizabeth Yang described the family's shock, noting they expected a standard check-in similar to previous encounters with immigration officials.

What People Are Saying

ICE Buffalo Statement: ""ICE Buffalo arrested Chinese national You Chen Yang July 14 pursuant to a warrant of removal issued by an immigration judge in 2002. This alien has had his due process and remained at large for over 20 years.""

It continued: ""Under President Trump and DHS Secretary Noem's leadership, ICE is focused on removing illegal aliens who pose a threat to the security of our communities as well as those who have a final order of removal. Yang is in custody pending execution of his removal from the U.S.""

Yang's daughter Elizabeth Yang told WHAM-TV: ""The immigration office asks him to come in, or they'll set up an interview on the phone and just make check in with him every once in a while. So, this time, we thought it was a normal routine check-in.""

What Happens Next?

Yang remains in custody at the ICE detention center in Batavia, New York, pending execution of his removal from the United States.

His family has maintained phone contact, and some have visited him at the facility. They are currently working with an attorney to address the legal situation and explore potential resolution options.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699758/ice-agents.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 22:56:39.473795

Sectors like immigration services and legal tech may offer short-term gains but require careful risk management.
Consider: - Diversification: Balance exposure to enforcement-focused contractors (e.g., GEO Group) with investments in sectors less tied to immigration policy, such as renewable energy or consumer staples.","The recent legal battles over the Trump administration's deportation policies have crystallized a broader institutional conflict between the executive and judicial branches, with profound implications for policy predictability and investor confidence. From 2023 to 2025, the administration's aggressive use of the Alien Enemies Act to justify mass deportations—coupled with its defiance of court orders—has created a volatile legal landscape. This tension is not merely a political spectacle; it signals a systemic erosion of checks and balances, which investors must now weigh against the backdrop of economic uncertainty.

Legal Overreach and Judicial Pushback

The administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act in early 2025 to deport over 250 Venezuelan men sparked immediate legal challenges. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg initially halted the deportations, citing “willful disregard” of judicial authority. However, the Trump administration ignored the ruling, proceeding with deportations to El Salvador. A split decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals in late 2025 further muddied the waters: Trump-appointed judges ruled that the judiciary overstepped its authority in foreign affairs, while dissenting judge Cornelia Pillard argued the lower court's actions were a necessary check on executive overreach.

This legal tug-of-war highlights a dangerous precedent: when the executive branch treats courts as an obstacle rather than a collaborator, it undermines the predictability of policy enforcement. For investors, this unpredictability translates into heightened risk. Sectors reliant on stable regulatory environments—such as immigration services, legal tech, and government contracts—face a landscape where rules can shift overnight, often without due process.

Economic Implications: Labor, Growth, and Market Volatility

The administration's immigration policies have directly impacted labor markets and investor sentiment. By prioritizing mass deportations and restricting legal immigration, the U.S. risks labor shortages in agriculture, construction, and healthcare—industries that depend on immigrant labor. According to Allianz Trade, these policies could push GDP growth below 2% by 2026, while the Brookings Institution estimates a 0.4 percentage point drag on 2025 growth.

Private prison contractors like GEO Group and CoreCivic have benefited from the administration's $45 billion investment in expanding detention facilities. However, their fortunes are tied to a policy agenda that faces ongoing legal and ethical scrutiny. Meanwhile, legal tech firms—tasked with managing rapidly changing immigration rules—have seen surges in demand for compliance tools but operate in a market rife with uncertainty.

The VIX (volatility index) has also reflected this instability. As of July 2025, the VIX spiked to 22.5, a level not seen since the early days of the pandemic, driven in part by fears of inflation from labor shortages and retaliatory trade policies.

Sector-Specific Risks and Opportunities

Immigration Services: Nonprofits and legal aid organizations face funding cuts and operational challenges as the administration prioritizes enforcement over humanitarian programs. For example, the shuttering of the CBP One appointment system left asylum-seekers in legal limbo, destabilizing resettlement agencies.

Legal Tech: Firms developing identity verification systems or compliance tools for immigration enforcement have seen increased demand, but their success hinges on the longevity of policies like H.R. 1, which allocates $170.1 billion for ICE.

Government Contracts: While enforcement agencies like ICE and CBP have expanded, contracts are often subject to litigation or abrupt policy reversals. For instance, the administration's forced sharing of IRS data with ICE raised privacy concerns, complicating partnerships with tech firms.

Investment Advice: Navigating the Storm

For investors, the key takeaway is to hedge against policy-driven volatility. Sectors like immigration services and legal tech may offer short-term gains but require careful risk management. Consider:

- Diversification: Balance exposure to enforcement-focused contractors (e.g., GEO Group) with investments in sectors less tied to immigration policy, such as renewable energy or consumer staples.

- ESG Considerations: Avoid firms complicit in policies facing widespread public and judicial backlash. The administration's targeting of legal aid providers and its retaliation against judges like Boasberg have drawn sharp criticism from civil rights groups.

- Monitoring Indicators: Track the VIX and sector-specific indices (e.g., the S&P 500's utilities or healthcare sectors) to gauge market sentiment shifts tied to immigration-related volatility.

Conclusion: A New Normal of Institutional Conflict

The Trump administration's deportation policies are not an isolated episode but a harbinger of a broader trend: the politicization of legal institutions and the erosion of policy predictability. As courts and Congress grapple with executive overreach, investors must adapt to a world where legal rulings can reshape markets overnight. The lesson is clear: in an era of institutional conflict, resilience lies in agility and a deep understanding of the interplay between law, politics, and economics.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-10 04:56:36.710262

Both courts arrived at the same conclusion: the statute does not require an asylee to remain the spouse of the principal asylee until USCIS adjudicates the application.
USCIS has stated in each of its denial decisions that it did so because Ms. Zalmai was not lawfully admitted to permanent residence because she had divorced her husband prior to the adjudication of her adjustment application.
If the only reason Ms. Zalmai’s application was denied was because USCIS did not adjudicate her application soon enough, that is an arbitrary and capricious result.
Defendant is directed to approve Mursal Zalmai’s application for naturalization.","Where the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asserted an applicant for lawful permanent residence who derives their asylee status from being a spouse of a refugee must continue to be a spouse of a refugee until their application for adjustment has been adjudicated, it erred.

Background

Mursal Zalmai has filed this civil action against the Director of USCIS. The central question in dispute is whether under 8 U.S.C. § 1159(b)(3), an applicant for lawful permanent residence who derives their asylee status from being a spouse of a refugee must “continue[]” to be a spouse of a refugee: (1) until their application for adjustment has been adjudicated or (2) only at the time they file their application for adjustment.

Because plaintiff divorced her husband prior to the adjudication of her adjustment application, USCIS asserts that she was not eligible for lawful permanent residence. Consequently, USCIS asserts that plaintiff was ineligible to be naturalized. The parties have cross-filed motions for summary judgment.

Analysis

Both agree that an applicant must, at some point, continue to be a spouse of the asylee. Instead, the dispute turns on how long the applicant must continue to be a spouse or child of such a refugee: (1) at the time of filing the adjustment application or (2) through adjudication of the application. A natural and plain reading of the text of subsection (b)(3) does not expressly foreclose either possibility. Thus, the meaning of the text alone is ambiguous. Even looking to the surrounding provisions of the statute, the meaning of subsection (b)(3) remains unclear.

Under Chevron U.S.A. Inc., v. Nat. Res. Def Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), this court would next normally determine whether the agency’s interpretation of the statute is reasonable or permissible. However, USCIS’s regulation directly interpreting this specific statute merely restates the statute, with slight deviations in the language. Notably, defendant does not argue that this court should afford 8 C.F.R. § 209.2(a)(iiii) any interpretive weight. The court will first determine the best reading of the statutory text, independent of the agency regulation.

Soumah v. Collett, 738 F. Supp. 3d 631 (D. Md. 2024), and Dorbor v. United States, 379 F. Supp. 3d. 765 (W.D. Wis. 2019), are the only cases which address the proper interpretation of § 1159(b)(3). Both courts arrived at the same conclusion: the statute does not require an asylee to remain the spouse of the principal asylee until USCIS adjudicates the application. The court agrees.

To find that a spouse need only “continue” to be a spouse of a refugee for at least one year after being granted asylum honors that an applicant was lawfully an asylee and timely applied to be lawfully permanent resident. This construction renders the denial of their naturalization applications less arbitrary.

USCIS has stated in each of its denial decisions that it did so because Ms. Zalmai was not lawfully admitted to permanent residence because she had divorced her husband prior to the adjudication of her adjustment application. If the only reason Ms. Zalmai’s application was denied was because USCIS did not adjudicate her application soon enough, that is an arbitrary and capricious result. This court agrees with plaintiff, and the Soumah and Dorbor courts, that the best reading of this statute is that an applicant need only continue to be the spouse of an asylee until the applicant applies for adjustment of status at least one year after the asylee has been granted asylum.

Although the court need not address the impact of USCIS’s regulations on its interpretation of subsection (b)(3), the agency regulations here do not change the court’s conclusion. Defendant notes that § 103.2(b)(1) requires that an applicant must establish eligibility “for the requested benefit at the time of filing the benefit request and must continue to be eligible through adjudication.”

Plaintiff counters that § 103.2(b)(1)’s requirement that eligibility be established through adjudication is not part of the statutory criteria, nor does it determine what the statute requires. This court agrees with plaintiff that compliance with agency regulations is not part of the statutory criteria for eligibility of adjustment of status. A failure to properly complete an application form as required by the agency is distinct from the question at issue here – whether plaintiff met the statutory criteria for adjustment eligibility. Defendant is directed to approve Mursal Zalmai’s application for naturalization.

Plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment granted. Defendant’s motion for summary judgment denied.

An anonymous Department of Homeland Security official reported witnessing pregnant women sleeping on the floor in intake cells.

In addition to the treatment of pregnant women, the report also details 18 cases of mistreatment of children and 41 cases of physical or sexual abuse.","A new Senate report has identified 510 credible allegations of human rights abuses in U.S. immigration detention centers across the country, including 14 specific cases involving the mistreatment of pregnant women.

The investigation, led by Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia, cites inadequate medical care, delayed treatment, poor nutrition, and unsanitary living conditions among the most serious concerns.

The report, titled ""The Abuse of Pregnant Women & Children in U.S. Immigration Detention"" documents cases of pregnant women being denied urgent care, sleeping on floors in overcrowded cells, and not receiving adequate meals or snacks.

In one case, a woman was reportedly left to miscarry alone in a hospital room for over 24 hours without water or medical assistance after staff at the detention facility delayed responding to days of heavy bleeding. According to the report, her partner contacted the senator's office after two days of no communication. The woman later described the detention conditions as ""horrific,"" citing overcrowding, limited access to medical care, and abusive treatment by guards.

An anonymous Department of Homeland Security official reported witnessing pregnant women sleeping on the floor in intake cells. Another pregnant detainee told Representative Ayanna Pressley that she ""nearly miscarried twice"" while in custody. Emergency call records from multiple detention centers further corroborate reports of serious pregnancy complications.

When asked for comment, DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News that ""any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false,"" and asserted that all detainees receive medical, dental, and mental health screenings as well as 24-hour emergency care.

In addition to the treatment of pregnant women, the report also details 18 cases of mistreatment of children and 41 cases of physical or sexual abuse. The investigation included interviews with correctional officers, healthcare workers, attorneys, and 46 detainees and family members, as well as reviews of public documents and inspections at facilities in Texas and Georgia.

Senator Ossoff told NBC News that ""regardless of our views on immigration policy, the American people do not support the abuse of detainees and prisoners,"" adding that ""it's more important than ever to shine a light on what's happening behind bars and barbed wire, especially and most shockingly to children.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/582553/california-city-immigration-processing-center-kern-county.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 19:56:57.907480

Outside, where it was hot and steamy by mid-morning, several sun-blasted day laborers said they appreciated the support.","“Thank you so much for showing up this morning,” Sharon Nicholls said into a megaphone at 8 a.m. Wednesday outside a Home Depot in Pasadena.

As of Friday afternoon, no federal agents had raided the store on East Walnut Street. But the citizen brigade that stands watch outside and patrols the parking lot in search of ICE agents has not let down its guard—especially not after raids at three other Home Depots in recent days despite federal court rulings limiting sweeps. On Friday, a Home Depot in Van Nuys was raided twice before noon.

About two dozen people gathered Wednesday near the tent that serves as headquarters of the East Pasadena Community Defense Center. Another dozen or so would be arriving over the next half hour, some carrying signs.

“Silence is Violence”

“Migrants Don’t Party With Epstein”

Cynthia Lunine, 70, carried a large sign that read “Break His Dark Spell” and included a sinister image of President Trump. She said she was new to political activism, but added: “You can’t not be an activist. If you’re an American, it’s the only option. The immigration issue is absolutely inhumane, it’s un-Christian, and it’s intolerable.”

There are local supporters, for sure, of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Activists told me there aren’t many days in which they don’t field shouted profanities or pro-Trump cheers from Home Depot shoppers.

But the administration’s blather about a focus on violent offenders led to huge demonstrations in greater Los Angeles beginning in June, and the cause continues to draw people into the streets. Not all day laborers are undocumented, one Pasadena protester told me, and the taxpayer-funded use of federal forces to arrest people looking for work is offensive.

Dayena Campbell, 35, is a volunteer at Community Defense Corner operations in other parts of Pasadena, a movement that followed high-profile raids and was covered in the Colorado Boulevard newspaper and, later, in the New York Times. A fulltime student who works in sales, Campbell was also cruising the parking lot at the Home Depot on the east side of Pasadena in search of federal agents.

She thought this Home Depot needed its own Community Defense Corner, so she started one about a month ago. She and her cohort have more than once spotted agents in the area and alerted day laborers. About half have scattered, she said, and half have held firm despite the risk.

When I asked what motivated Campbell, she said:

“Inhumane, illegal kidnappings. Lack of due process. Actions taken without anyone being held accountable. Seeing people’s lives ripped apart. Seeing families being destroyed in the blink of an eye.”

Anywhere from a handful to a dozen volunteers show up daily to to hand out literature, patrol the parking lot and check in on day laborers, sometimes bringing them food. Once a week, Nicholls helps organize a rally that includes a march through the parking lot and into the store, where the protesters present a letter asking Home Depot management to “say no to ICE in their parking lot and in their store.”

Nicholls is an LAUSD teacher-librarian, and when she asks for support each week, working and retired teachers answer the call.

“I’m yelling my lungs out,” said retired teacher Mary Rose O’Leary, who joined in the chants of “ICE out of Home Depot” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here.”

“Immigrants are what make this city what it is … and the path to legal immigration is closed to everybody who doesn’t have what, $5 million or something?” O’Leary said, adding that she was motivated by “the Christian ideal of welcoming the stranger.”

Retired teacher Dan Murphy speaks Spanish and regularly checks in with day laborers.

“One guy said to me, ‘We’re just here to work.’ Some of the guys were like, ‘We’re not criminals … we’re just here … to make money and get by,’” Murphy said. He called the raids a flexing of “the violent arm of what autocracy can bring,” and he resents Trump’s focus on Southern California.

“I take it personally. I’m white, but these are my people. California is my people. And it bothers me what might happen in this country if people don’t stand firm … I just said, ‘I gotta do something.’ I’m doing this now so I don’t hate myself later.”

Nicholls told me she was an activist many years ago, and then turned her focus to work and raising a family. But the combination of wildfires, the cleanup and rebuilding, and the raids, brought her out of activism retirement.

“The first people to come out after the firefighters—the second-responders—were day laborers cleaning the streets,” Nicholls said. “You’d see them in orange shirts all over the city, cleaning up.”

The East Pasadena Home Depot is “an important store,” because it’s a supply center for the rebuilding of Altadena, “and we’re going out there to show our love and solidarity for our neighbors,” Nicholls said. To strike the fear of deportation in the hearts of workers, she said, is “inhumane, and to me, it’s morally wrong.”

Nicholls had a quick response when I asked what she thinks of those who say illegal is illegal, so what’s left to discuss?

“That blocks the complexity of the conversation,” she said, and doesn’t take into account the hunger and violence that drive migration. Her husband, she said, left El Salvador 35 years ago during a war funded in part by the U.S.

They have family members with legal status and some who are undocumented and afraid to leave their homes, Nicholls said. I mentioned that I had written about Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo, who was undocumented as a child, and has kept his passport handy since the raids began. In that column, I quoted Gordo’s friend, immigrant-rights leader Pablo Alvarado, director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.

“Full disclosure,” Nicholls said, “[Alvarado] is my husband.”

It was news to me.

When the raids began, Nicholls said, she told her husband, “I have the summer off, sweetie, but I want to help, and I’m going to call my friends.”

On Wednesday, after Nicholls welcomed demonstrators, Alvarado showed up for a pep talk.

“I have lived in this country since 1990 ... and I love it as much as I love the small village where I came from in El Salvador,” Alvarado said. “Some people may say that we are going into fascism, into authoritarianism, and I would say that we are already there.”

He offered details of a raid that morning at a Home Depot in Westlake and said the question is not whether the Pasadena store will be raided, but when. This country readily accepts the labor of immigrants but it does not respect their humanity, Alvarado said.

“When humble people are attacked,” he said, “we are here to bear witness.”

Nicholls led demonstrators through the parking lot and into the store, where she read aloud the letter asking Home Depot to take a stand against raids.

Outside, where it was hot and steamy by mid-morning, several sun-blasted day laborers said they appreciated the support. But they were still fearful, and desperate for work.

Jorge, just shy of 70, practically begged me to take his phone number.

Whatever work I might have, he said, please call.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8783848/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2F38%2F8c5e5d044117b6cb0aa553ee65e0%2F1517049-me-0806-lopez-anti-ice-rally-home-depot-gem-002.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 18:56:39.856526

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — A legal organization challenging President Donald Trump's administration on multiple fronts filed a new lawsuit on Friday seeking the release of records detailing the handling of the sex trafficking investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.

The group Democracy Forward sued the Justice Department and the FBI for senior administration officials’ communication about Epstein documents and any regarding correspondence between him and Trump.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, appears to the be first of its kind. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled.

“The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,” said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal government often shields records related to criminal investigations from public view.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Democracy Forward has filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump's Republican administration, challenging policies and executive orders in areas including education, immigration and health care.

The Epstein case has been subject to heightened public focus since the Justice Department said last month it would not release additional documents from the case, despite assurance from Attorney General Pam Bondi.

The decision sparked frustration and anger among online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump’s base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up.

The Trump administration has sought to unseal grand jury transcripts, though that has been denied by a judge in Florida. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public.

A similar request for the work of a different grand jury is pending in New York.

The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files on the investigation, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials.

Since Epstein’s 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on the wealthy financier and who else knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls.

Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and says he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department’s decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation. But lawmakers from both major political parties have refused to let it go.

A cell phone video from July 31 in Ambridge, a borough Deluzio represents, captured a masked federal immigration officer detaining a man as bystanders ask questions and voice their views. Deluzio said he and his office have posed basic questions to ICE for weeks regarding this and other operations in the Pittsburgh region, and they have not yet received answers.

""Traditionally, when a member of Congress asks a federal law enforcement agency for basic information, we expect an answer, and that's what should be happening here,"" Deluzio said on Friday.

On Tuesday, he escalated his inquiries with a letter to ICE acting director Todd Lyons. Deluzio opened it, saying, ""Your agency's Office of Congressional Relations provided a pathetic, inadequate, and unacceptable response to my office's inquiries about recent ICE activity in Ambridge. ... This will not fly with me.""

He said ICE responded by saying, ""We're not tracking any information specific [to] non-routine operations in Robinson Township, PA; Carnegie, PA; or Ambridge, PA…""

In continued correspondence, Deluzio went on to list nine questions on topics like the number of people detained and their status.

""You see Beaver County District Attorney Nate Bible issue press releases and give public information about what his office is doing. You see information from our local departments. What I see out of ICE right now is not transparency, and why my letter was so blunt and direct,"" Deluzio told KDKA.

Bible told KDKA that the Ambridge Police Department, with assistance from county agencies, conducted a ""saturation operation"" on July 31 that ""was in no way an 'ICE RAID'"" but ICE agents were present. He said out of 70 traffic stops, 20 were undocumented immigrants, and out of those 20, ICE detained 12 who had criminal records or outstanding warrants or pending criminal charges. Eight undocumented immigrants were let go. Bible said he is aware of at least one bystander cited for disorderly conduct.

While Bible told KDKA that he hasn't tried to speak to ICE and received this information from police, Deluzio said in his congressional oversight role, he should have received these kinds of details and more from the agency. Deluzio said he will push for accountability.

""The committees in the House and the Senate have the power to call witnesses to issue subpoenas. I need the Republican majority, frankly, to work with Democrats to do that,"" Deluzio said.

We call for her immediate release and a full dismissal of all the charges brought against her.

All over the country, people have been standing up to the Trump administration’s immoral and unjust immigration raids, which have sowed intense fear and chaos in immigrant and migrant communities. In the absence of due process that protects Constitutional rights, people like Amanda Trebach – a RN and former member of California Nurses Association, an affiliate of National Nurses United – have taken up the essential role of monitoring ICE and Border Patrol, to protect the rights of community members and observe and document abductions by masked officers. While Amanda was participating in a community patrol Thursday morning, she was confronted by masked individuals believed to be ICE agents, pushed to the floor face-down, and violently detained. Her arrest is a direct and intentional attack against the constitutional right to protest.

“As nurses, we advocate for our patients both at the bedside and beyond. Like all the violent escalations we have seen this year – including, but not limited, to using hospitals as a site for ICE law enforcement and arresting labor leaders and elected officials for demanding due process – they are meant to silence concerned Americans into accepting these authoritarian tactics,” said Sandy Reding, RN, who is a president of California Nurses Association and a vice president of National Nurses United, which is the nation’s largest union of registered nurses. “We refuse to stand by and watch as our patients and our community members are caught in the dragnet of the Trump administration’s cruel deportation schemes. Amanda must come home, and so must all the innocent people whose lives and whose families’ lives have been devastated by this administration.”

The group Democracy Forward sued the Justice Department and the FBI for senior administration officials' communication about Epstein documents and any regarding correspondence between him and Trump.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, appears to the be first of its kind. The group says it submitted requests under the Freedom of Information Act for the records related to communications about the case in late July that have not yet been fulfilled.

""The court should intervene urgently to ensure the public has access to the information they need about this extraordinary situation,"" said Skye Perryman, the president and CEO of the Democratic-aligned group, in a statement. The federal government often shields records related to criminal investigations from public view.

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Democracy Forward has filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump's Republican administration, challenging policies and executive orders in areas including education, immigration and health care.

The Epstein case has been subject to heightened public focus since the Justice Department said last month it would not release additional documents from the case, despite assurance from Attorney General Pam Bondi.

The decision sparked frustration and anger among online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and elements of Trump's base who had hoped to see proof of a government cover-up.

The Trump administration has sought to unseal grand jury transcripts, though that has been denied by a judge in Florida. U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in West Palm Beach said the request to release grand jury documents from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the extraordinary exceptions under federal law that could make them public.

A similar request for the work of a different grand jury is pending in New York.

The House Oversight Committee has also subpoenaed the Justice Department for files on the investigation, part of a congressional probe that lawmakers believe may show links to Trump and other former top officials.

Since Epstein's 2019 death in a New York jail cell as he awaited trial for sex trafficking charges, conservative conspiracists have stoked theories about what information investigators gathered on the wealthy financier and who else knew about his sexual abuse of teenage girls.

Trump has denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and says he cut off their relationship long ago, and he has repeatedly tried to move past the Justice Department's decision not to release a full accounting of the investigation. But lawmakers from both major political parties have refused to let it go.

“They’ve got a rap sheet, 12, 14 different cases long of child predators that they’re taking off the street,” Dr. Phil said.

“Why are you going on these ICE raids?” Maher asked Dr. Phil. “I don’t understand that.”

Maher continued: “You’re a guy who we know for so many years who has been working to put families together. To bring families who are apart and heal them. And now you’re going on raids with people who are literally separating families.”

The former clinical psychologist pulled no figurative punches.

“Well, now that’s bullsh—t,” Dr. Phil countered, before launching into a comparison.

“Look, if you arrest somebody that’s a citizen, that has committed a crime or is DUI’d with a child in the backseat, do you think they don’t separate that family right then, right there?” Dr. Phil asked. “Of course they do!”

“But that’s not what’s going on,” Maher argued.

Moments earlier, Maher had introduced the topic as “another thing” President Donald Trump is doing as he is “doubling down on unpopular.”

Dr. Phil took an even further step back, addressing part of Maher’s monologue where he had criticized masked ICE agents. He said the masks are a result of legislators “doxxing” officers.

“[Legislators are] putting their names, their pictures, their addresses of their families on the internet, they’re putting them on telephone poles,” Dr. Phil noted. “So, of course, they’re wearing masks so they don’t get outed, so people can do violence against their families.”

The former talk show host cited “files” he had seen to justify the ICE operations he has joined.

“They’ve got a rap sheet, 12, 14 different cases long of child predators that they’re taking off the street,” Dr. Phil said.

“These are the worst first that they’re taking off the streets. Who would want them back in their communities?”

ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith, who was also a guest on Maher’s show Friday, found some common ground with Dr. Phil and admitted that he supports “closing the borders,” but argued the administration’s actions have not matched their words.

“When you’re going to Home Depot, when you’re going to people’s jobs, when you’ve been given authorization to enter churches and to enter other properties…who they have been targeting has been different than what they originally advertised,” Smith concluded.

Maher echoed Smith’s argument, adding ICE is going to places where people are “already working.”

“If you can’t go to work because you’re hiding, what other recourse is it for [illegal immigrants] except crime?” Maher asked.Dr. Phil has reportedly accompanied ICE two times – first on the ground during January’s Chicago raids and during the Los Angeles raids in June.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/newspress-collage-cgjm0ggue-1754728478827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754714110&w=1024,N,,2025-08-09 15:56:34.905105

The administration asked U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles during a hearing to dissolve the policy, which limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires them to be kept in safe and sanitary conditions. Gee did not immediately issue a decision and it’s not clear how soon she might rule.

Gee, who oversees what is known as the Flores agreement, expressed skepticism at the government’s request. She said that while border apprehensions have dropped under President Donald Trump, conditions “are deteriorating.”

“It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama.

Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep the protections and oversight in place and submitted firsthand accounts from immigrants in family detention who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam.

In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

In court, an attorney for the government acknowledged that the agreement gets in the way of Trump’s tax and spending bill that provided billions to build new immigration facilities, including family detention centers.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of migrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s. It governs the conditions for all immigrant children in U.S. custody, including those traveling alone or with their parents.

It also limits how long CBP can detain child immigrants to 72 hours. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services then takes custody of the children.

The Biden administration successfully pushed to partially end the agreement last year. Gee ruled that special court supervision may end when HHS takes custody, but she carved out exceptions for certain types of facilities for children with more acute needs.

Advocates for the children say the government is holding children beyond the time limits set out in the agreement. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours and that 14 children, including toddlers, were held for over 20 days in April. As part of their court filings, they included testimony from several families who were held in family detention centers in Texas.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.marshallindependent.com/images/2016/11/28153330/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 00:57:15.743960

With estimates on the undocumented population varying widely, from around 11 million to as high as 20 million, just how big is the U.S. population, and just how much impact are undocumented migrants having on the wider, legal population?

""Congressional representation is a zero-sum proposition. When one state gains a seat in Congress due to the presences of illegal aliens, American citizens in another state necessarily lose representation,"" Ira Mehlman, media director at the anti-immigration Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Newsweek when asked about Trump's plan.

""By some estimates, California's large illegal alien population resulted in that state getting four to five more representatives than it would have if illegal aliens were excluded for this purpose. The system actually rewards states that enact policies that draw illegal aliens.""

How Big Is The US Population?

Over the last two years, estimates for the overall U.S. population have hovered above 331 million, based off the 2020 census, with the latest estimate from the U.S. Census Bureau in its American Community Survey putting the number at 334,914,896.

That figure was broken down by native-born population (85.7 percent) and foreign-born population (14.3 percent), with nearly two-thirds of the latter having entered the U.S. before 2010.

Out of the 47.8 million foreign-born U.S. residents, 24.9 million were naturalized U.S. citizens, while the rest were not, but their legal status was not provided.

With immigration at the heart of the national political conversation in recent years – following unprecedented crossing numbers at the U.S.-Mexico border, programs to allow for legal migration from the Biden administration, and calls for mass deportations – much has been written about what the data on population numbers really means.

In March, the non-partisan Migration Policy Institute (MPI) stated that immigration had accounted for the entirety of the U.S.' population growth in a single year for the first time, amid falling American-born birthrates.

More recently, the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies found that the foreign-born population grew by more than 300 percent over the past 46 years in 26 states.

Trump, and the MAGA movement, are focused on illegal immigrants and the concern that including them in census data has a negative impact on natural-born and naturalized citizens, particularly when it comes to representation.

Undocumented Immigrants' Impact on Congress

""These numbers matter enormously for apportionment—states like California, Texas, and Florida have substantial undocumented populations that currently contribute to their congressional representation,"" Gil Guerra, immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, told Newsweek.

The difference between the legal and illegal immigrant population is important. The Trump administration is specifically looking to avoid counting the undocumented population by the time the next census is scheduled to take place in 2030, leaving those with legal status still counted among the U.S. population.

The U.S. Constitution requires a census every decade that counts the ""whole number of persons in each state."" This language has long been interpreted by the courts to include all residents, regardless of citizenship or immigration status.

Currently, the wide range of estimates – including from Trump himself during the 2024 election campaign – make it difficult to fully know the impact of undocumented immigrants on population counts.

If the figure is around 11 million — as estimated by the Biden administration in 2022 — then the share of the total U.S. population would be between 3 and 4 percent, per Pew Research Center and MPI. Conservative and anti-immigration groups put the estimate at far higher.

FAIR put the figure of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. at around 18 million. Under that number, the undocumented share of the U.S. population would be about 5 percent.

""The inclusion of illegal aliens in the Census not only impacts apportionment of representation, but potentially the outcome of national elections,"" Mehlman said, arguing for a census count that strips out undocumented residents.

""Each state's electoral vote count is based on the number of seats it holds in the House. Thus, the current system of counting illegal aliens for congressional apportionment could determine the outcome of a close presidential election.""

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Newsweek that making such a change to the population count would likely have little effect on the distribution of seats in Congress, ""with very little partisan effect on net.""

""The plan is blatantly unconstitutional,"" Bier said. ""There is not even the slightest ambiguity here. He is effectively setting aside the Constitution based on a partisan conspiracy theory.""

The Census Bureau has already said it is making plans for its next count in 2030, stating on its website that it is working on an ""initial, high-level design"", but making the kind of change the president wants to see would require a constitutional amendment.

""It seems to me that the plan will likely get mired in legal challenges,"" Guerra of the Niskanen Center, told Newsweek, pointing to a similar attempt Trump made toward the end of his first term in 2020.

""The most likely outcome is protracted litigation that could drag past the 2026 midterms, making the exercise moot for redistricting purposes. Moreover, this could backfire if the resulting undercount affects red states with growing immigrant populations like Texas and Florida.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2699447/nyc-street-scene.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 17:57:41.201533

by Erica Bryant, Associate Director of Writing, Vera Institute of Justice

On July 8, the Trump administration announced a new policy that prevents judges from granting bond to anyone held in detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who had entered the United States without documentation. This policy—in tandem with the Laken Riley Act’s expansion of mandatory detention and the One Big Beautiful Bill’s supercharged spending on immigration enforcement and new immigration prisons—threatens to send thousands more people into notoriously appalling conditions as they await their day in court.

What Trump’s policy does

Under existing law, immigration judges have the discretion to determine whether a person held in detention is neither a flight risk nor a danger to their community and is qualified for a bond hearing. At the hearing, the person could then argue that they should be released on bond as their case continues. However, judges are denied this discretion if the person falls under several categories, including how they entered the United States and whether they have been convicted of certain crimes. In these cases, the person is put under “mandatory detention” and forced to fight their case while incarcerated.

The Laken Riley Act, enacted in January, vastly expanded the criteria for mandatory detention to include people arrested for and accused of many nonviolent theft-related offenses and, for the first time, those arrested for and accused of criminal conduct but who have yet to be given a fair trial to determine their innocence. In July, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would further expand mandatory detention to anyone who entered the country without inspection.

This means that millions of people who might have been granted a bond hearing are now being denied one and kept in ICE detention. Meanwhile, as releases from immigration prisons have slowed to a trickle, daily detention numbers have reached record highs. By stripping even more people of the possibility of supervised release, Trump’s new actions will make things exponentially worse.

Immigration detention is unnecessary

Locking people away in immigration prison when they are suspected of being in the country without legal status is unjust and unnecessary. Decades of research shows that people do not need to be held behind bars to ensure that they appear for their immigration court proceedings.

We have also long seen how holding people in jail before trial in the criminal court system has made communities less safe. In criminal cases, pretrial release is typically conditioned on whether someone can pay a bail amount set by a judge at arraignment. This system ties a person’s freedom to their ability to pay for it. If a person is jailed before trial, it increases the likelihood they will lose work, fall behind on their bills, and lose custody of their children, compounding poverty and, with it, the drivers of crime.

Even for people with resources, the chaotic and dysfunctional immigration system already makes it difficult to get a hearing and be granted an affordable bond. Bond was only granted in 31 percent of cases heard during the first nine months of 2023, and the median bond amount that year was $7,000—an impossible sum for many.

And notably, many immigrants who will now face imprisonment without a chance to seek bond likely do have a path to legal residency in the United States. Under both U.S. and international law, for example, people who face danger in their home country have the right to go to other nations to seek safety and have their requests for asylum considered. Other people—such as survivors of trafficking, violent crime, and child abuse—may have the option to pursue residency through additional legal avenues.

The immigration system is already unfair and inhumane

The current immigration court backlog already exceeds 3.5 million cases; proceedings can take months, years, or even a decade to resolve. And now, the Trump administration is pouring even more money into locking more people up while simultaneously reducing the capacity of immigration courts and the legal service providers who defend immigrants’ due process rights. More than 50 judges have been fired, and dozens of others have taken advantage of incentives to resign voluntarily. Funding for legal service providers has also been gutted, even though people in detention already lack legal representation in nearly 50 percent of cases.

In 2023, more than 90 percent of the then-30,000 people in ICE’s deadly facilities on any given day were held in immigration prisons run by private corporations. These companies, which include GEO Group, CoreCivic, and LaSalle Corrections, have long lists of documented human rights abuses like forced labor, inhumane living conditions, sexual abuse, forced sterilizations, and medical neglect. And they’re now ramping up capacity as the number of people in detention balloons. State-operated facilities seem to offer no better treatment; people detained in the new, hastily constructed Florida Everglades facility (so-called Alligator Alcatraz) are being caged in chain-link enclosures and have reported health hazards, including floods of waste water, insects, and inedible food.

Trump’s aggressive enforcement since January has put more people in detention and will lengthen the time they’re forced to spend waiting for the resolution of their cases. Faced with the cruelty of immigration prison, many who have lawful claims to stay safely in the United States will have all the more incentive to instead accept deportation.

No one is made safer by keeping people in immigration prison

It is inhumane to make people fleeing danger await the outcome of their court proceedings while locked away in deadly immigration facilities. People who come to the United States deserve dignity, safety, and fairness of due process. They should be free to attend immigration court with the support of legal representation to help them understand their rights and prevent wrongful deportations.

This is a human rights crisis. Funneling thousands more people into an immigration detention system that is riddled with abuse and cruelty will cause immeasurable harm. The impact extends beyond the lives of immigrants themselves—it is separating families, destabilizing communities, and jeopardizing our economy. While Trump states that his mass detention and deportation agenda promotes public safety, the opposite is true. Sending masked agents into workplaces, courthouses, places of worship, schools, and homes to terrorize everyday people who pose no real threat to public safety is causing rippling harm and distrust. Instead of spending billions of dollars to expand pretrial detention, we should be devoting resources to programs that promote family unity, build strong communities and economies, and actually keep people safe.

In July, Yang and more than a dozen others in the Metro Detroit Hmong and Laotian communities received letters for what they thought was a routine immigration check-in on July 30th. It wasn’t.

""Without him, she won’t be able to get by—her life will be at risk, her home will be at risk,"" said daughter Anissa Lee through tears.

What they're saying:

Xiong is working to free these refugees, whose detention hits very close to home.

""I’m a surviving Hmong refugee and the only Hmong American elected in the state of Michigan,"" said Xiong. ""These individuals came here lawfully—as refugees—just like me.""

She says the detainees were taken to Texas and now Louisiana, where they are sleeping on concrete floors, and there isn’t enough food.

""This past week has been a nightmare,"" she said. ""These family members are desperate—we don’t have a lot of time.""

Meanwhile, a coalition of state lawmakers, immigration attorneys, and advocates is working to secure their release, but those detained already had final deportation orders—some from decades ago that are only now being acted upon.

The funding, drawn from the State Department’s economic support fund—typically reserved for development programs in allied nations—will be transferred to the Department of Homeland Security. DHS will coordinate with Costa Rican authorities to conduct deportations, though a timeline has not been disclosed.

“The Department intends to support the Government of Costa Rica in conducting deportation operations of migrants that do not have international protections or other legal grounds to remain,” the document reads. The plan includes providing air transportation, technical advice, and logistical support for the deportation process.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by:

The initiative appears to be modeled “in part” on a 2024 agreement between the Biden administration and Panama, in which the U.S. financed efforts by Panama to detain and deport migrants transiting north from Colombia. That agreement sparked criticism from Democratic lawmakers and migrant advocacy groups, who warned it could deny asylum access to vulnerable populations.

In this case, the State Department says the funding will primarily assist Costa Rica in removing migrants who are passing through the country en route to the U.S., rather than individuals deported directly from American soil.

“The program will build capacity of the Costa Rican immigration authorities to stop the flow of illegal migration through its borders, while also providing training and resources on asylum screening,” a State Department spokesperson said.

It remains unclear which countries Costa Rica would send deportees to under the new plan, raising the possibility that some could be relocated to third countries. Human rights groups have previously raised concerns about similar arrangements, especially when deportees have no clear legal or familial ties to the countries receiving them.

The Trump administration has increasingly leaned on foreign partnerships to facilitate deportations, including with governments in Panama, El Salvador, and Chile. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has traveled to several of these countries in recent months to negotiate immigration cooperation.

Stotzky, AL DIAZ",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/article311639690.html,"Ron DeSantis has carved something unthinkable: an unregulated and patently unconstitutional detention center for immigrants.
Though described by Florida’s attorney general as a “low-cost, temporary detention facility,” the truth is far more sinister.
This is not a detention facility.
Even ICE — not known for its compassion — has distanced itself from this disaster, confirming that this is not a federal facility.
If that is true, then ICE has no legal oversight, and detention is occurring outside any authorized federal immigration process.","In the heart of the Everglades — sacred ground for Native American tribes and ecological treasures — Gov. Ron DeSantis has carved something unthinkable: an unregulated and patently unconstitutional detention center for immigrants.

Republicans have mockingly dubbed it Alligator Alcatraz, evoking racist nostalgia for the 1950s treatment of Black Americans dumped in Miami swamps. This grotesque history now repeats.

This swamp prison is not a federal facility run by ICE, but a state-run black non-site imprisoning people for political theater with $500 million of Florida taxpayer money annually. Though described by Florida’s attorney general as a “low-cost, temporary detention facility,” the truth is far more sinister.

Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. Florida has no legal authority to detain immigrants simply for being undocumented unless that person is also charged with a state crime or subject to a federal detainer. Even then, a judicial hearing must be held within 48 hours to determine probable cause for arrest. This is guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.

Yet those imprisoned in this Everglades camp hellhole — many with no criminal record — are held indefinitely without charges, hearings or meaningful access to legal counsel. That is not immigration enforcement; this is state-sponsored kidnapping.

In holding immigrants as political pawns, DeSantis’ message is clear: cruelty is intended. The suffering and neglect should horrify every American.

The facility floods routinely. Toilets often don’t flush. The food is scarce, often a sandwich. Medical care is nonexistent.

This is not a detention facility. It is a constitutional crime scene.

There is no space for attorney-client meetings. Lawyers are turned away or forced to communicate through fences and chain-link barriers — in plain violation of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel. The state of Florida ignores these protections and in response activists have begun filing suit.

Moreover, the Everglades — home to endangered species and a UNESCO World Heritage site — is environmentally and culturally desecrated.

The Miccosukee and Seminole peoples, who have lived in harmony with their sacred land for centuries, now fight back — suing to block the project because it violates environmental law and their sovereign treaty rights. One lawsuit this week prompted a temporary stop to construction at the camp.

But DeSantis has bulldozed ahead, prioritizing ideology over ecology and cruelty over conservation. Even ICE — not known for its compassion — has distanced itself from this disaster, confirming that this is not a federal facility. If that is true, then ICE has no legal oversight, and detention is occurring outside any authorized federal immigration process. Thus, those imprisoned here are held solely by the state of Florida, which cannot incarcerate people who have not committed a state crime.

This is not a gray area but a flashing red alert. The Constitution allows only the federal government to detain for immigration enforcement, and even then, only within the bounds of due process. Even if Florida claims to hold undocumented immigrants on ICE’s behalf, it is in direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.

This is the time for bold legal action. Every person detained is entitled to immediate release or a judicial hearing. Lawyers should file habeas corpus petitions in federal court now. Civil rights lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 should be brought against every Florida official responsible. The Justice department should open a civil rights investigation. Congress must hold hearings.

And if this facility is allowed to stand — if the courts do not act, if the public does not resist — then it will not be the last. The architecture of tyranny is modular.

This is not just about immigration; this is a moral disgrace, an environmental catastrophe, a violation of tribal sovereignty and a constitutional abomination. It must be shut down.

The Constitution applies everywhere — even in the Everglades. Justice cannot be confined by geography or politics.

If you or someone you know is detained in this facility, fight back with every legal tool available. Our democracy depends on standing up to unlawful detention and demanding accountabilitybefore more lives are needlessly destroyed in this swamp of injustice.",https://www.miamiherald.com/public/latest-news/lswys3/picture309972315/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/MIA_2025-07-03AD1629Alligat,N,,2025-08-09 18:56:51.051092

The U.S. immigration system is irreparably broken.","If you commit the “crime” of speaking Spanish in Indiana, watch your back. The Indiana State Police and Indiana National Guard are looking for you.

Gov. Mike Braun recently announced the Indiana State Police, Indiana Department of Correction and the Indiana Department of Homeland Security will join the Indiana National Guard in assisting the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement roundup of immigrants into the United States.

Braun said the state will make 1,000 beds available in the Miami Correctional Facility to imprison people who have been convicted of nothing and have been given no due process rights. The Marion County sheriff has said he will go along with the order, in part because the federal government pays him per detainee, while the state does not.

This is an affront to anyone who values liberty, limited government and human dignity. It wastes police resources — and Hoosiers’ tax money — in diverting them from searching for and prosecuting crimes against person and property by actual criminals to instead round up peaceful people who are seeking a better life. Immigrants work in our farms, factories and communities, shop at our stores, and contribute positively to our state’s economy and culture.

It’s also a gross violation of the words Braun said on Jan. 13, when he placed his hand on a Bible and swore an oath to God and the people of Indiana that he would uphold and defend both the Indiana and United States Constitutions.

Participating in President Trump’s scheme to systematically dismantle due process and the rule of law is a clear violation of that solemn oath.

While Braun and Trump claim this is a roundup of “violent illegal immigrants,” the witch hunt has gone far beyond that. Of those being arrested, 71% have no criminal convictions at all — and among those who do, most are for minor offenses — and only 8% have been convicted of violent crimes. The number of those without any conviction being arrested and detained keeps rising.

However, Trump has been eager to not just deport the “violent” criminals, but to round up anyone who is Latino, Asian or Middle Eastern, treating everyone as a potential illegal immigrant, to meet the quota of 3,000 arrests per day vocalized by White House adviser Stephen Miller, while the administration gleefully touts deplorable conditions in detention centers and violates due process rights.

To desperately reach that goal, it means rounding up people who aren’t criminals, but who have fled oppressive communist and socialist regimes and lawfully sought asylum, revoking visas and green cards for students without explanation, and sweeping up U.S. citizens and throwing them in jail.

People showing up for their visa appointments — doing the right thing in good faith — are being arrested in court and taken to faraway detention facilities where they know nobody and have little chance of contacting representation. One was a 20-year-old Purdue student from South Korea who was on an active student visa, but arrested, detained and shipped to Louisiana at her hearing.

This is the work of a banana republic, not a republic bound by a Constitution that has a very clear mandate to protect due process rights and a tradition of “innocent until proven guilty.”

Participating in such a system — and actively and enthusiastically doing so — is denying people their dignity, as well as their human rights.

As Libertarians, we believe in the sovereignty of the individual and the freedom to live, work and move in peace.

A state government deputizing local and state officers to participate in a federal scheme of rounding up people for the sole crime of looking different or speaking with an accent, on the hopes of “finding illegals,” violates that principle. It undermines state sovereignty and also sows distrust between our immigrant communities and local authorities.

The U.S. immigration system is irreparably broken. It is a Byzantine system with a number of hoops and steps someone must jump through to legally immigrate to the U.S., which incentivizes “illegal immigration,” and the Trump administration has doubled down on it by not only making legal immigration more difficult, but revoking visas and arresting and deporting people going through the process the right way for small paperwork errors.

Truly making America great would be living up to the words on the Statue of Liberty — “give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free” — not weaponizing local police to kidnap, detain and deport people trying to properly follow the system, while revoking visas and making the immigration system more difficult.

The Libertarian Party of Indiana calls for Gov. Braun to revoke this promise, to not allow Indiana prisons to be used to detain people who are not criminals, and to honor our tradition of federalism by refusing to comply with the federal authorities carrying out these heinous acts, while we call on the federal government to offer a bridge, not an alligator-infested moat, to those seeking a better life in the great melting pot of the United States.

Ge was detained at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center (MVPC) in Phillipsburg, PA, in ICE custody for five days and was awaiting a hearing before the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. MVPC staff discovered Ge hanging by the neck and unresponsive, and immediately lowered him to the ground, began CPR, and contacted Phillipsburg Emergency Medical Services, the Pennsylvania State Police, and the coroner’s office, according to ICE.

While around 10 protesters stood outside the ICE field office, two vans left the building at 3:18 p.m., protected by a dozen uniformed ICE officers. In the past, these vans have been used to transport immigrants from the holding center inside 630 Sansome St., to longer-term detention facilities elsewhere in the state or country.

The officers pointed less-lethal pepperball rifles and batons at protesters, and the vans successfully departed in under a minute.

Confrontations between protesters and ICE vans at 630 Sansome St. have resulted in violent clashes in the past, with officers driving a van through protesters on July 8. But today, the ICE agents retreated into the garage that they had just exited, disappearing under the closing door, seeming to mock protesters by waving goodbye and shaking what appeared to be pepper-spray cans, in a video obtained by Mission Local.

As some protesters dispersed, others continued yelling outside the garage door. Mission Local has not been able to obtain video of the next two minutes, but protesters who were present, and have asked to remain anonymous, report that ICE agents fired pepperballs under the garage door at approximately 3:21 p.m.

Shortly thereafter, video shows ICE agents sprinting out of the field office. One protester is swiftly tackled by an ICE officer, who then cuffs him with the help of another.

Another officer, wearing a vest belonging to the Enforcement and Removal Operations division of ICE, then pulls a female protester onto the ground, before cuffing her.

The ICE officers then brought the two protesters through the side door of 630 Sansome St., while other officers pointed Tasers at protesters who attempted to approach them.

According to one protester, Lea, the female protester was a San Francisco resident and a community organizer for homelessness support networks in the city. “It’s horrible,” Lea said. “She has a huge heart.”

They didn’t know the identity of the man who was detained, but worried about what would happen to both of them, once they were brought into federal custody.

Immigration issues are complex. Discussing them is challenging, since key terms are often conflated and confused.

Clarifying these terms and their legal implications can help ensure people are talking about the same things – regardless of whether they agree about who should be in the country.

Some key immigration-related terms

Let’s start with terms describing different aspects of immigration.

Immigrant is a common term meaning a foreign national who intends to remain in the U.S. or another country where they weren’t born.

Migrant is a generic term that doesn’t have any specific legal meaning and is often used incorrectly as a synonym for immigrant.

Immigrants are considered documented if they’ve been issued an immigrant visa or a green card, thereby achieving lawful permanent resident status. Green cards and visas can be revoked – typically a consequence of certain criminal convictions. Visas allow foreign nationals to travel to a U.S. port of entry and request permission to enter but do not guarantee entry.

A lawful permanent resident generally can apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. This process is known as naturalization. In fiscal year 2024, 818,500 people were naturalized.

Once naturalized, revocation of U.S. citizenship – or denaturalization – is rare, traditionally resulting from fraud, omission during the application process or other extraordinary causes. Between 1990 and 2017, about 11 people annually had their naturalized citizenship revoked.

The Trump administration is reportedly expanding the scope of denaturalization and is being called out for allegedly weaponizing it against current political adversaries such as Elon Musk. However, denaturalization numbers remain low. The first Trump administration filed 102 denaturalization cases, and his current administration has filed five so far, according to NBC News.

In May 2025 – a typical month representing some of the most recent data available – about 47,000 immigrants entered the U.S. with one of the many kinds of immigrant visas. For example, the visas may be used for family-based immigration, including legitimate marriages to U.S. citizens and international adoptions. Immigrant visas are also available for employment-based immigration, including foreign nationals who invest substantial capital in the U.S. economy.

An array of nonimmigrant visas

Apart from immigrant visas, a variety of nonimmigrant or temporary visas are available.

For instance, there are visas for international students, although the Trump administration has expressed its intention to significantly restrict availability.

There are visas to facilitate travel and tourism, business, temporary workers, and for those with extraordinary abilities or achievements.

There are special visas for victims of human trafficking and other crimes who assist law enforcement.

There are even visas to facilitate international sports competitions.

In fiscal year 2024, the U.S. issued a record 8.5 million visitor visas. Stays are generally limited to six months.

In addition, visitors from more than 40 countries are allowed to travel to the U.S for tourism or business for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa.

Significantly, a foreign national entering the U.S. with a visitor visa, also known as a tourist visa, isn’t authorized to work.

What it means to be ‘undocumented’

The term undocumented essentially refers to people who didn’t obtain a green card or a visa – or stayed in the U.S. after their documents expired. An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the U.S.

People in Los Angeles rally in support of undocumented immigrants. Noah Berger/AP PhotoVisa “overstays” represent approximately 40% of the undocumented population. As a matter of law, such overstays are civil rather than criminal violations.

Attracting more political attention are foreign nationals who cross U.S. borders outside of an authorized checkpoint without asserting a credible claims for asylum. The Border Patrol recorded an historic high of 249,741 encounters with such migrants in December 2023. That figure dropped 77% by August 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.

The Trump administration’s deployment of the U.S. military at the border has reportedly further reduced the number of encounters to the lowest level in decades, but questions regarding the legality of the deployment remain unanswered.

The Trump administration is also encouraging voluntary departure by offering travel assistance and $1,000 to “illegal aliens” who self-deport.

Being undocumented can be legal

Being undocumented doesn’t necessarily mean a foreign national is in the U.S. illegally.

Some foreign nationals are admitted into the country without documentation. Asylum-seekers, also known as asylees, are people fleeing persecution in their home countries. They generally must present themselves to federal immigration authorities at a port of entry, or after entering the country by other lawful means, and eventually substantiate their claims.

The Trump administration’s action to ban asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border was recently limited by a federal appellate court. The court’s decision effectively curtails the administration’s practice of deporting people to places where they could be tortured or persecuted, subject to any further consideration by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Migrants escaping desperate economic circumstances are not eligible for asylum.

Refugees, like asylum-seekers, are fleeing a well-founded fear of persecution in their home countries and are protected under the 1951 Refugee Convention as amended by its 1967 Protocol. This identifies five forms of persecution for relief – race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. In 1980, Congress passed and President Jimmy Carter signed the Refugee Act, which incorporated these international standards into U.S. law.

Unlike asylum-seekers, refugees apply for relief and substantiate their claims through the United Nations. They generally don’t get to choose whether or where they may be resettled.

Refugees and people granted asylum may seek lawful permanent resident status and eventually apply for U.S. citizenship.

In 2024, the U.S. accepted about 100,000 of an estimated 43 million refugees worldwide. Refugees are among the 122 million estimated to be forcibly displaced worldwide.

With limited exceptions, the Trump administration has suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and narrowed relief for women seeking protection from domestic and sexual violence in their home countries.

Humanitarian parole and TPS

Foreign nationals admitted into the U.S. as humanitarian parolees are undocumented initially, but their presence is authorized.

The federal government has historically used humanitarian parole to facilitate the admission of people from countries confronting significant violence or other compelling humanitarian crises when other processes are unavailable, overwhelmed or simply too slow.

For example, the U.S. launched a new humanitarian parole initiative in late 2022 to admit foreign nationals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Humanitarian parole also was used to admit foreign nationals following U.S. intervention in Vietnam and in Iraq after 9/11; after American troops withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021; and following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Those granted temporary protected status, or TPS, by the federal executive branch are also believed to face extraordinary dangers if they return to their home countries. However, TPS can be granted only to foreign nationals who are already present in the U.S.

Generally, the federal executive branch has discretion to rescind both humanitarian parole and TPS, subject to certain rule-making requirements, if it concludes recipients can return safely to their home countries.

The Trump administration signaled its intent to terminate humanitarian parole and TPS broadly.

DACA recipients, or Dreamers, who arrived in the country without authorization as children, represent another protected category of undocumented foreign nationals legally living in the U.S. However, their status is uncertain due to ongoing litigation.

While ICE receives unprecedented levels of funding and embarks on a hiring spree, the Trump administration has shredded virtually every other federal agency and fired thousands of federal workers.
When it comes to FEMA, President Trump has said that disaster relief work should fall to the states and that he plans to eliminate the agency altogether.
President Jimmy Carter created FEMA in 1979, and in 2003, it was moved to DHS.
“We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June.","On August 5, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, told approximately 100 staffers that they had been reassigned to Immigration and Customs Enforcement — and that if they refused to comply with their reassignment, they could be fired.

The American Prospect published a copy of the email.

“If you choose to decline this reassignment, or accept but fail to report for duty, you may be subject to removal from Federal service as provided in 5 U.S.C. § 7513,” the email reads.

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson told The American Prospect that “select FEMA employees will temporarily be detailed to ICE for 90 days to assist with hiring and vetting” of new ICE agents. The department has said it plans to hire 10,000 new agents, and is offering new recruits a signing bonus of up to $50,000 and student loan forgiveness of up to $60,000. Although the agency claims it’s been inundated with applications, soon after launching the recruitment campaign, DHS removed age restrictions on all positions. During an appearance on Fox & Friends, Noem encouraged 18-year-olds to apply.

“We want to wean off of FEMA, and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June. “A governor should be able to handle it, and frankly, if they can’t handle it, the aftermath, then maybe they shouldn’t be governor.”

In April, the Trump administration eliminated FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, and sought to reallocate $4 billion in unspent funds that Congress had authorized for the program. On August 5, a federal judge temporarily blocked the administration’s plans. The program, the judge wrote in his ruling, “is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives.” An investigation by CBS News revealed that two-thirds of the counties that lost BRIC funding went to President Trump in the 2024 election.

FEMA’s response to the deadly flash floods that tore through Central Texas on July 4 was catastrophic, in part because Noem had instituted a policy that requires her to personally sign off on expenditures over $100,000.

The New York Times reported that DHS let contracts to the companies that staff its disaster relief hotline lapse on July 5, which led to hundreds of contractors being fired. The funding for the call centers was finally restored on July 10, but by then thousands of flood victims had been unable to access assistance from the hotline. An NPR investigation revealed that on July 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 FEMA answered just over 15,000 of the approximately 55,000 calls it received.

“Put yourself in the shoes of a survivor: You’ve lost everything, you’re trying to find out what’s insured and what’s not, and you’re navigating multiple aid programs,” Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, told the Times. “One of the most important services in disaster recovery is being able to call someone and walk through these processes and paperwork.”

During this time, on July 6, Noem posted images of herself on Instagram, The Daily Beast reported. She asked her followers: “Which one do you like for the official Governor’s portrait to hang in the South Dakota State Capitol?”

Noem also delayed search and rescue efforts. Multiple sources told CNN that Noem did not approve the deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams until July 7, and delayed approving the use of aerial imagery.

Ester Soliman came to the U.S. legally 25 years ago, according to a fundraising page posted online by her family. The page states Soliman, who started her green card application process last year through the sponsorship of her youngest daughter, was detained by ICE at a hearing on Monday.

Posted Thursday night, the fundraiser garnered almost 300 donations and $20,600 in the first 20 hours. The goal is to pay for the family’s legal fees, according to the online post.

“The community's response to this, I hope, helps the Soliman family to know and understand that we are as a community behind them, that we do understand them as our neighbors and our friends,” said state Rep. Izzy Smith-Wade-El, a Democrat whose 49th District includes half of Lancaster city.

Soliman received a notification to appear at an Alternatives to Detention hearing on Aug. 4, where she was detained by ICE. The family did not respond to requests for comment.

ICE uses the Alternatives to Detention program to monitor immigration cases “where detention is not necessary or appropriate,” according to their website.

Soliman is currently being held at the Clinton County Correctional Facility, an over two-and-a-half-hour drive from Lancaster. Administrators at the facility confirmed her detention, though she did not appear in the online ICE detainee lookup tool as of Friday afternoon.

ICE did not respond to questions about why Soliman was detained or why she was not in the public lookup system by the time of publication.

Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace said she was shocked to hear how Soliman was arrested. Both she and Smith-Wade-El said they know Ester Soliman’s son, Sam Soliman, through city events where he attends as a photographer.

“The City of Lancaster is a tight-knit community and we care about our neighbors,” Sorace said. “Esther is a neighbor and she has been for a very long time. She's raised her three children here. They're part of our community.”

Both Smith-Wade-El and Sorace said they advised the family to contact their elected federal officials, as ICE is a federal agency. Smith-Wade-El said he reached out to the offices of U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker, a Republican. Fetterman’s office did not respond to questions by the time of publication.

A spokesperson for Smucker, Eric Reath, said the congressman’s office “is not able to publicly comment on actions we take to assist constituents” without their written approval, according to federal law.

Details of both cases were shared on X by Kyle Cheney, senior legal affairs reporter for Politico.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice for comment on Saturday outside of regular office hours via email and press inquiry form respectively.

Why It Matters

With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress as well as the White House the courts have emerged as one of the main impediments to Trump administration policy.

The administration has suffered a number of prominent legal defeats including courts striking down punitive measures introduced by Trump against law firms involved in proceedings against him, blocking a bid to strip thousands of Haitian migrants of legal protection and removing sanctions aimed at International Criminal Court employees.

Release of Salam Maklad

U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer Thurston, of the Eastern District of California, on Friday instructed the release of Salam Maklad, a Syrian from the Druze religious minority who arrived in the United States in 2002 without valid entry documents and claimed asylum, according to court documents seen by Newsweek.

Maklad went on to marry a man who was granted asylum, which her legal team argued made her eligible for legal immigration status.

On July 9, Maklad was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers after arriving for what she believed was a routine ""check-in"" meeting and subsequently placed in ""expedited removal proceedings"" seeking to deport her from the U.S.

Thurston noted that Maklad had no criminal history and wasn't considered a flight risk, and concluded that ""the balance of the equities and public interest weigh in favor of Ms. Maklad."" Consequently she ordered her release from custody and said authorities are blocked from rearresting her ""absent compliance with constitutional protections, which

include at a minimum, pre-deprivation notice—describing the change of circumstances

necessitating her arrest—and detention, and a timely bond hearing.""

Domestic Violence Funding

Friday also saw Senior District Judge William Smith of Rhode Island rule the Trump administration couldn't impose fresh conditions on funds granted by the Violence Against Women Act due to the president's Executive Order 14168 titled ""Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.""

This funding is distributed by the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women.

Trump's order stated that sex is a person's ""immutable biological classification as male or female,"" and that the federal government should ""prioritize investigations and litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms"" associated with this position.

The Office on Violence Against Women updated its policy on what constitutes ""out of scope activities,"" and therefore should not be funded by its grants, after this order was issued in ""approximately May 2025,"" according to the court filing.

This added spending on ""inculcating or promoting gender ideology as defined

in Executive Order 14168"" to the prohibited list.

The case was brought by a coalition of 17 nonprofit groups which argued adhering to President Trump's position on gender was impeding their ability to assist victims of domestic violence.

Judge Smith backed the coalition's position concluding that the fresh requirements imposed by the Trump administration ""could result in the disruption"" of services for victims of domestic and sexual violence.

What People Are Saying

In the California case Judge Thurston ruled: ""Respondents are PERMANENTLY ENJOINED AND RESTRAINED from re[1]arresting or re-detaining Ms. Maklad absent compliance with constitutional protections, which include at a minimum, pre-deprivation notice—describing the change of circumstances necessitating her arrest—and detention, and a timely bond hearing.

""At any such hearing, the Government SHALL bear the burden of establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that Ms. Maklad poses a danger to the community or a risk of flight, and Ms. Maklad SHALL be allowed to have her counsel present.""

In his ruling Judge Smith wrote: ""On the one hand, if the Court does not grant preliminary relief, then the Coalitions will face real and immediate irreparable harm from the challenged conditions, conditions which the Court has already concluded likely violate the APA.

""This could result in the disruption of important and, in some cases, life[1]saving services to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence. On the other hand, if the Court grants preliminary relief, then the Office will simply have to consider grant applications and award funding as it normally does.""

Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.","A federal judge in Maryland ordered a nationwide halt — again — to a Trump administration order that would have denied citizenship to any baby born in the U.S. after February unless at least one of the parents is a citizen.

The ruling late Thursday by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman is the fourth to block President Donald Trump’s executive order since June, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that judges around the country had exceeded their authority by issuing nationwide stays.

But the justices said lower courts could issue nationwide injunctions if the lawsuits were class-action suits on behalf of all newborns in the U.S. who might be affected by the executive order. Which is what Boardman did Thursday

Boardman rejected a request to include parents in the class-action suit. But she identified a nationwide class of children born on U.S. soil who “unquestionably would be citizens but for the Executive Order,” an order the judge said is “almost certainly unconstitutional.”

She wrote that the plaintiffs — eight undocumented mothers who are pregnant or have children who were born in the U.S. — “are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim because the Executive Order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth amendment,” which says that “all persons” born the U.S. are citizens of the country and of the state in which they were born.

While the immigrants would be harmed in the absence of an injunction, Boardman wrote, there would be little harm to the government to temporarily extending the practice of birthright citizenship that has been recognized in the U.S. for well over a century.

Boardman rejected the government’s argument that she should restrict her injunction just to Maryland.

“That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order. After all, the Executive Order does not target only children born in Maryland; it seeks to deny citizenship to ‘persons born in the United States,’” she wrote.

A government attorney declined to comment Friday on the order, and emails seeking comment from the White House were not immediately returned. But immigrant advocates welcomed Boardman’s order.

“This is a national issue that affects every single one of us in this country,” said Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, which filed suit with the immigrant women.

The Maryland suit was one of several around the country that were filed soon after Trump’s order on “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,” which he issued on Jan. 20, his first day back in office. It claimed that birthright citizenship was never meant to be a universal right, and it said that anyone born after Feb.19 — a month after the order was signed — would be denied citizenship unless one parent was a citizen or permanent legal resident.

The order was swiftly challenges and three judges, including Boardman, issued nationwide injunctions to halt the order. When those were upheld on appeal, the government took the case to the Supreme Court, which said a national injunction could only be issued in class-action suit with a legitimate nationwide class of plaintiffs.

Within hours of that ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court, filing paperwork to turn their case into a class-action suit, adding women from North and South Carolina, among other states as plaintiffs.

Boardman’s approval of a class-action suit, and a national preliminary injunction, comes almost a month after a U.S. District judge in New Hampshire did the same thing.

Frimpong called Trump’s order “just a part of the usual fear tactics to make people afraid of what they believe the federal government will do — even though it will never happen because it is blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional.”

She said she anticipates that the Trump administration will again appeal the decision, but predicts that the case will go through the ordinary course of litigation.

“What we are looking forward to is, once and for all. putting the issue to bed and our courts making absolutely clear that the 14th Amendment is not up for debate, and it’s not up for subjective interpretation,” Frimpong said. “It is the law and it is going to remain the law.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/birthrightminister-1536x1153-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 11:57:39.665459

Congress approved a $170-billion budget for border and immigration enforcement earlier this summer, giving the agency the largest boost in generations.
President Trump wants 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to be hired.
“We don’t know how many U.S. citizens are being detained beyond the media accounts,” he said.","American citizens have been increasingly caught up in the immigration crackdown: a 4-year-old boy with cancer deported to Honduras, a doctoral student filming a raid in Hollywood detained for 25 hours, an Illinois man held for 10 hours in detention.

Increasingly frustrated that the aggressive tactics are sweeping up American citizens, Democratic members of Congress have been pressing for a full accounting of the citizens detained.

On Friday morning 49 Congress members, led by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), and Reps. Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari and two other immigration oversight offices asking them to open an investigation into encounters with American citizens and “determine whether DHS is violating Americans’ civil rights.”

“ICE policy makes clear that, by law ‘ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen,” the legislators wrote. “However, in recent high-profile cases, ICE has erroneously arrested U.S. citizens, at times appearing to use violent physical force.”

“ICE has even deported U.S. citizens: in multiple cases, ICE has deported U.S. citizen children along with their undocumented parents, reportedly against the families’ wishes. Particularly in Latino and Native American communities, Americans increasingly fear that their citizenship will not protect them from being swept up in DHS’s immigration enforcement activities.”

For months Democratic members of Congress have been demanding the Trump administration answer pointed questions, to little avail.

The letters were sent to Cuffari, Troup Hemenway, acting officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and Joseph Guy, director for the Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman. The latter two of those offices have been hollowed out under the Trump administration, which had attempted to abolish them completely.

“The administration owes the American people answers, particularly as Republicans in Congress just approved record funding for immigration enforcement, which threatens to put even more citizens at risk,” said Warren.

The Trump administration has adamantly defended its actions.

“DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted and are not resulting in the arrest of U.S. citizens,” said department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in response to The Times’ inquiry about the number of Americans detained, arrested and deported under the administration.

“We do our due diligence. We know who we are targeting ahead of time,” she said. “If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement are trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability. “

In the case of Romero, the 4-year old with Stage-4 cancer, DHS said at the time that his mother had a final deportation order and said she chose to be deported with her children. Her lawyers contend the mother, who was arrested during a check-in with immigration officials in Louisiana, was never given a choice and was prohibited from talking to lawyers. They filed a lawsuit last month, along with another mother who also was deported with her 2-year-old citizen daughter.

Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, a policy expert at the National Immigration Law Center, said Immigration and Customs Enforcement used to publish data related to citizens booked-in and arrested, but that was mandated through appropriations and is no longer required.

Currently available data show that in fiscal year 2025 there were no citizens deported and seven arrested. There were 3,700 parents of citizens removed and 6,341 arrested. The data are aggregated and do not show the location, reason for enforcement, outcome or length of detention — as lawmakers are asking for.

Whitlock suspects the data are an undercount based on the number of cases she has seen in the media.

The immigration crackdown is expected to expand considerably. Congress approved a $170-billion budget for border and immigration enforcement earlier this summer, giving the agency the largest boost in generations. President Trump wants 10,000 new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents to be hired.

Immigrant advocates fear with more capabilities, enforcement levels will explode and exacerbate encounters with citizens. Already they said, the White House has given agencies wider latitude than they had before.

“We are seeing the agency unleashed like never before,” said Jesse Franzblau, associate director of policy of National Immigrant Justice Center. “ICE is just picking up people, whoever is nearby and there is a lot of racial profiling happening.”

He points to Julio Noriega, a 54-year-old U.S. citizen who was among those picked up in sweeps in early January in Chicago and placed in handcuffs.

Noriega had been looking for work when agents picked him up and took him to an ICE processing center before looking inside his wallet, according to court documents. The Center and the ACLU of Illinois attorneys said he was detained for 10 hours and then released without his arrest ever being documented. Lawyers argued DHS violated a 2022 settlement requiring agents have probable cause to believe that a person is in the country illegally before arresting them and then reporting it.

“We don’t have any transparency about warrantless arrests, we don’t have transparency about how many U.S. citizens are being swept up and being arrested, “ he said. The data on citizen detained, he said, aren’t always being captured.

“We don’t know how many U.S. citizens are being detained beyond the media accounts,” he said. “It’s incumbent on these agencies to produce this information. These are serious issues.”

The letter asks the oversight bodies to provide by Sept. 5 detailed information on stops, arrests, detentions and deportation of citizens including a breakdown by month, location, reason for enforcement action, outcome, and length of time in ICE custody.

“It should send chills down everyone’s spine if just one U.S. citizen is detained without due process during an ICE raid,” said Padilla. “This is not a question of rights of immigrants versus rights of Americans, it’s about ensuring that due process is afforded and protected for everyone, which the 5th Amendment guarantees.”

Debrorah Fleischaker, the former chief of staff at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said verifying somebody’s citizenship can sometimes be complicated, but officials should be explaining how that works.

“It’s not necessarily automatically inappropriate to have arrested or held a U.S. citizen, but they certainly should not be deporting them,” she said.

“My guess is that they are encountering U.S citizens much more often than they have historically just because the scope of their interior enforcement activities are so much larger than they ever have been.”

Eduardo Casas, an attorney for Job Garcia, the doctoral student who was detained after filming a raid at a Home Depot in Hollywood, said he has been asking immigration officials for information about citizens detained and arrested during the Los Angeles sweeps this summer, but has so far been rebuffed.

“They are not being transparent,” said Eduardo Casas, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “We know that citizens are being caught up in this broader enforcement paradigm that centers around mass deportation. The way they try to accomplish mass deportation is by pushing the boundaries of civil liberties in the same way that they’ve done for people like Job.”

Casas said he interviewed other citizens present during raids and a pattern emerged. People filming angered agents, who then arrested them and took them to detention centers.

“They’ll take people as far as detention centers, and then say that you may be charged, and then they let them go,” he said. “It’s also not always a very formal process.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a64aad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+354/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0e%2Fce%2F4b23dce044b5bc1bb845f4d0f269%2F2219079226.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 09:57:01.565475

The center, located on an old airport runway surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, will continue to operate and process immigrants, however.

“We’re pleased that the judge saw the urgent need to put a pause on additional construction, and we look forward to advancing our ultimate goal of protecting the unique and imperiled Everglades ecosystem from further damage caused by this mass detention facility,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, in a news release.

The two-week restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams comes as the court considers a preliminary injunction against the facility.

“Today’s ruling by an activist judge will have no impact on immigration enforcement in Florida. Alligator Alcatraz will remain operational, continuing to serve as a force multiplier to enhance deportation efforts,” Alex Lanfranconi, a Gov. Ron DeSantis spokesperson, posted to social media Thursday afternoon.

The injunction stops filling, paving, new lights, and new infrastructure.

DeSantis previously claimed construction at the facility was temporary and all operations would be carried out using portable units.

Environmental advocacy groups and the Miccosukee Tribe joined together to oppose construction, including pavement laid despite DeSantis’ claims.

“This facility is not only a threat to one of the most environmentally sensitive regions in the country,” Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani said in a news release.

“It is also a glaring example of how far the State of Florida will go to criminalize immigrants and ignore the long-term health of our natural resources. Constructed in direct conflict with the Everglades restoration efforts supported by taxpayers for decades, this project represents both environmental negligence and human rights violations.”

There was a hearing Wednesday about the restraining order.

Plaintiffs including Friends of the Everglades argued the facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Williams took over the case after Judge Jose Martinez recused himself.

The center has been controversial, sparking this and other lawsuits with Democratic lawmakers strongly speaking out against it.

“It’s a relief that the court stepped in to protect the Everglades’ sensitive waters, starry skies, and vulnerable creatures from further harm while we continue our case,” said Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. “We’re ready to press forward and put a stop to this despicable plan for good.”

The center has generated national headlines. President Donald Trump visited the facility last month and the Republican Party of Florida is using the center’s moniker on merchandise while immigrant advocacy groups speak out against conditions inside the facility.

“The detention facility threatens land that is not only environmentally sensitive but sacred to our people,” Talbert Cypress, Cchairman of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida said in the news release.

“While this order is temporary, it is an important step in asserting our rights and protecting our homeland.

Ice said its officers arrested Beainy on 16 May – five years after he launched the first of multiple Trump Burger locations – and placed him into immigration proceedings, an agency statement said.
Trump Burger gained national attention after Beainy opened the original location in Bellville, Texas, in 2020, the same year Trump lost his bid for a second presidential term to Joe Biden.
He sued the landlord of a Trump Burger location in Kemah, Texas, whom Beainy claimed forcibly removed staff and took over the restaurant.
In 2022, Beainy told the Houston Chronicle he endured threats to have Trump Burger burned down when the first one opened its doors.","The owner of a Donald Trump-themed hamburger restaurant chain in Texas is facing deportation after immigration authorities under the command of the president detained him.

Roland Mehrez Beainy, 28, entered the US as “a non-immigrant visitor” from Lebanon in 2019 and was supposed to have left the country by 12 February 2024, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) spokesperson told the Guardian.

Citing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Texas’s Fayette County Record newspaper reported that Beainy applied for legal status after purportedly wedding a woman – but the agency maintained there is no proof he ever lived with her during the alleged marriage.

Ice said its officers arrested Beainy on 16 May – five years after he launched the first of multiple Trump Burger locations – and placed him into immigration proceedings, an agency statement said.

“Under the current administration, Ice is committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission,” the agency’s statement also said.

“This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.”

In remarks to the Houston Chronicle, Beainy denied Ice’s charges against him, saying: “Ninety percent of the shit they’re saying is not true.” He is tentatively scheduled for a hearing in immigration court on 18 November.

Trump Burger gained national attention after Beainy opened the original location in Bellville, Texas, in 2020, the same year Trump lost his bid for a second presidential term to Joe Biden. Replete with memorabilia paying reverence to Trump as well as politically satirical menu items targeting his enemies, Beainy’s chain expanded to other locations, including Houston.

Trump won a second presidency in January, and his administration summarily began delivering on promises to pursue mass deportations of immigrants. Political supporters of Trump in the US without papers, at least in many cases, have not been spared.

One case which generated considerable news headlines was that of a Canadian national who supported Trump’s plans for mass deportation of immigrants – only for federal authorities to detain her in California while she interviewed for permanent US residency and publicly describe her in a statement as “an illegal alien from Canada”.

In another instance, Ice reportedly detained a Christian Armenian Iranian woman who lost her legal permanent US residency, or green card, after a 2008 burglary conviction and incarcerated her at a federal detention facility in California despite her vocal support of Trump. Her husband, with whom she is raising four US citizen children, subsequently blamed the couple’s plight on Biden’s “doing for open borders”, as Newsweek noted.

Beainy’s detention by Ice is not his only legal plight, according to the Houston Chronicle. He sued the landlord of a Trump Burger location in Kemah, Texas, whom Beainy claimed forcibly removed staff and took over the restaurant.

The landlord responded with his own lawsuit accusing Beainy of unpaid debts and renamed the Kemah restaurant Maga Burger.

In 2022, Beainy told the Houston Chronicle he endured threats to have Trump Burger burned down when the first one opened its doors. But the brand had since gained a loyal following and a portion of its profits were set aside to aid Trump’s fundraising, Beainy said to the outlet.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8363812e446f1121d6d93c9d1e54f939fc92f2b0/200_0_2857_2286/master/2857.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d9d1bf9af3a22bbd85346104d76be3b9",N,,2025-08-09 09:57:18.078085

Rising ICE arrests in Washington and nationally The data shows 277 ICE arrests in Washington in June.
National figures compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse show a dip in ICE arrests in July, as public sentiment grew more critical about immigration enforcement.","Since President Donald Trump took office, promising mass deportations, many have been trying to assess exactly how dramatically immigration enforcement has changed in Washington state. Yes, immigration authorities have raided at least two worksites, smashed car windows, roamed immigration court hallways and detained people suddenly summoned to the Department of Homeland Security’s Tukwila office building.

But little has been known about whether the number of arrests and detentions in the state has ramped up as much as Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive tactics. Recently released data from the Deportation Data Project, collected through Freedom of Information Requests by the University of California, provides answers.

The data shows immigration enforcement has indeed scaled up in Washington. Arrests have climbed, most sharply in June, but not as much as they have nationwide. Most of those arrested in Washington and nationwide do not have a criminal record.

Perhaps even more noteworthy, immigrant advocates say, 100% of those arrested in Washington are now spending time detained in jail-like conditions, whereas some used to be released into the community with a form of monitoring, like ankle bracelets or periodic ICE check-ins.

It is striking to me to see such a clear pattern,” said Phil Neff, a researcher with the University of Washington Center for Human Rights, which is often critical of immigration enforcement policies. He tracked the number of local people who were detained through a unique identifier for each person that ICE supplied with the data.

The figures run from September 2023 through late June this year, so they don’t offer a complete comparison of enforcement patterns under Trump versus those under former President Joe Biden. The former president got tougher in some respects as the November 2024 election neared and his immigration policies faced ceaseless criticism from his opponent.

The data is also flawed, with obvious errors such as arrests not attached to Washington despite noted apprehension sites in the state.

Yet even with the data’s limitations, it’s possible to get an overall picture and put recent figures in perspective.

Rising ICE arrests in Washington and nationally

The data shows 277 ICE arrests in Washington in June. That’s more than twice the number of any previous month since Trump took office. The high point of arrests during the last 16 full months of the Biden administration was 202 in September 2023.

On average, the monthly number of ICE arrests in Washington rose from 93 during that period of the Biden administration to 145 so far during Trump’s (not including January, divided between the two presidents, with Trump taking office Jan. 20) – a nearly 56% increase.

Nationally, ICE’s monthly arrest average has more than doubled what it was in Biden’s last 16 full months. A University of California, Los Angeles research center last week released a report fleshing out the wide variation between states in the rate of ICE arrests between February and June. Washington had the second lowest rate, behind Oregon, while Mississippi had the highest rate.

That trend rings true to Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “There is an uptick” of local arrests, he said. “But it’s not like this massive escalation.”

How many arrested in WA have criminal records

Of those ICE has arrested in Washington under Trump, the percentage with criminal convictions has declined from 43% in February to 31% in June, according to the data. An increasing share of those arrested had pending criminal charges during that time. Even so, most of the Washingtonians ICE arrested in June – 57% – had no criminal record.

Some of the criminal charges and convictions could relate to entering or re-entering the U.S. illegally, although such charges are not often brought in Washington as they are in border states like Texas and Arizona, according to Adams. Living in the country without authorization, for example by overstaying a visa, is not a crime.

The data on criminality, reflected in multiple stories of Washingtonians with clean records being arrested, contradicts Trump’s repeated statements that he is targeting immigrants who are the “worst of the worst.”

Asked to respond, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “This data is being cherry picked by the Deportation Data Project to peddle a false narrative. Many of the individuals that are counted as ‘non-criminals’ are actually terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more; they just don’t have a rap sheet in the U.S.”

McLaughlin did not say what evidence the administration had of such criminal activity.

While many have focused on the difference between rhetoric and reality in the current administration, Trump is by no means the first to arrest immigrants without criminal records. Immigration authorities under former President Barack Obama commonly did so before a policy change in his second term.

The Deportation Data Project numbers show the Biden administration did so too. In September 2023, 85% of those arrested by ICE in Washington lacked a criminal record. That number dropped throughout the rest of his term, to just 13% by December 2024. Trump immediately reversed the trajectory.

Changes in how many arrested are then detained

Trump has continued a trend that was underway during the Biden administration: detaining a greater share of people arrested. In September 2023, 27% of those arrested by ICE in Washington were detained. By the end of Biden’s term, 91% were. In June, everyone was.

The increase has contributed to a surge in population at the 1,575-bed Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, which had dropped dramatically during the height of the pandemic as the government scaled back immigration enforcement. The detention center became so full in June that ICE temporarily transferred 41 people to Alaska.

The government is supposed to make detention decisions based on whether immigrants are a danger to the community or a flight risk, noted Adams of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. But in practice, many people have been detained regardless, he said.

“With the big qualifying exception of the COVID period, this has been how immigration detention operates, Adams said. His organization in March filed a lawsuit challenging routine bond denials by most judges at the immigration court housed inside the detention center.

The Deportation Data Project hopes to receive updated state-by-state ICE figures soon. National figures compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse show a dip in ICE arrests in July, as public sentiment grew more critical about immigration enforcement.

""As an organization, we cannot look away and are deeply saddened that this happened.""

The petition says the farmworker fled Guatemala after he was targeted by people who killed his brother.

The petition said L-J-P-L applied for asylum on Feb. 11. His next scheduled immigration court hearing was scheduled for Nov. 18, 2026. He has no criminal history, the petition said.

L-J-P-L was arrested and detained by ICE agents ""despite no material changes in his individual circumstances,"" his attorneys wrote in the court filing.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut issued an order on Aug. 7 saying L-J-P-L cannot be moved outside the District of Oregon without advance notice of the intended move, made in writing and filed with the court.

“ICE is terrorizing the very people who feed our communities, targeting farmworkers in their own neighborhoods on their way to work,” said Reyna Lopez, executive director of Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, Oregon’s farmworker union.

Lopez said people will be scared of working during the peak harvest.

""This not only affects farmworkers’ ability to support their families, but also the many growers who rely on migrant labor and our collective ability to put food on our tables,"" Lopez said.

Each of the three judges on the appellate panel in Washington, D.C., wrote their own opinions, contained in a document published Friday spanning over 100 pages. The upshot is that accountability is not likely to come for anyone in the administration who violated Boasberg’s order.

“The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders — especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” Boasberg wrote in April, finding probable cause that government defendants had violated his order.

That sentiment was echoed by the dissent on Friday, with Judge Cornelia Pillard backing her fellow Obama appointee in writing that the panel majority “does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his effort to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.”

Yet it was Boasberg who overstepped, according to the Trump-appointed judges in the majority, Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao. While noting that the trial judge “was placed in an enormously difficult position” in dealing with fast-paced litigation, Katsas wrote that the government’s conduct “clearly and indisputably was not criminal.” Rao wrote that Boasberg “used the threat of criminal contempt to coerce the Executive Branch to comply with an order it had no authority to enforce.”

Pillard closed her dissent by citing legal principles regarding obeying court orders and the fair administration of justice. “The rule of law means those principles apply to officials in the executive branch just as they apply to all of us,” she wrote.

Watch the full press conference above.

Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García statement

""Secretary Kristi Noem is lying and she knows it. The vast majority of people ICE has detained have no criminal record. ICE has been detaining and deporting hundreds of thousands of working people, mothers with children, student activists, tourists with visas and even U.S. citizens, all to meet the absurd quotas Trump has established, and fulfill the racist immigration policy Stephen Miller is directing.

""This week, Senator Durbin and I led all Democrats in the Illinois Congressional Delegation in a letter demanding an end to unlawful attacks on local policies that build trust between police and keep communities safe.

""Our communities deserve safety, dignity, and respect. Trust between police and neighbors makes us safer, and ICE has no right to take that away. The Trump Administration’s attacks have no basis, and the courts have already thrown out their lawsuit. We’ve told them loud and clear: respect our laws, stop targeting hard-working immigrants, and stop going after our communities.""

Alderman Gilbert Villegas statement

""As Secretary Kristi Noem and Donald Trump continue their discriminatory and unjust reign of terror against our immigrant communities, once again targeting the City of Chicago. Let it not be lost that the reason for this is petty, racist politics - led by the dark money donations of CoreCivic Corp and GEO Group Inc., who gave Donald Trump millions during his campaign and are now getting billions in no-bid contracts for their disgusting detention centers.

""It was never about public safety, and as this administration continues their uptick in antics to distract from the serious issues they are facing, like raising prices on everyday Americans for petty tariffs, covering up Trump in the Epstein files, and dismantling support for our Veterans, they will continue to target the most vulnerable in our country to keep the attention elsewhere. Shame on them.""

The backstory:

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents ""are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.""

Noem said in a post on X that these ""acts of violence are fueled by sanctuary politicians' rhetoric vilifying our law enforcement.""

""We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down. Everyday our law enforcement continues to enforce the law and arrest the most depraved criminals including pedophiles, terrorists, murderers, gang members, and sexual predators,"" she added.

It is unclear what the time period is for the 1000% increase in assaults. The Department of Homeland Security did not clarify the matter when asked about it by Fox News Digital.

In July, Fox News Digital reported that ICE officials faced an 830% increase in assaults between Jan. 21, 2025 and July 14, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.

That timeframe began the day after President Donald Trump returned to the Oval Office.

Noem made the announcement Thursday as the Trump administration is removing the age cap for ICE law enforcement positions, opening up roles to many who may have aged out of the force.

Noem said Wednesday they are looking to make 10,000 hires, and she said ICE has already received 80,000 applications.

""We are ENDING the age cap for ICE law enforcement. Qualified candidates can now apply with no age limit,"" Noem wrote on X.

ICE is seeking to entice more applicants with a signing bonus of up to $50,000, options to repay or forgive student loans and other benefits.

Several groups, including 50501 and NYIC, as well as faith-based groups, were present at the protest.","Several protesters outside New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza government building were arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct, with demonstrators accusing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency of operating a covert detention facility there, according to several reports.

Protesters marched to the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Friday morning and chanted outside the building. Demonstrators demanded access to the site, which was denied, and they later held a sit-in outside the courthouse, according to Hunter Dunn, the press coordinator for the grassroots protest movement known as 50501.

Within a few minutes the New York City police department moved in to arrest about 15 protesters for disorderly conduct, according to Dunn , as activists could be seen blocking the street.

“No fear, no hate, no Ice in our state!” chanted demonstrators during their march to the site, where Ice agents routinely detain immigrants after immigration court proceedings, in a move that goes against previously normal practice.

“They were entirely peaceful,” Dunn told the Guardian. “It is not wrong to demonstrate against illegal, unconstitutional and immoral actions by the federal government.”

Demonstrators allege detainees are being held in overcrowded conditions without many basic amenities or legal access at 26 Federal Plaza’s 10th floor, where the agency denies it detains people, and are demanding unrestricted access for elected officials, journalists and faith leaders. Friday’s protest was one of several in the city this week.

Last month, footage from inside 26 Federal Plaza shared by the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC) showed two dozen men in bare rooms, some lying on the floor with emergency blankets and with few basic provisions.

“Just to be a presence, we’re here to say that the American people are opposed to these kinds of policies. And for Ice agents, maybe that will lead some of them to reconsider their career choice,” Jeffrey Courter, the chair of the Justice Ministries Committee of the Presbytery of New York City, told ABC7.

Authorities insist the facility is only a processing center.

Lawmakers have been denied access to the site. In June, Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, was arrested while escorting an immigrant from a hearing.

The federal case is likely to address two questions: Are the Colorado laws in question constitutional and are they affected by the Supremacy Clause?
There’s also a question whether the county even has standing to sue the state in federal court since a county is a complete creation of the state.
Sounds strange, but Mesa County, the Sheriff’s Office and the attorney general are all angling for the same thing, which is legal certainty.
But if Mesa County doesn’t like the law, the legislature is the best place to change it, not the courts.","But the county had already signaled before Thursday’s filing in federal court that it would use public funds to defend a Mesa County deputy in a lawsuit Weiser filed in state district court last week — stemming from the now-infamous traffic stop of a Utah college student who was later detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Doesn’t that state court case offer the best chance for a deeper review of state law? The federal case is likely to address two questions: Are the Colorado laws in question constitutional and are they affected by the Supremacy Clause? The case could be dismissed summarily without offering any clarity on the issues raised in the federal suit.

In our opinion, the statutes don’t rise to the level of being void for vagueness as a matter of constitutional law. There’s also a question whether the county even has standing to sue the state in federal court since a county is a complete creation of the state.

If the federal lawsuit is DOA, as we suspect it will be, then filing it is nothing more than a partisan exercise, offering Mesa County’s all-GOP commissioner board an opportunity to show some defiance of Colorado’s Democrat-led legislature.

“When Washington open-border policies and Democrat border policies created this crisis, Colorado Democrat leadership made it worse by passing sanctuary laws that tie the hands of law enforcement and side with lawlessness instead of law and order,” Commissioner Bobbie Daniel said earlier this week as the commissioner board contemplated filing the suit.

Weiser announced a lawsuit late last month against MCSO deputy Alexander Zwinck for alleged violations of state law in relation to a June traffic stop he conducted on 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves, in which Zwinck shared Dias Goncalves’ information in a Signal chat with federal agents. She would later be detained and spend 15 days in ICE custody.

State law bars government employees, including law enforcement officers, from sharing information for the purposes of “investigating for, participating in, cooperating with, or assisting in federal immigration enforcement.”

Weiser’s office said it took the action to establish enforceability of the laws on the books — to vindicate the legislature’s intent in passing them. As a civil action, the state’s lawsuit could lead to an injunction, fines or other remedies through litigation, but the AG’s office simply wants an acknowledgment of wrongdoing and a promise it won’t happen again.

Instead the county has chosen an adversarial proceeding.

Sounds strange, but Mesa County, the Sheriff’s Office and the attorney general are all angling for the same thing, which is legal certainty. The AG’s lawsuit and Zwick’s response — which will certainly be a reflection of the county’s position — will provide that.

These kinds of legal questions should be worked out in the course of ordinary litigation, not some Hail Mary claiming a violation of the federal Constitution. But if Mesa County doesn’t like the law, the legislature is the best place to change it, not the courts.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gjsentinel.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b32d0574-1b24-11ec-a31e-77e4d5ecaec6.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-08-09 10:57:38.078588

Many fear the criminal courthouse arrests have created a chilling effect not just for those accused of crimes, but for victims as well.
NPR spoke to more than a dozen immigration lawyers, criminal defense lawyers and prosecutors in multiple states where criminal court arrests have taken place.
But victims and witnesses' willingness to participate in criminal court proceedings especially worries prosecutors.","Samantha French was at the Maywood Courthouse in Cook County, Ill., when she noticed a group of men in plainclothes who seemed like they were looking for someone.

""I saw their attention peak when they saw someone walking toward them, and one of them very aggressively went toward this man and grabbed his wrist,"" says French, an assistant public defender in the county.

The man's lawyer, Rick Sotorrio, told NPR his client was facing misdemeanor charges for a domestic disturbance in the Chicago suburbs.

""His wife is there, his two kids are there, and as we're starting to leave down the hallway from the actual courtroom, there's like five or six guys standing there,"" Sotorrio says. ""I said, 'What's going on?' And [an officer] goes, 'I work for Homeland Security. We have a warrant for his arrest.'""

Sotorrio and French say they did not see the warrant or any identification. The federal officers arrested the man, and Sotorrio says he is in Mexico. He believes he left the U.S. voluntarily.

In the months since President Trump's second term began, a tactic his administration has increasingly deployed is arresting people at immigration court as they show up for routine hearings.

But arrests like the one in Maywood — at a criminal courthouse — are also happening across the country. Many fear the criminal courthouse arrests have created a chilling effect not just for those accused of crimes, but for victims as well.

NPR spoke to more than a dozen immigration lawyers, criminal defense lawyers and prosecutors in multiple states where criminal court arrests have taken place. Some said they hear about these arrests nearly every day; others, just a few times since Trump took office again. But they all said the fear of it happening has led to growing concern around court appearances.

""It means, to me, the destruction of our judicial system,"" says Brendon Woods, public defender in Alameda County, Calif. ""That might seem to be overdramatic to some people, but when people are coming to court, they expect to be able to litigate their case, fight their case, protect their rights, or come as a victim to court to testify against someone, without the federal government laying siege to them.""

Jason Blank, a criminal defense lawyer in Florida, says one of his clients has chosen not to be present in person at his hearings. The client, a legal permanent resident, Blank says, is concerned he could be deported. Blank is attending on his behalf.

Other lawyers told NPR they worry their clients are feeling pressure to accept plea deals, so they no longer have to appear in court.

Lazaro Salazar, an immigration lawyer in Fresno County, Calif., says it's not just defendants: Immigrant victims and witnesses are afraid to appear too — to testify against someone, for instance, or get a protective order.

""I just recently spoke to somebody who was a victim of road rage,"" Salazar says. ""The aggressor was yelling at her, claiming to call immigration.""

After the man was arrested, police told the woman, who is undocumented, that she might have to testify against him in court.

""She simply is deathly afraid of having to testify. She'd rather let the whole thing go and just let bygones be bygones because she wants nothing to do with the situation,"" Salazar says.

This chilling effect isn't new — police leaders have been concerned for months that ICE tactics are eroding the immigrant population's trust in them. But victims and witnesses' willingness to participate in criminal court proceedings especially worries prosecutors.

""For my purposes, I want justice to happen,"" says Jamie Mosser, the state's attorney in Kane County, Ill. ""If somebody commits a crime, I want to be able to prosecute that person in the way that we should. But I also like to see cases get resolved for victims. And if we have delayed justice, then that just negatively affects them.""

Mosser says arrests at courthouses do happen, but they're usually the result of a crime happening during court proceedings.

""We've had domestic battery cases. We've had stalking cases, things that have happened in the courthouse. It's not abnormal to have something like that happen, especially when you're bringing people together in this courthouse,"" she says. ""This is different, though, because this is more proactive, going to find individuals who are mandated to be here.""

If a defendant is deported, that also makes it harder to prosecute a case, says Tim Cruz, district attorney in Plymouth County, Mass., and president of the National District Attorneys Association.

""It's all contingent upon communication between the local enforcement agencies and the federal enforcement agencies, so that now when there is a serious matter, we can have a conversation about those cases to make sure that somebody is not deported prematurely,"" Cruz says.

""We've been successful, at least for now in Massachusetts, in having conversations with ICE to say, 'Listen, I want to make sure that the right thing happens here. I know you do, too. And I don't think anybody wants people to get away with murder.'""

Cruz said those conversations are rare. Most defendants in the U.S. are facing misdemeanor charges, and immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than their U.S.-born counterparts.

Judges are often less inclined to speak publicly, but after criminal courthouse arrests were documented during Trump's first term, dozens of retired state and federal judges wrote a letter to Ronald Vitiello, the acting ICE director at the time.

""We know that judges simply cannot do their jobs — and our justice system cannot function effectively — if victims, defendants, witnesses and family members do not feel secure in accessing the courthouse,"" the judges wrote in 2018.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc4%2F97%2Fff1d6cf248d6b20fe1f6ab6bdbe7%2Fgettyimages-2228810377.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 07:57:34.696868

Federal authorities in Delaware and Gov. Matt Meyer’s administration have locked horns over a four-month-old subpoena from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for payroll records of 15 businesses suspected of illegally “employing undocumented aliens,’’ U.S. District Court records show.

Most records in the case filed last week in Wilmington are under seal, including the April subpoena and an affidavit by federal Homeland Security Investigations special agent Kimberly Caraway. Records that have been made public in the court file provide the general contours of the battle but not the names of the companies being targeted by ICE.

ICE has been “investigating reports that various businesses” have been breaking immigration hiring laws since February, according to a motion filed last week by Julianne Murray, the interim U.S. Attorney for Delaware, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Claudia Pare.

That’s one month after President Donald Trump began his second term with a pledge to mount a vigorous and sustained crackdown on illegal immigration. Raids and roundups by ICE agents, and subsequent deportations, have occurred frequently across the country, including a controversial effort in Los Angeles that saw Trump federalize and deploy the California National Guard and deploy U.S. Marines to the nation’s second-largest city.

The motion by Murray and Para sought to seal the subpoena to the state Department of Labor and Caraway’s affidavit. The subpoena sought “the production of wage reports for the third and fourth quarters of 2024 for fifteen Delaware businesses” that were identified “by their names, addresses, and file numbers,” the motion said.

The federal prosecutors wrote that Caraway explained in her subpoena that “wage reports can be useful to HSI’s investigation” because getting them covertly from the state “does not alert the business that they are under investigation.”

Should a company suspected of breaking the law “become aware they are under investigation, they may take action to negatively influence the investigation, including fabricating records and firing employees,’’ Murray and Pare wrote.

Murray was chair of the Delaware Republican Party until last month, when fellow Republican Trump made her the state’s chief federal law enforcement officer, at least for now. Murray, a former candidate for Delaware attorney general and governor, has not been formally nominated for the post, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

Murray declined to comment through a spokesperson.

U.S. District Court Judge Colm Connolly consented to Murray and Pare’s motion to keep the subpoena and Caraway’s affidavit under seal.

The prosecutors want Connolly to enforce the subpoena for the businesses’ records, but an attorney for the Department of Labor told him in court this week that the state will be contesting it.

The judge has ordered the state and Murray’s office to file written arguments in support of their positions within the next two weeks. Connolly, a Republican and former U.S. attorney for Delaware, has given no indication when he would rule.

Meyer, a Democrat, issued a statement condemning the subpoena.

“Since taking office in January, our administration has consistently prioritized protecting Delawareans from federal overreach that undermines our core values of fairness, dignity, and community trust,’’ Meyer said. “The recent federal subpoena directed at the Department of Labor is precisely the kind of government intrusion that we have fought against. Hard-working Delawareans deserve to have their rights and privacy protected. Delaware will continue to uphold the law, protect individual rights, and promote a compassionate and inclusive state for every resident.”

Hard-working Delawareans deserve to have their rights and privacy protected. Delaware will continue to uphold the law, protect individual rights, and promote a compassionate and inclusive state for every resident.”

Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order targeting “sanctuary cities,” where cooperation with federal immigration enforcement is limited. This week, the Dept. of Justice published a list of jurisdictions that would face litigation as DOJ works “closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.”

That list includes the entire state of Delaware and other nearby locations including Philadelphia and Baltimore County, Maryland.

The lawsuit was filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys.
On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the court order barring federal agents from making immigration arrests.
According to Feldstein Soto’s office, the lawsuit is set for a hearing on a preliminary injunction scheduled on Sept. 24.
If granted, the preliminary injunction could extend the conditions of the temporary restraining order as the case progresses.","LOS ANGELES (CNS) – Thirteen additional cities joined a coalition of municipalities being led by the city and county of Los Angeles against the federal government for allegedly racially profiling and engaging in unconstitutional and unlawful stops during immigration raids across Southern California, L.A. City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto announced today.

During a news conference at City Hall, Feldstein Soto said her office filed an amended complaint adding the cities of Pasadena, Santa Monica, Culver City, Pico Rivera, Montebello, Monterey Park and West Hollywood to their motion to intervene in the case of Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem.

The lawsuit was filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union, Public Counsel and other immigration and civil rights attorneys. Plaintiffs alleged ICE and Customs and Border Protection engaged in “unconstitutional and unlawful stops, roundups and raids without reasonable suspicion or probable cause.”

L.A. County and the city, alongside a coalition of regional municipalities such as Long Beach, Pomona, South Gate, Lynwood, Huntington Park, Paramount, Bell Gardens, Beverly Hills, Anaheim, Santa Ana, Santa Barbara, Carpinteria and Oxnard, quickly filed a complaint and joined plaintiffs.

“Since these illegal raids started in L.A. on June 6, I have maintained that every person in the United States, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to constitutional protection from the types of enforcement activities we have seen,” Feldstein Soto said.

“We will always stand up to protect our communities and to uphold the rule of law.”

Santa Barbara Mayor Randy Rowse emphasized that ICE raids have caused widespread disruption across Santa Barbara County and neighboring communities.

“These actions have discouraged community participation, reduced access to essential services and negatively impacted the local economy,” Rowse said. “The city is particularly troubled by the use of masked law enforcement officers, which has raised concerns about false detainment by impersonators and undermined public trust.”

“While the city supports the enforcement of established laws, it strongly objects to the methods being used and is filing a petition to intervene in Vasquez Perdomo et al. v. Noem et al., joining other jurisdictions in defending constitutionally protected rights and ensuring accountability in enforcement practices,” Rowse added.

A Los Angeles federal court previously issued a temporary restraining order against the federal government to refrain from conducting so-called “roving raids.”

The roving raids targeting car washes, parking lots where day laborers gather and garment factories disrupted immigrant communities throughout the region for weeks in June and July, causing widespread fear.

Last week, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the federal government’s request to reverse the order prohibiting federal agencies — including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security — from continuing what U.S. District Judge Maame E. Frimpong determined were unlawful actions in Los Angeles and surrounding counties.

On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the court order barring federal agents from making immigration arrests.

“This case involves a district-court injunction that threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws in the Central District of California by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop of suspected illegal aliens,” according to the Justice Department’s application to the Supreme Court to stay the lower court order.

The high court will decide whether to grant emergency relief pending further litigation.

According to Feldstein Soto’s office, the lawsuit is set for a hearing on a preliminary injunction scheduled on Sept. 24.

She said it seems like conditions should be improving but they “are deteriorating.”

“It seems counterintuitive that should happen unless it’s willful,” said Gee, who was nominated to the court by President Barack Obama.

McCroskey said some children are being held for longer because Trump as part of his crackdown ended the Biden administration’s policy that allowed expedited releases of immigrants. McCroskey also pointed to logistical challenges that resulted from the closure of temporary facilities that were set up under President Joe Biden to handle an influx of immigrants.

In May, CBP held 46 children over a week, including six children held for over two weeks and four children held 19 days, according to data revealed in a court filing. In March and April, CPB reported that it had 213 children in custody for more than 72 hours. That included 14 children, including toddlers, who were held for more than 20 days in April.

Advocates for immigrant children asked the judge to keep protections and oversight in place and submitted accounts from immigrants in Texas family detention centers who described adults fighting children for clean water, despondent toddlers and a child with swollen feet who was denied a medical exam. The advocates also want the judge to expand independent monitoring.

“I have met children who have spent days in jail cells with barely more than ramen noodles to eat, lights on day and night, no sunlight or access to the outside world and the indignity of using the restroom in front of guards. On top of that trauma — then to be flown to family detention and locked up with no end in sight? It is truly shameful,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights, said in an interview after the hearing.

The Flores agreement, named for a teenage plaintiff, was the result of over a decade of litigation between attorneys representing the rights of immigrant children and the U.S. government over widespread allegations of mistreatment in the 1980s. It governs the conditions for all immigrant children in U.S. custody, including those traveling alone or with their parents.

In its written motion, the Trump administration said the government has made substantial changes since the agreement was formalized in 1997, creating standards and policies governing the custody of immigrant children that conform to legislation and the agreement.

The administration is looking to expand immigration detention space, including by building more centers like one in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where a lawsuit alleges detainees’ constitutional rights are being violated. In court, an attorney for the government, Tiberius Davis, acknowledged that the agreement hampers the administration’s efforts, even though Trump’s tax and spending bill provided billions to build new immigration facilities.

Davis said the bill gives the government authority to hold families in detention indefinitely. “But currently under the Flores settlement agreement, that’s essentially void,” he said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa2%2F88%2F586cdc034fe8871019e3e7c98ae9%2Fimmigration-deportations-third-countries-60231.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 04:56:32.519975

Its officers have more particularized suspicion based on their experience and on additional observed facts about the setting and the suspect, ICE argued.
Immigrant advocates greeted Frimpong’s order ecstatically, immediately grasping its implications for immigration enforcement.
Race and sex are irrelevant to the validity of a client’s case or to the opportunities for prosecuting a client’s case.
Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in Perdomo v. Noem, Frimpong’s double standard regarding ICE and her own courtroom exemplifies how the elite establishment has treated race up to now.","The Justice Department just filed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court to vindicate its authority to enforce immigration law. A federal judge in Los Angeles had declared ICE’s questioning of suspected illegal aliens unconstitutional. U.S. District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled on July 11 that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had been impermissibly using race to decide whom to detain for questioning about immigration status. Yet Frimpong’s rules for litigating in her courtroom are themselves a violation of the principle of color-blindness.

According to the plaintiffs in Pedro Vasquez Perdomo v. Kristi Noem, ICE’s immigration operations in Southern California single out suspects based on race and three additional factors: a Spanish accent or inability to speak English; presence at a location, such as a day laborer pick-up site, known to harbor illegal aliens; and working at a job, such as at a car wash, known to be dominated by illegal aliens. Frimpong ruled that those four factors, alone or in combination with the other three, did not provide ground, known as “reasonable suspicion” in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, for stopping and questioning a suspect for illegal presence.

ICE had disputed the advocates’ characterization of its stops. Its officers have more particularized suspicion based on their experience and on additional observed facts about the setting and the suspect, ICE argued. Frimpong’s rushed briefing and hearing schedule had not provided the government sufficient time to make its defense, the Justice Department attorneys alleged, to no effect.

Frimpong issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) blocking ICE from using the four factors of race, language, location, and job type in deciding whom to detain for questioning, unless agents have additional grounds for suspicion. The TRO covers the counties of Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo—a huge area containing an estimated 1.5 million illegal aliens. Though Frimpong held that the four banned factors may in theory be used in tandem with other factors, her order in essence shuts down ICE’s ability to question suspects in her district.

The four factors describe the core situation of many illegal alien workplaces. That is not an artifact of the Trump administration’s allegedly biased views; those factors are objective features of the illegal alien subculture, which is now, as a practical matter, virtually off limits to government investigation. The opinion invites a constitutional challenge to any attempted deportation of an illegal alien who fits the profile of a Hispanic Spanish-speaker working at a location known to rely on illegal labor.

On August 1, a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld Frimpong’s decision. The panel coyly noted that if ICE is not, as it claims, conducting unconstitutional stops, it should not object to being enjoined from conducting unconstitutional stops—a silly simplification of how litigation and judicial power operate that would apply to every injunction.

Immigrant advocates greeted Frimpong’s order ecstatically, immediately grasping its implications for immigration enforcement. Mark Rosenbaum, for decades a lawyer with the ACLU of Southern California and now with Public Counsel, a public interest firm, called it “the most important decision in the history of the country about limitations on what immigration authorities can do when they carry out operations.”

President Donald Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, by contrast, called the ruling “another act of insurrection against the United States and its sovereign people.”

The Supreme Court has ordered the plaintiffs in Perdomo v. Noem to respond to the government’s emergency appeal by August 12. In the meantime, Judge Frimpong’s own relationship to race and government action deserves scrutiny. Frimpong has officially declared her “strong commitment” to fostering “diverse lawyers.” The standing order governing litigation in Frimpong’s courtroom states that she “strongly encourages” litigants to assign to oral argument lawyers “whose identities and/or backgrounds further the diversity of the legal profession.” Frimpong adds that the client ultimately decides who speaks on its behalf. But a litigant who brings a team of lawyers chosen on meritocratic grounds alone will worry if its “non-diverse” lawyers face off against black or Hispanic attorneys. A law practice that wants to avoid any possibility of judicial partiality will favor “intersectional” candidates over white male attorneys for oral argument .

Frimpong is herself likely the beneficiary of racial preferences. She was nominated to the bench by President Joe Biden, who was explicit before and after his election about his intention to appoint nonwhites, especially black females, to the federal judiciary. The Biden White House announced early on that it would not submit Biden’s judicial nominees to the American Bar Association for preclearance, since the ABA did not sufficiently value “diversity.” This claim was absurd; the ABA obsesses about racial proportionality. The preclearance policy amounted to a confession that the White House would be lowering standards beyond even what the ABA could stomach in its own quest for diversity. Seventeen percent of Biden’s judges were black females, a large increase over the estimated 2 percent of American lawyers who are black female. That eightfold disparity would be magnitudes larger if one limited the benchmark to the percentage of black female lawyers who are judicial caliber—a minute subset of any group of lawyers.

Decades ago, a few maverick judges expressed a preference for “diverse” attorneys in large, multidistrict class-action lawsuits. Since 2020, that practice has picked up steam and has gone beyond the tort context. In 2024, America First Legal filed a judicial misconduct complaint against three Illinois district court judges for offering to provide extra oral argument time to female and minority attorneys. Two of the Illinois judges took down their pro-diversity orders in March 2024 in response to the complaint; the third, a Trump appointee, had already done so at the time that the complaint was filed.

Frimpong’s caveat about the choice of attorney ultimately residing with the client is intended to insulate her preference for diverse attorneys from challenge. But her standing order creates at the least the appearance of impropriety. Race and sex are irrelevant to the validity of a client’s case or to the opportunities for prosecuting a client’s case. By contrast, the factors that Frimpong has declared presumptively off limits for deciding whether to question a suspected illegal alien are logically and empirically related to illegal presence in the country. That does not mean that those factors are coterminous with illegal presence: some legal residents will fall into the four categories, and some illegal residents will not. But as a matter of common sense, they are a reasonable component of a decision to stop someone for questioning. As the government notes, when there is a one-in-ten probability that someone chosen randomly from the general population of Frimpong’s Central District is subject to deportation, the proscribed four factors, which describe the core illegal alien population, should support reasonable suspicion for a brief stop at least in some circumstances.

Fourth Amendment jurisprudence long since evolved past the realm of common sense, however, and law enforcement has had to adjust. In this case, the chilling effect on immigration enforcement from Frimpong’s TRO goes beyond what the law requires. The restraining order subjects every immigration “encounter between agents and potential illegal aliens to the threat of contempt,” argues the DOJ in its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court. That chilling effect is precisely the point, of course.

Scrupulousness about the government’s use of race should apply across the board. Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in Perdomo v. Noem, Frimpong’s double standard regarding ICE and her own courtroom exemplifies how the elite establishment has treated race up to now. Dislodging that double standard will be a long battle.

A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.","DENVER ‒ The Trump administration is threatening to sue and withhold federal funds from more than 20 ""sanctuary"" states, cities and counties, because of their lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.""

Inclusion on the list, which includes Democrat-run California and Colorado, but also Republican-led Vermont, comes with the explicit threat of lawsuits and federal funding halts. And border czar Tom Homan has previously promised to ""flood"" those jurisdictions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Several federal judges have blocked the administration's previous efforts to punish some of those jurisdictions, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

Earlier this year, the White House published and then almost immediately withdrew a significantly longer list after many communities on the list said they were erroneously included. In many of the jurisdictions included on the new list, local leaders have argued that allowing police to partner with ICE discourages crime victims and witnesses from coming forward regardless of their immigration status.

In announcing the new list, which also includes both New York City and the state of New York, Chicago and San Francisco, the White House highlighted how Louisville, Kentucky, had agreed to end sanctuary policies while facing threat of a lawsuit.

What is a 'sanctuary jurisdiction'?

There's no specific legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but Bondi's office said it considered things like failure to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, providing government benefits to undocumented immigrants, or refusing to share immigration information about jail detainees.

Federal officials argue local jurisdictions should at the very least honor what are known as ""detainers,"" in which people suspected of immigration violations and who are finishing jail sentences or being released back into the community are instead held until ICE agents come collect them.

In a statement, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg, a Democrat, said he agreed to participate in the detainer system in return for being taken off the sanctuary city list. City officials said the decision would affect about 100 people annually, and that they hoped agreeing to honor detainers would spare the city more aggressive street-level enforcement of the kind that sparked civil unrest in Los Angeles.

""I believe we will best protect our law-abiding community and our entire city by focusing the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions on the few inmates in our jail who have been arrested for committing crimes and are subject to deportation,"" Greenberg said.

Federal courts are currently weighing several lawsuits brought by the Trump administration against jurisdictions on the sanctuary list. A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.

Which communities have been described as immigrant 'sanctuaries'?

According to the Department of Justice, the following communities are offering ""sanctuary"" to immigrants who lack the legal right to be in this country.

United States Attorney General Pam Bondi has said the list could change as cities, counties or states changed policies in the future.

Burden noted that during Trump’s first term in office, his administration attempted to include a citizenship question on census forms.
The bigger effects, Burden said, would be related to federal funding.","President Donald Trump says he’s ordering a new census that will exclude undocumented immigrants for the first time in U.S. history, a move that could have tangible implications for Wisconsin and other states if it were allowed to stand by the courts.

A social media post by Trump early Thursday claimed he’s instructed the U.S. Department of Commerce to “immediately begin work” on a new census “using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.” Trump also said people in the country illegally “WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

According to estimates from the Pew Research Center, there were around 70,000 undocumented immigrants living in Wisconsin as of 2022. The analysis shows California had around 1.8 million undocumented residents, Texas had around 1.6 million and Florida around 1.2 million.

University of Wisconsin-Madison Political Science Professor Barry Burden told WPR it’s unclear whether Trump is talking about excluding undocumented residents before the 2026 midterms or the 2030 census, which has already been in the planning stages for years.

“It seems impossible for a census of any kind to be done in time for the 2026 midterms,” Burden said.

What’s more, Burden said, is the U.S. Constitution has clear language when it comes to when the census is supposed to happen and who gets counted. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution states that residents should be tallied every 10 years, as has been done since the first census in 1790. The 14th Amendment of the Constitution specifies that “the whole number of persons” in each state shall be counted.

Burden noted that during Trump’s first term in office, his administration attempted to include a citizenship question on census forms. A panel of three federal judges in Manhattan unanimously rejected the idea in 2020, stating that the “merits of the parties’ dispute are not particularly close or complicated.” The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but justices dismissed it without ruling on the merits.

If Trump’s administration proceeds with trying to exclude undocumented residents of the U.S. from any census, Burden said it “would probably be tied up in court, maybe until the actual census happens in 2030 anyway.”

“Like so many things that Trump does, it’s possible this post doesn’t actually turn into any real policy actions from the administration,” Burden said. “It might be a way to change the subject from other things that are happening in current affairs that are not as favorable to him.”

Census data is used to determine US House, state legislative representation

Setting aside the political and legal questions, Burden said leaving millions of undocumented residents out of the census could have a range of impacts on Wisconsin. He said one effect might be the allocation of Wisconsin’s House seats.

“If the distribution of (congressional) districts was based only on citizens, some states in the south and the west would lose,” Burden said. “And so that might shift some districts back to the Midwest and the Northeast.”

Burden said it’s not clear that Wisconsin would gain U.S. House seats beyond the eight it has right now.

But Burden said there could be effects on Wisconsin’s 99 state Assembly and 33 state Senate districts if the Legislature were to draw districts using census data excluding people without legal status. In essence, he said parts of Wisconsin could lose legislative seats and others could see gains.

The bigger effects, Burden said, would be related to federal funding. He says many of the formulas to determine federal spending in states are based on census data, “and that includes minors and noncitizens and people who are here on visas and visiting and other kinds of things.”

“If some of those groups were to be excluded, maybe Wisconsin would be advantaged, because there’s some other states with larger numbers of noncitizens that would be affected more dramatically,” Burden said. “It remains to be seen exactly what this post from Trump turns into and whether his plans actually reach that far.”

Wisconsin’s congressional delegation largely silent, aside from Tom Tiffany

Most members of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation did not respond WPR when asked to comment on the president’s idea.

U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, R-Minocqua, a potential candidate for governor, was the exception. In a written statement, Tiffany said “states that harbor illegal aliens should not be rewarded with extra congressional seats or federal funding.”

“The Census was never intended to inflate representation for those who break our laws,” Tiffany said. “To protect the integrity of our elections, it must count only U.S. citizens because anything else dilutes the voice of American voters.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25013537846391-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 04:56:44.766254

The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is a massive victory for the Trump administration, which has lambasted U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for overstepping his authority when he initiated criminal contempt proceedings in April.

The D.C. Circuit had issued a temporary pause of Boasberg's decision while it took more time to consider the issue. In an unsigned opinion issued Friday, Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both appointed by President Trump in his first term, granted a request from the Justice Department to toss out Boasberg's contempt order. Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee, dissented.

The Alien Enemies Act case

The dispute over Boasberg's contempt order stems from immigration officials' efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act, which President Trump invoked in March to swiftly remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

In response to a fast-moving legal challenge brought by a group of migrants in Washington, D.C., over the removals, Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and issued an oral order directing the Trump administration to return Venezuelan migrants subject to Mr. Trump's declaration who were on planes bound for El Salvador back to the U.S. A written order issued shortly after prevented the Trump administration from conducting any deportations of noncitizens under the Alien Enemies Act.

But Boasberg said that despite his injunctions, the Trump administration did not stop the removals, and the planes carrying the migrants deported under the Alien Enemies Act landed in El Salvador. The planes were already outside U.S. airspace when Boasberg issued his order blocking U.S. officials from ""removing"" the detainees, a fact that the appeals court noted in ruling for the administration. Most of the people were transferred to El Salvador's notorious supermax prison, the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

The administration's actions raised questions as to whether it had violated Boasberg's order, and the judge in April ruled that probable cause existed to find government officials in criminal contempt over what he was their defiance. Boasberg said the government's actions demonstrated a ""willful disregard"" for his order.

""The court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily; indeed, it has given defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory,"" Boasberg wrote in his decision. He said the Trump administration could remedy his contempt findings by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of his order, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability.

The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's contempt finding and asked the D.C. Circuit to vacate the decision, which it then agreed to do.

In a concurring opinion on Friday, Katsas wrote that the dispute over the removal of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador in March ""involves an extraordinary, ongoing confrontation between the Executive and Judicial Branches."" He noted that the proceedings do not involve the lawfulness of removals made under the Alien Enemies Act in March, and said the court may not decide at this time ""whether the government's aggressive implementation of the presidential proclamation warrants praise or criticism as a policy matter.""

Still, Katsas wrote that a decision in favor of the Trump administration is appropriate because ""the government is plainly correct about the merits of the criminal contempt, and our saying so now would prevent long disputes between the Executive and the Judiciary over difficult, contentious issues regarding the courts' power to control foreign policy or prosecutions, or to impose criminal sanctions for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.""

""In circumstances much less fraught than these, courts have reviewed interlocutory orders through mandamus to prevent extended inter-branch conflict,"" Katsas said.

He wrote that Boasberg's contempt finding ""raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses.""

In her dissent, Pillard argued that Boasberg's contempt findings were appropriate, and said the majority's decision to throw out the contempt findings was ""in error.""

""Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt,"" Pillar wrote. ""When it appears that a judicial order has been disobeyed, the court's ability to learn who was responsible is the first step to accountability.""

ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel for the plaintiffs in the Alien Enemies Act cases, said in a statement: ""We strongly disagree with today's decision regarding contempt and are considering all options going forward. Even DOJ's own lawyers have now stated publicly that they understood that they were not supposed to hand over these men to El Salvador. There was zero ambiguity in the moment.""

Since Boasberg's findings and the appeals court's stay of his order, 252 Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to CECOT were sent from El Salvador back to their home country as part of a prisoner swap involving the U.S.

Tensions between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary have escalated across Mr. Trump's second term, as judges have issued decisions blocking implementation of many aspects of the president's agenda. But the clash between Boasberg and the president has been one of the most fierce, and the judge's contempt finding marked the most direct rebuke of the administration so far.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/08/b9c26c22-9b9b-4f32-9cd5-2bda0a74a501/thumbnail/1200x630g7/b0abc961d843a2653e48b349ddac2080/gettyimages-2228106587.jpg,N,,2025-08-09 04:56:48.006789

OK, turning now to immigration. ICE is increasingly arresting people at immigration court as they show up for routine check-ins. But federal agents are also now arresting immigrants at criminal courthouses across the U.S. Some legal experts are concerned that that creates a chilling effect, where people accused of crimes and victims are afraid to show up to court. NPR's Meg Anderson has more.

MEG ANDERSON, BYLINE: Two weeks ago, Samantha French was at the Maywood Courthouse in Cook County, Illinois, when she noticed a group of men in plain clothes.

SAMANTHA FRENCH: And they looked like they were looking for someone.

ANDERSON: French is an assistant public defender in the county.

FRENCH: I saw their attention pique when they saw someone walking toward them. And one of them very aggressively went toward this man and grabbed his wrist.

ANDERSON: She took out her phone and started recording.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hey.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: That's a lawsuit.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: [inaudible].

FRENCH: The man whose wrist he grabbed onto looked terrified, like he had no idea who these folks were, why they were putting their hands on him and what was going on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Are you his attorney?

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: No.

ANDERSON: The man was in court for misdemeanor charges. French was standing nearby and kept trying to ask questions.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

FRENCH: Did they show you any documentation, any badges that they're officials, that they're allowed to put their hands on people and take them into custody?

ANDERSON: She says they never did. The officers arrested the man. His lawyer says he is now back in Mexico. NPR spoke to more than a dozen defense lawyers and prosecutors in multiple states where criminal court arrests have taken place. Some said they heard about these arrests nearly every day. Others - just a few times since Trump took office again. But they all said the fear of it happening has made people afraid to go to court.

JASON BLANK: Our criminal justice system is based on a premise of trust. Those types of situations don't do anything to support the baseline requirements for a working criminal justice system.

ANDERSON: Jason Blank is a criminal defense lawyer in Florida. He says immigrants convicted of serious crimes, like murder, have always faced the risk of being deported. Lower-level crimes didn't usually affect someone's immigration status. But now...

BLANK: It seems to me that it's a moving goalpost these days.

ANDERSON: One man he represents is a legal permanent resident, but...

BLANK: He has chosen not to be present in person at his hearings, which he otherwise would like to go to just to keep abreast of his case, because he is concerned, as a green card holder, that he could be disappeared.

ANDERSON: Other lawyers told NPR they worry their clients feel pressured to accept plea deals so they don't have to show up to court anymore. And it's not just defendants. Immigrant victims and witnesses are afraid to go to court, too, to testify against someone, for instance, or to get a protective order.

Lazaro Salazar is an immigration lawyer in Fresno County, California. He says he recently advised an undocumented woman who was the victim in a road rage incident.

LAZARO SALAZAR: The aggressor was yelling at her, claiming to call immigration.

ANDERSON: After the man was arrested, police told the woman she might have to testify in court.

SALAZAR: And she simply is deathly afraid of having to testify. She'd rather let the whole thing go and just let bygones be bygones because she wants nothing to do with the situation.

ANDERSON: That worries prosecutors, and judges, too.

JAMIE MOSSER: For my purposes, I want justice to happen.

ANDERSON: Jamie Mosser is the state's attorney in Kane County, Illinois. She says deporting someone charged with a crime can derail a case, and it can have consequences for victims, too.

MOSSER: If somebody commits a crime, I want to be able to prosecute that person in the way that we should. But I also like to see cases get resolved for victims. And if we have delayed justice, then that just negatively affects them.

ANDERSON: Officials with ICE did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump administration is fighting attempts to keep ICE agents away from court proceedings. This June, for instance, the Justice Department sued New York over a law there that restricts ICE from arresting people in or around the state's courthouses.

Last week, the appeals court sent the case back to Boardman so she could issue the ruling.
The high court still left the door open for nationwide blocks when needed to provide plaintiffs “complete relief” or when judges certify a nationwide class action.
“Today’s decision affirms that U.S.-born children have a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship, regardless of their parents’ immigration status,” she added.
The latest ruling marks the fourth time that a court has blocked Trump’s executive order nationwide following the Supreme Court’s decision.","A federal judge in Maryland blocked President Trump’s birthright citizenship restrictions nationwide late Thursday, the fourth such ruling following the Supreme Court’s decision clawing back universal injunctions.

U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman already signaled she would block the restrictions nationwide, but she did not have jurisdiction at the time because the case rested with an appeals court.

Last week, the appeals court sent the case back to Boardman so she could issue the ruling.

The new phase of litigation follows the Supreme Court’s 6-3 decision along ideological lines curtailing judges’ ability to issue universal injunctions. The high court still left the door open for nationwide blocks when needed to provide plaintiffs “complete relief” or when judges certify a nationwide class action.

Boardman insisted she was not “resurrecting” a universal injunction and Thursday’s ruling “comports with old and recent Supreme Court precedent.”

“Here, the Court finds that the only way to afford complete relief to the certified class is to enjoin enforcement of the Executive Order as to each member of the class,” the judge wrote. “That relief must include every child in the United States who is subject to the Executive Order.”

She is an appointee of former President Biden.

Signed on Trump’s first day in office, his executive order curbs birthright citizenship for children born on U.S. soil if they don’t have at least one parent with permanent legal status. Every court to directly confront its constitutionality has found it violates the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause.

Boardman oversees a challenge brought by two immigration services organizations, CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, and eight women who are either pregnant or recently gave birth. The plaintiffs have argued an injunction that applies only in some areas or to some migrants is unworkable.

“I am proud to be a class representative in this lawsuit, and I will continue to proudly represent other families like mine who are fighting for their children’s constitutional rights,” Liza, one of the mothers suing, said in a statement. Her last name has not been made public.

“Today’s decision affirms that U.S.-born children have a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship, regardless of their parents’ immigration status,” she added.

The latest ruling marks the fourth time that a court has blocked Trump’s executive order nationwide following the Supreme Court’s decision.

An appeals court panel did so last month, as did two other federal district judges in New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

“ICE is actively recruiting officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty.” In addition to police officers, ICE is also looking to recruit military veterans and retired ICE employees.
Prospective employees are being offered eye-popping incentives from what is now the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States, including a recruitment bonus of $50,000 paid out in increments in exchange for five years of service.
Law enforcement leaders in Florida, which has more agencies partnering with ICE through the 287(g) program than any other state, are especially upset.
In late May, DHS posted a list of hundreds of so-called sanctuary jurisdictions – places that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement – on its website.","Armed with tens of billions of dollars in funding, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is working fervently to expand its ranks.

But some of the Florida law enforcement agencies that closely partner with ICE aren’t happy with the way the federal agency is going about its recruitment push: sending email blasts to local law enforcement who had been trained to work with ICE – a practice one department deemed “wrong.”

At the end of July, hundreds – possibly thousands – of sheriff’s deputies and police officers working at departments that partner with ICE received an email from the agency’s deputy director, Madison Sheahan, imploring them to consider joining ICE during a “critical time for our nation.”

“Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission—qualities we need now more than ever,” said the email, a copy of which was obtained by CNN. “ICE is actively recruiting officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty.”

In addition to police officers, ICE is also looking to recruit military veterans and retired ICE employees. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Fox News on Wednesday that ICE had removed upper age limits for applicants.

Prospective employees are being offered eye-popping incentives from what is now the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States, including a recruitment bonus of $50,000 paid out in increments in exchange for five years of service.

That’s a figure that less-funded local departments cannot compete with.

“I’ve seen bonuses being offered usually in about the $10,000-$20,000 range, but certainly not 50,” said Charles Ramsey, the former head of the Philadelphia and DC Metro police departments and a CNN contributor.

The incentives come as the agency is under tremendous pressure to deliver on Trump’s mass deportation campaign. While the White House has sought to ramp up immigration arrests, they continue to lag.

The agency also briefly floated the idea of offering cash bonuses for employees who quickly deport immigrants, according to two sources familiar with the proposal – an offer that was first reported by The New York Times and swiftly withdrawn.

Law enforcement officials who spoke with CNN said they weren’t necessarily upset by the fact that ICE is attempting to recruit their officers – it’s not uncommon for different agencies to try poaching from each other, or for officers to seek opportunities at departments that offer better pay, incentives or lifestyles.

Rather, it was the way the agency went about it.

The officers who received the email were trained through the 287(g) program, which allows local law-enforcement agencies to partner with ICE to enforce federal immigration law, and were required to provide their emails to log into training sessions as part of the certification process. An official from one Florida county said they had not previously received email blasts from ICE and did not anticipate those emails being used to head hunt their employees.

Law enforcement leaders in Florida, which has more agencies partnering with ICE through the 287(g) program than any other state, are especially upset.

“We have partnered with ICE like no other state to help ICE do its job of illegal immigration enforcement,” a spokesperson for the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. “ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership.”

Orange County Sheriff John Mina said in a statement he is disappointed “that any law enforcement agency would use information from our partnership to try and poach our deputies,” but added: “I am not concerned.”

“The Orange County Sheriff’s Office is an exemplary agency with great pay, excellent benefits, and a multitude of opportunities available to deputies – and those opportunities keep them engaged and excited about new challenges throughout their careers.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, said in a statement: “ICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country and help remove gang members, child pedophiles, murderers, terrorists, and drug traffickers.”

“This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience,” said the statement, which did not address questions about criticism from law enforcement officials who described the agency’s recruitment tactics as heavy-handed.

ICE says their recruitment push is working. Noem said on Wednesday that the agency has received more than 80,000 applications since Trump signed his “big, beautiful bill” into law on July 4. ICE said on social media it has extended 1,000 tentative job offers. The agency has not said how many of those offers have been accepted.

The frustration extends to some sheriffs who are closely aligned with ICE and its mission. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, who often speaks out about crimes committed by people in the United States illegally and is a strong supporter of Trump’s immigration crackdown, said in a video statement provided by his office that ICE is “biting the hand that’s feeding you.”

A spokesperson for Judd said hundreds of Polk County deputies received the recruitment pitch from ICE. And Judd noted that those deputies were ICE-trained on Polk County’s dime.

“It’s not professional,” Judd said in the video statement. “It’s bush league work is what it is.”

Ramsey, the former Philadelphia and DC chief, said he believed sheriffs like Judd have the right to be upset.

“At the time they provided [their deputies’ emails], I imagine they didn’t believe that this sort of thing was going to happen,” he said. “Those sheriff’s offices do more than just assist ICE. They have a lot of responsibilities and a lot of duties, and of course, if you lose your personnel, your ability to perform is impacted.”

“So I would imagine that’s one of the reasons they’re upset,” he added. “It certainly would be one of the reasons I would be upset.”

This is not the first time that ICE or DHS has upset jurisdictions with which it partners.

In late May, DHS posted a list of hundreds of so-called sanctuary jurisdictions – places that don’t cooperate with federal immigration enforcement – on its website. DHS removed the list after receiving blowback from several agencies who appeared on it but said they do cooperate with federal authorities and that the list does not accurately reflect their policies.

“Since June 6, 2025, ICE and CBP have made a total of 4,163 arrests in the Los Angeles area,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement provided to The Times.

While 1,371 arrests across the L.A. region since July 8 is still a much higher figure than any recent month before June, it represents a notable drop from the 2,792 arrests during the previous month.

The new figures confirm what many immigration experts suspected: The Trump administration’s immigration agenda in L.A. has faltered since federal courts blocked federal agents from arresting people without probable cause to believe they are in the U.S. illegally.

McLaughlin said Wednesday that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem’s agenda remained the same.

“Secretary Noem unleashed ICE and CBP to arrest criminal illegal aliens including terrorists, gang members, murderers, pedophiles, and sexual predators,” McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday. “We will continue to enforce the law and remove the worst of the worst.”

Trump administration officials have long maintained they are focused on criminals. But a few days after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller announced in late May he had set a new goal of arresting 3,000 undocumented migrants across the country a day, federal agents fanned out across L.A. to snatch people off the streets and from their workplaces.

White House top border policy advisor Tom Homan suggested federal officials adopted the strategy of raiding streets and workplaces to get around “sanctuary” jurisdictions, such as Los Angeles, that bar municipal resources and personnel from being used for immigration enforcement.

“If we can’t arrest them in jail, we’ll go out to the communities,” Homan told CBS News.

But after local protesters rallied to resist and Trump deployed the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the city, the administration’s ability to ramp up deportations across L.A. was dealt a blow in the federal courts.

On July 11, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, an appointee of President Biden, issued a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agents in southern and central California from targeting people based on their race, language, vocation or location without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

That decision was upheld last Friday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. It is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

“If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote, “they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion.”

It’s hard to know whether July numbers signal a permanent change in tactics.

On Tuesday, Border Patrol agent carried out a raid at the Home Depot in Westlake, arresting 16 people.

“For those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,” acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. “The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said her office was looking into the matter but added: “From the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eba6617/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4967x2608+0+352/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5e%2F01%2F74804a2e4e3ca6fb27ac8ac50a41%2F1509441-me-0611-ice-raid-protest-gem-008.jpg,N,,2025-08-08 07:56:29.633203

Oklahoma has agreed to stop providing in-state college tuition to illegal immigrant students after the U.S. Department of Justice sued the state this week.

State Attorney General Gentner Drummond filed a joint motion with the DOJ to abolish the Oklahoma law “that unconstitutionally gives in-state tuition to illegal immigrants,” according to a Tuesday news release from the AG’s office.

“Today marks the end of a longstanding exploitation of Oklahoma taxpayers, who for many years have subsidized colleges and universities as they provide unlawful benefits to illegal immigrants in the form of in-state tuition,” Drummond stated.

“Rewarding foreign nationals who are in our country illegally with lower tuition costs that are not made available to out-of-state American citizens is not only wrong—it is discriminatory and unlawful,” he stated.

Now the state and DOJ are awaiting a decision on the case from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, according to Inside Higher Ed.

In its lawsuit, President Donald Trump’s administration contended that Oklahoma’s state law breaches the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution by granting in-state tuition benefits at colleges and universities to individuals illegally present in the U.S., while charging higher tuition rates to legal U.S. citizens from other states.

“This unequal treatment of Americans is squarely prohibited and preempted by federal law, which expressly provides that ‘an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State … for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident,’” the lawsuit reads.

This is the first time in nearly 30 years that this 1996 law has been enforced, according to The Association of Mature American Citizens.

Currently, 23 states, including Oklahoma, offer in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, according to Higher Ed Immigration Portal. And Oklahoma is not the only state Trump has targeted for this policy.

In June, a federal judge blocked a Texas law that provided in-state tuition to illegal immigrant students at public universities who met certain requirements following a DOJ lawsuit, The College Fix previously reported.

Also in June, the DOJ sued Minnesota and Kentucky for favoring illegal immigrants over American students.

Still, Hans von Spakovsky, a former DOJ attorney, and Cully Stimson, a legal expert at the Heritage Foundation, argue the Trump administration should take further action.

“While the recent lawsuits against Minnesota and Kentucky are a great start, other states are also actively violating federal law by offering in-state tuition rates to illegal aliens while not offering the same to out-of-state students,” the two Heritage Foundation experts wrote in an article published by The Daily Signal.

“The scofflaws are Arizona, California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Nebraska, New Mexico, Kansas, Illinois, Florida, Colorado, Virginia, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York,” they wrote.
