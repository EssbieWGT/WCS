SACRAMENTO – Since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and the California Department of Justice (DOJ) have acted as a first and last line of defense against an onslaught of illegal executive orders, baseless actions, and wholesale dismantling of our government and the rule of law. Today, Attorney General Bonta reported on DOJ’s progress in safeguarding California’s funding, protecting programs and services, and defending California’s values amid ongoing illegal attacks from the Trump Administration. In just over six months, Attorney General Bonta has filed 37 lawsuits, leading or co-leading 23 of them, and separately filed more than 40 amicus briefs in support of other litigation against the Trump Administration. In the 19 cases where he has sought and a district court has ruled on early relief, he’s succeeded in 17 of them, with 13 orders blocking President Trump’s illegal actions currently in effect. He’s also secured concessions and reversals outside of court, including the Department of Education’s recent decision to restore funding it had illegally frozen just days after California filed a lawsuit.

Attorney General Bonta has ensured that roughly $168 billion continued to flow to the state through a single early lawsuit challenging the President’s illegal and sweeping freeze of federal funding. He has also protected an estimated $11.1 billion in federal grant funding from successive targeted efforts by the Trump Administration to terminate, impound, or condition specific funding for education, healthcare, transportation, and more; defended constitutional rights like birthright citizenship and the right to vote; and stopped the dismantling of federal agencies like U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) and AmeriCorps, among other relief to the states. Looking ahead, Attorney General Bonta and CADOJ remain committed to holding the President and his administration accountable each and every time they break the law.

“In his first week in office, President Trump went after a full-third of California’s budget – and we went to court less than 24 hours later and stopped him in his tracks. When the Administration’s first effort to freeze all federal funding to California failed, it changed course, flooding the zone with near-constant attempts to cut off funding like a dangerous and unruly game of wack-a-mole. But this is not a game. We’re talking about people’s livelihoods, their health, their education, and in some cases, even their lives. That’s why every time the President breaks the law, my office stands ready to take him to court,” said Attorney General Rob Bonta. “For every dollar we’ve been given by the Governor and the Legislature in Special Session funding, we’ve returned more than $33,600 for the state. I’m proud of my incredible team who has been working around the clock to protect California’s people, values, and resources in the face of relentless attacks. We know that this work is just the beginning, but we are not backing down. Too much is at stake, whether it be school programs for our kids, research for our future, medical care for our sick, or infrastructure that keeps our cars driving and planes in the air. California will continue to fight at every turn to hold the President and his Administration accountable to the Constitution they swore to uphold.”

“California’s early, proactive, and defensive actions have helped California maintain its values in the face of wholesale attacks against our families and communities, while also serving as a backstop against tyrannical actions by President Trump and those who aim to ignore the rule of law,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. “As the federal government continues to attack our state, California will keep defending itself, its values, and its people.”

WHAT WE’RE SAVING

1/3 of the State’s Budget: After the Office of Management and Budget issued a directive that purported to freeze nearly $3 trillion in federal funding, Attorney General Bonta led a multistate coalition in filing a lawsuit. He secured an immediate temporary restraining order and subsequent preliminary injunction, preserving roughly $168 billion in federal funding for California, representing about one-third of the State’s budget. These are tax dollars coming back into California, which contributes to the federal budget as a net-donor state.

Transportation Funding: California receives approximately $7 billion in grant funding from U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) each year to support and maintain the roads, highways, railways, airways, and bridges that connect our communities and carry our residents to their workplaces and their homes. In June, Attorney General Bonta secured a court order blocking the DOT from imposing unlawful immigration enforcement conditions on this grant funding.

Education Funding: Attorney General Bonta protected $939 million for California schools last week when the U.S. Department of Education reversed its decision to withhold vital education funding just weeks before the school year was set to start in the face of a multistate lawsuit. This funding supports key programs for after school and summer learning, teacher preparation, and to support students learning English.

Public Health Funding: Attorney General Bonta also protected approximately $11 billion in critical public health funding nationwide, including roughly $972 million for California through litigation challenging and subsequent court orders blocking the abrupt termination of federal funding for grants that provide essential support for a wide range of urgent public health needs, including identifying, tracking, and addressing infectious diseases; ensuring access to immunizations; and modernizing critical public health infrastructure.

Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Funding: After the Trump Administration sought to withhold billions of dollars in funding approved by bipartisan majorities in Congress for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Attorney General Bonta filed a lawsuit and secured a court order restoring more than $300 million in funding previously awarded to California.

WHAT’S AT STAKE

Stopping the Dismantling of the Federal Government: From his first days in office, President Trump has made clear his desire to eliminate many federal agencies and has sought to do so by dismantling the federal government from within. Attorney General Bonta has fought to halt these efforts, securing court orders restoring AmeriCorps programs and funding; blocking the mass firing and restructuring of HHS; and reversing the dismantling of several smaller agencies including the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.

Defending Birthright Citizenship: In the Attorney General’s first case against the second Trump Administration, just one day after President Trump took office, he filed a lawsuit challenging the President’s unconstitutional executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. At stake are an estimated 24,500 children born in California each year that would be denied the citizenship they are entitled to under the U.S. Constitution. Attorney General Bonta, with a coalition of attorneys general from across the country, has won multiple court orders barring implementation of this order nationwide while litigation continues.

Safeguarding California’s Sensitive Private Data: Attorney General Bonta has filed multiple lawsuits to protect Californians’ personal and private data from misuse by the federal government. He secured a court order blocking the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing Americans’ financial data; sued the Trump Administration for illegally sharing Medicaid data with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and challenged the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s illegal demands that states turn over the sensitive and personal data of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients.

OTHER WORK

Filing Amicus Briefs: Attorney General Bonta has filed more than 40 amicus briefs, including briefs defending law firms against President Trump’s retaliatory attacks; pushing back against the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal agencies; demanding ICE end unconstitutional immigration stops in Los Angeles; and standing up for our immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities.

Sharing Guidance: Attorney General Bonta issued guidance to law enforcement, prosecutors, public institutions, school officials, and more to assist them in complying with state laws like SB 54, which limits the use of state and local resources for immigration enforcement.

Issuing Consumer Alerts: Attorney General Bonta is committed to ensuring that Californians understand their rights and protections under state law in the face of the Trump Administration’s attacks. The Attorney General has issued a number of consumer alerts helping immigrants understand their rights and the public to avoid notario fraud and other scams, watch out for fake ICE officers, and understand tenant protections.

Providing Resources: Attorney General Bonta and a multistate coalition advised businesses and nonprofits of the ongoing viability and importance of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives. A similar coalition issued separate guidance clarifying that despite the Trump Administration’s recent efforts to mislabel and undermine these critical efforts, public and private entities can still lawfully engage in environmental justice work.",https://oag.ca.gov/sites/default/files/og-link-card-24.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:08.448867
,Litigation,2025-08-05 08:02:19+00:00,Los Angeles Times,"Bonta says millions spent, but billions saved, in California's legal war with Trump","Kevin Rector, www.latimes.com, kevin-rector",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-04/bonta-outlines-legal-spending-against-trump-to-legislature-as-he-and-newsom-tout-wins,"Rob Bonta said Monday that his office has spent more than $5 million fighting the Trump administration in court over the last six months, but saved the state nearly $170 billion.
As part of that allocation, the Legislature required that Bonta provide regular reports on how the money is spent.
They also challenged Trump administration efforts to end birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and restrict voting access in California, among other things.
On Friday, Bonta’s office filed its 37th lawsuit, challenging the administration’s efforts to block gender-affirming care for transgender youths nationwide.
California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times, and knew it would need to sue the second Trump administration too.","California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said Monday that his office has spent more than $5 million fighting the Trump administration in court over the last six months, but saved the state nearly $170 billion.

“That means that for every one dollar we’ve been given by the Legislature and the governor from special session funding to do this work — and we are very grateful for that funding — we’ve returned $33,600 for the state,” Bonta said during an afternoon news conference alongside Gov. Gavin Newsom. “Just to put it in perspective, if you told a Wall Street investor they’d get a $33,000 return on every one dollar invested, they would trip over themselves to get in on that deal.”

Bonta’s calculations are based on a mountain of litigation his office has filed against the administration since President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, including 37 lawsuits — many alongside other liberal-led states — and 47 amicus briefs backing other litigants’ lawsuits against the administration.

The vast majority of the savings Bonta claimed were the result of one particular lawsuit, in which California and other states successfully challenged a Trump administration effort to freeze trillions of dollars in federal funding to the states — including what Bonta said was $168 billion for California alone.

“In his first week in office, President Trump went after a full third of California’s budget — and we went to court less than 24 hours later and stopped him in his tracks,” Bonta said.

Bonta also cited court orders his office has won protecting $7 billion in transportation funding to maintain roads, highways, bridges and other infrastructure; $939 million in education funding for after-school and summer learning and teacher preparation; $972 million in healthcare funding for identifying, tracking and addressing infectious diseases, ensuring immunizations and modernizing public health infrastructure; and $300 million for electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. However, it has previously derided California’s efforts to block Trump’s agenda in the courts. Last month, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Times that Newsom was “destroying” the state and that Trump has been trying to “step in and save Californians from Gavin’s incompetence.”

The state Legislature during a special session in February allocated Bonta’s office an extra $25 million to staff up and fight Trump in court. As part of that allocation, the Legislature required that Bonta provide regular reports on how the money is spent. Bonta and Newsom’s news conference Monday followed the first of those reports being submitted to lawmakers.

Bonta said much of the $5 million his office has spent to date was used to pay for in-house attorneys and paralegals, and that none has been spent on outside counsel. He also said that, given the pace and scope of the work to date, his office will eventually need more funding.

“We’re grateful for the $25 million and the ability to draw down that $5 million so far. We do think we will need more going into the future, and I’m hopeful that through the conversations that we have — talking about what we would use it for, our success so far, what the continuing threats are down the road — that we’ll get to a place that will work for everybody,” Bonta said.

Newsom, citing Bonta’s financially consequential wins in court already, promised he’ll get the funding.

“Let me assure you, he will not be in need of resources to do his job,” Newsom said. “This report only highlights why I feel very confident in his ability to execute and to deliver results for the people of this state.”

Bonta’s report outlined 36 lawsuits his office had brought against the Trump administration through Wednesday. Those lawsuits challenged Trump’s efforts to slash the federal workforce, cut healthcare funding and research, dismantle the Department of Education and reduce education funding. They also challenged Trump administration efforts to end birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants and restrict voting access in California, among other things.

On Friday, Bonta’s office filed its 37th lawsuit, challenging the administration’s efforts to block gender-affirming care for transgender youths nationwide.

Newsom said Bonta’s work to date shows exactly why it was necessary for him and other California leaders to call a special session and allocate the additional funds. California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times, and knew it would need to sue the second Trump administration too.

“We were mindful that past is prologue,” Newsom said, and the added resources provided to Bonta’s office “have come to bear great fruit.”

Bonta said there is no time to slow down now as the Trump administration continues to violate the law, and that his team is ready to keep fighting.

“We know that this work is just the beginning,” he said, “but we are not backing down.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/694eafc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F53%2F07%2F0d007d784dd49f0a43cb49300e8d%2F1497898-me-bonta-office-behind-the-scenes-05-ajs.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:12.792252

Harris learned she was fired for a third time during her daughter’s high school graduation. It was a gut punch, she said, on what was meant to be a happy occasion.

The former chairwoman of an obscure but critical panel that mediates federal employee discipline, Ms. Harris was among an early slate of federal employees President Trump fired without cause. She sued the administration and went through four months of employment limbo before the Supreme Court ordered that she remain fired while her case wound through the legal system.

“Right now, I’m really laser-focused on getting my case to a win, however long it takes,” Ms. Harris said in a recent interview.

As she carves a path expected to lead back to the Supreme Court, she has added a new law firm to her team of lawyers. The four-lawyer firm, called the Washington Litigation Group, is the latest to join a coterie of pro bono organizations that have emerged in recent months to challenge the Trump administration, which is already facing about 375 lawsuits, according to The Times’s latest count.

The firm plans to focus on clients with cases likely headed to the appeals process with the potential to set precedents strengthening civil service protections and reining in executive power. Two of its lawyers, James I. Pearce and Mary Dohrmann, even share Ms. Harris’s experience of being fired by Mr. Trump. Mr. Pearce and Ms. Dohrmann were fired from the Justice Department in January because of their work on Jack Smith’s special counsel team investigating Mr. Trump.

The new group aims to bring appellate expertise to the very beginning of a client’s case, an approach that its founders say will improve the odds of making a successful argument before the Supreme Court.

It’s a game plan straight out of the Big Law playbook. But when many large firms receded from this type of work to avoid drawing Mr. Trump’s wrath, it created a void.

“Our purpose is to help fill that gap,” said Peter Keisler, one of eight members on the firm’s steering committee.

“We’ve just never before seen this kind of systematic effort by a government to use all possible levers of government power against perceived opponents,” said Mr. Keisler, a founder of the conservative Federalist Society and a former assistant attorney general and acting attorney general for President George W. Bush. The firm is applying for tax-exempt status and is seeking donations from foundation and donors. It has received some initial funding to cover the salaries of the four lawyers, a spokesman said.

The left-leaning group Democracy Forward, one of the biggest nonprofits fighting the Trump administration, has also recognized the gap in appellate expertise. The group is opening its own appellate shop this week, designed to mirror those at the big law firms, and has already hired more than a dozen lawyers, said Skye Perryman, the group’s president. The group is funded by foundations and donations.

The shift in pro bono representation is subtle but potentially significant in the legal challenges against Mr. Trump’s assertions of executive power, including the ability to carry out mass and targeted firings of civil servants and the elimination of federal programs authorized by Congress.

Now is a natural time to start thinking more about appeals, said Jeffrey L. Fisher, a professor at Stanford Law School, where he is a director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic.

“Once the cases get up to the appellate level, that’s when people start to think about which one is going to have the right timing and package of arguments and facts that’s going to be well positioned” for a hearing before the Supreme Court, Mr. Fisher said.

The appeals-focused model was intriguing to Mr. Pearce, one of the firm’s four lawyers who was previously a longtime Justice Department prosecutor. Last year, Mr. Pearce presented the government’s argument in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against Mr. Trump’s claim that he was immune from charges of plotting to subvert the 2020 election. He was among more than a dozen Justice Department lawyers who worked on the two criminal investigations into Mr. Trump who were fired in January.

Mr. Pearce is disputing the firing at the Merit Systems Protection Board, the federal employee discipline panel that Ms. Harris served on before her own termination.

“I think that a lot of the fighting will be on the scope and extent of a president’s Article II powers,” Mr. Pearce said, referring to powers outlined in the Constitution. “You see this in the independent board cases. You certainly see it, I think, in my firing and in the firing of other civil servants.”

Those powers are at the heart of the case pursued by Ms. Harris, who argues that the president did not have the authority to fire a member of a congressionally mandated independent board without cause. She said her challenge, as she waits for a decision from the federal appeals court in Washington, was not simply about getting her job back.

“It’s about much bigger principles of democracy and the balance of powers,” she said.

The Supreme Court's most recent term reshaped the legal landscape on immigration, transgender rights, and free speech. But behind the decisions, procedural shifts like limits on nationwide injunctions and expanded use of the emergency docket signal a court increasingly driven by politics.

At the ACLU we believe that information is power, and that informed opinions make a more perfect union. That’s why we’ve taken a hard look inside this Supreme Court term and analyzed what the court’s cases reveal about its values, and how its direction and influence impacts our civil liberties.

To help us all better understand the civil rights and civil liberties issues at hand this Supreme Court term, our series, “Your Questions Answered,” brings your questions directly to ACLU experts for informed answers. In this installment, our legal director, Cecillia Wang, answers your most pressing questions on the Supreme Court.

Some have said the Supreme Court is conservative. Is the Supreme Court affiliated with a political party or ideology?

The Founders designed the Supreme Court to be an independent judicial body, not a political one. Justices are not elected and don’t represent political parties. They are appointed by the president, confirmed by the Senate, and hold lifetime appointments. This structure ensures that Supreme Court justices make decisions based solely on the Constitution and the law. But in practice, presidents typically nominate justices based on how their judicial opinions align with an administration’s political beliefs. The Senate confirmation process has also become increasingly partisan.

What is the emergency docket?

The emergency docket refers to cases that reach the court through a request to temporarily block a lower court’s decision from going into effect, or order relief the lower court denied, while litigation continues. It’s possible that more cases could end up on the emergency docket outside of the Supreme Court’s regular term.

The emergency docket was particularly fraught this term because of the large number of cases challenging the Trump administration’s actions. The Supreme Court sided more often with the Trump administration on emergency docket cases, allowing the government to move forward with actions the lower courts said were unlawful.

For example, the Supreme Court issued emergency orders in two of the ACLU’s cases challenging Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to rationalize the detention and deportation of Venezuelan nationals without due process. In Trump v. J.G.G., the court granted the Trump administration’s request to pause a lower court order that blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. The court ruled that the case should have been filed in the districts where our clients were detained, not in Washington, D.C. The ACLU then brought 10 new cases in district courts around the country.

The Supreme Court ruled on birthright citizenship. Did it eliminate this constitutional right?

No. The court only considered a technical — but important — question about when federal courts can block a law or policy nationwide, instead of for a particular person or group of people.

The Supreme Court ruled in June that federal judges should tailor injunctions, or blocks on a law, to reflect how the plaintiffs who brought the case are harmed. It disapproved of injunctions that block a law or policy nationwide without making that analysis. While it is clear that certain kinds of nationwide relief are still available under the court’s decision — including injunctions in nationwide “class actions” brought on behalf of groups of people — none of the existing birthright citizenship injunctions fit those molds. The Supreme Court ultimately did not answer the question of whether the existing injunctions were enough, leaving it to the lower courts to decide that.

This opened the door to the possibility that the government could partially enforce Trump’s executive order eliminating birthright citizenship, putting thousands of U.S.-born children at risk of being denied their constitutional rights based on the citizenship status of their parents. The ACLU filed a new nationwide class-action case, Barbara v. Trump, seeking a nationwide injunction — so that even if the court orders were cut back, the unconstitutional executive order would not be applied to anyone born in the United States. We won that injunction in early July.

The government continues to try to argue that the executive order is lawful in various courts nationwide, including in its appeal of our first birthright citizenship case, which is being heard by the First Circuit Court of Appeals on August 1. The nationwide injunction in Barbara helps to ensure that babies are not wrongly stripped of their citizenship while the litigation continues.

Why is it important to fight for our rights before the Supreme Court – regardless of how the court rules?

The Supreme Court is the highest court in our nation. It’s charged with ensuring equal justice under the law, as well as upholding rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The court’s decisions shape how our rights are interpreted over the course of generations, and in some cases even centuries. That's why at the ACLU we believe any case we argue before the court has a direct impact on our rights.

For example, in U.S. v Skrmetti, the court ruled against protecting gender-affirming care for minors in Tennessee. Yet this loss still elevates how discriminatory efforts are impacting the trans community and why we must keep fighting to protect LGBTQ individuals in all states, including Tennessee.

A loss can still help lay the groundwork towards shaping a future that better reflects our civil rights and liberties. For example, In 1872, the court upheld a state law barring women from becoming lawyers in Bradwell v. Illinois. The court said that the “natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfit it for many of the occupations of civil life.” A century later, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg challenged a different law that heightened scrutiny towards laws that discriminate based on gender. We’ve come a long way. At the ACLU, we recognize that the path to upholding our civil rights and civil liberties can sometimes be a long and complex one.

If the Supreme Court rules against our rights, what do we do?

The U.S. Supreme Court is not our only option to protect and expand civil liberties and civil rights. State supreme courts have the highest judicial authority in each state and make final decisions on state-based laws targeting constitutional issues. The ACLU launched the State Supreme Court Initiative to fight for the expansion of rights through state supreme courts. With lawyers in every state, the ACLU is dedicated to using state supreme courts to affect change at the state level to, ideally, influence federal or national policies.

The Supreme Court term is over, what happens now?

This term, the court served as an essential check on executive power at key moments. But in several high-profile cases, the justices issued rulings that favored the president. As a result, legal scholars and commentators have raised concerns about “the very real possibility that at least some of the justices . . . are worried about how much capital they have to expend in confrontations with President Trump.”

As the term concludes, attention now shifts to what lies ahead. The court may be in recess, but the constitutional stakes remain high. With the Trump administration continuing to press the boundaries of executive authority, fresh legal battles are all but certain. We expect the administration to continue to pursue its agenda through the emergency docket, forcing the court to act and limiting transparency into its procedures.The next term promises renewed challenges to the separation of powers, individual rights, and the rule of law.

The ACLU will be ready. Already we’ve filed challenges to expand and protect transgender rights, to end Trump’s assault on birthright citizenship and preserve free speech for all. Whether in federal courts or through public advocacy, we will stand at the front lines to defend civil rights and civil liberties from governmental overreach.",https://www.aclu-nm.org/sites/default/files/styles/metatag_og_image_1200x630/public/protest-in-front-of-scotus-s.jpg?itok=4xgE_g-e,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:20.811794

“I was being driven back to school and started talking with the cabdriver, and he said, ‘What do you do?’” the chief justice recalled at Georgetown’s law school in May. “I said, ‘I’m a history major at Harvard.’”

The cabdriver responded that he, too, had been a history major at Harvard.

The exchange was a turning point. “I decided — nothing against cabdrivers — that law school seemed like a reasonable alternative,” Chief Justice Roberts said.

The chief justice might have tried to leave history behind, but it has caught up with him. As the Supreme Court’s decisions increasingly turn on their understanding of the distant past, the number of supporting briefs from historians has exploded and their influence has grown.

Indeed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in 2023 that such filings, which lawyers call amicus briefs, are “probably today the most important kinds of briefing,” considering “the composition of the court and the direction it’s been moving in and its jurisprudence.” She was referring to originalism, which seeks to determine the meaning of the Constitution when it was adopted.

Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton, a prominent federal appeals court judge, was already marveling at the beginnings of the phenomenon in a 2009 law review article, noting that “honest-to-goodness historians, as opposed to lawyer historians,” had filed supporting briefs in major Supreme Court cases on the Second Amendment and efforts to combat terrorism.

“By my count (an admittedly rough count),” he wrote, “historians filed more amicus briefs in the last four years than they filed in the preceding seven decades combined.”

Since then, bona fide historians have filed scores of additional briefs, according to a recent study in The Journal of American Constitutional History. And those filings have been cited by the justices at a sharply higher rate than other sorts of supporting briefs, except for those filed by lawyers for the federal government.

“With the rise of history-based arguments at the Supreme Court, we’ve had a rise in briefs filed by actual historians,” said M. Henry Ishitani, who conducted the study. A recent graduate of Yale Law School, he is teaching legal history at the University of Tulsa College of Law while finishing his history dissertation at Yale.

But the intersection of two sets of domains — of history and law, of scholarship and advocacy — can pose challenges.

Richard H. Fallon Jr., a law professor at Harvard who died last month, wrote about them in a 2012 essay prompted by a request to sign a supporting brief on a historical question.

The brief was informative, Professor Fallon wrote, and “its argumentation fell well within the bounds of what lawyers could permissibly say in a brief.”

But he said no.

“The brief’s presentation of the historical evidence bearing on the original understanding was not nuanced or balanced,” he wrote. “A purportedly scholarly book or article that asserted its claims without further qualification would attract derision as one-sided if not misleading.”

“The Oxford Handbook of Legal History” devoted a chapter to an exploration of “why historians often find amicus brief writing so vexed.”

But one of its authors, Sam Erman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the rising influence of historians was heartening.

“Courts take these briefs by historians seriously,” he said. “For all the concern about how courts do bad history and never listen to the historians, actually they do listen to the historians to some degree.”

What they are hearing is a generally liberal message.

“Self-described historians have overwhelmingly chosen to file briefs where they can support progressive causes,” Mr. Ishitani wrote. Indeed, he found, 95 percent of the historians who signed supporting briefs making history-based arguments between 1987 and 2022 took liberal positions.

A far larger number of supporting briefs drawing on history were filed by lawyers and others who did not hold themselves out to be historians. Those briefs were more ideologically mixed.

What accounts for the difference? “Undoubtedly,” Mr. Ishitani wrote, “much of the discrepancy results simply from the demographics of a discipline that reportedly votes around 80 percent Democrat and 4 percent Republican, at least at the academic level.”

Another explanation runs deeper. “Leading originalists have long waged a methodological war with constitutional historians,” Mr. Ishitani wrote. One of those originalists, Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown, has objected to what he called “the priesthood of historians” who claim to have the exclusive ability to “tell us the meaning of our fundamental law.”

That stance, Mr. Ishitani wrote, “connects with the broader populist suspicion against experts that has taken hold in recent decades on the right.”

Professor Erman said the prominent role of history at the Supreme Court has had at least one positive side effect, one that might have steered Chief Justice Roberts in a different direction in his college years.

“In an age when there are declining history majors and a terrible history job market, this is an audience of powerful people that care,” he said, referring to the justices. “It’s created jobs.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/04dc-bar1-fgzl/04dc-bar1-fgzl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:25.811392

That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country.
The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute.
Affordable housing in California zoning In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto.
“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.","East Palo Alto, like cities across California, has a law on the books that forces developers of new housing projects to foot the bill for the state’s shortage of affordable homes.

New residential projects need to set aside a share of the units they plan to build for lower-income renters and homeowners under the terms of the city’s “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Builders who refuse have to instead pay a fee, ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

An East Palo Alto homeowner filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday challenging the constitutionality of that law, likening it to “extortion” — and he had a little help from the U.S. Supreme Court.

The implications of the lawsuit range far beyond the Bay Area. A 2017 report estimated that 149 cities and counties across California have some form of inclusionary zoning rule, though the specific terms vary. That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country.

Now all that may be on the constitutional chopping block.

The case was filed in federal court in San Francisco by Wesley Yu, a husband and father between jobs, who was planning to build a home and backyard guest cottage for himself and his extended family on a neighboring parcel.

Because Yu was planning to construct two new structures, the city’s inclusionary zoning rules kicked in, requiring him to either sell or rent out one of the units at “affordable” rates or to pay a one-time fee of $54,891 to be deposited in the city’s affordable housing subsidy fund.

The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute.

That case was brought by Placerville septuagenarian, George Sheetz, who contested that the government of El Dorado County had not done enough to justify the $23,420 traffic fee it placed on his home construction project.

Sheetz’s case drew on the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which puts limits on when the government can take private property. Decades of court rulings have said that if a local government wants to base approval of a construction permit on certain conditions, those conditions have to directly relate to the costs associated with the development. A city, for example, might be able to hold off on approving a new dump until a developer pays an environmental clean up fee, but not a fee to fund local arts and recreation.

Courts have also ruled that such “exactions” on private development should be “roughly proportionate” to their cost. That is, the $23,420 that El Dorado County wanted to impose on Sheetz should match the cost of fixing the wear and tear his new home would leave on local roads.

The Supreme Court agreed that these standards ought to apply to the impact fee.

Now Yu and his legal team are asking a federal judge to apply that same rule to inclusionary zoning. For East Palo Alto’s program to pass constitutional muster, the city would have to show that the $54,891 fee or the requirement to set aside new units at a discount relates to and matches the cost that Yu’s development would impose upon the city.

The city won’t be able to show that, said David Deerson, the lead lawyer representing Yu.

“New residential development doesn’t have a negative impact on housing affordability. If anything, it has a positive impact,” he said.

A growingbodyofeconomicresearch has indeed found that local market-rate development puts downward pressure on neighborhood and city-wide rents.

Affordable housing in California zoning

In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto. Requiring private developers to toss in some added affordable housing isn’t an “exaction,” the courts have found, but a standard land-use restriction akin to any other zoning rule.

Whether a city decides it needs more schools, apartment buildings, businesses or, in the case of inclusionary zoning, affordable housing, it has broad power under the constitution to “decide, for the good of the general welfare, that we’re going to require this,” said Mike Rawson, director of litigation at the Public Interest Law Project.

The state Supreme Court ruled as such most recently in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in, a tacit approval.

“They can always change their mind,” said Rawson. “I don’t see a basis for it, though obviously that doesn’t necessarily stop them.”

The composition of the court has changed since 2015, veering sharply to the right. The Sheetz decision from last year has offered new fodder for legal challenges to inclusionary zoning.

“Sheetz really helps out here a lot” in that campaign, said Deerson. He pointed to other challenges in Denver and Teton County, Wyoming. “I would expect them to keep coming.”

Tradeoffs in housing policy

If and when the nation’s highest court takes up the issue of inclusionary zoning, it will be wading into one of the more politically charged debates in housing policy.

Evidence on the impact of these laws is mixed. Requiring private developers to build affordable units can and regularly does result in more local housing options for lower income tenants at no additional cost to taxpayers. By putting affordable and market-rate units side-by-side, they also promote economic and racial integration, supporters argue.

But inclusionary requirements can also make any given housing project less profitable, meaning that fewer units get built, leading to higher prices and rents overall. In housing markets, like California’s, that see relatively little new development, the rate at which these programs add designated affordable units to the housing stock is also quite slow.

That policy debate isn’t relevant to the legal case, which will be fought and won over abstract constitutional principles. But for libertarian-leaning groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, building industry groups and many “Yes In My Backyard” housing development advocates, an end to inclusionary zoning would be a win on both fronts.

“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.

His wife, Dr. Wafaa Alrashid, who is a U.S. citizen and chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital, told the AP she watched events unfold over the video call, ""They didn't care, they said, 'Please step out of the car,"" she recalled.

Why It Matters

The administration is pushing forward with plans to carry out widespread deportations as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

In addition to people living in the country without legal status, immigrants with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, have been detained. Newsweek has documented dozens of cases involving green card holders and applicants who were swept up in the ICE raids.

What To Know

Alrashid told the AP her husband has lived in the U.S. since 2015, and though he overstayed his initial visa, a deportation order against him was dismissed in 2020. They married in March 2025 and Othmane promptly filed for his green card, Alrashid said.

On learning her husband had been stopped, Alrashid got into her car and tracked his location on her phone, the AP reported. She reached the scene just in time to catch a glimpse of the outline of his head through the back window of a vehicle as it drove away, the agency said.

""Agents blocked his car, did not show a warrant and did not identify themselves,"" Othmane's family said in a GoFundMe set up to raise financial support.

The family said Othmane suffers from chronic pain and has an untreated tumor.

Othmane remains in federal custody at an immigration detention facility in Arizona.

""When they took him, he was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and flip-flops,"" Alrashid told a rally of fellow musicians, immigration advocates and activists outside the facility more than a week after his arrest.

""So he was freezing. Also, there are no beds, no pillows, no blankets, no soap, No toothbrushes and toothpaste. And when you're in a room with people, bathrooms open, there's no door. So it's very dehumanizing, it's undignifying, the food is not great either.""

What People Are Saying

Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek in an emailed statement on Monday: ""Rami Jilani Othmane, an illegal alien from Tunisia, was arrested by CBP on July 13. His B-2 tourist visa expired more than nine years ago. He will remain in custody at ICE's Eloy Detention Center pending his removal proceedings.

""President Trump and Secretary Noem are committed to restoring integrity to the visa program and ensuring it is not abused to allow aliens a permanent one-way ticket to remain in the U.S.

""The fact of the matter is those who are in our country illegally have a choice—they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported. The United States taxpayer is generously offering free flights and a $1,000 to illegal aliens who self-deport using the CBP Home app. If they leave now, they preserve the potential opportunity to come back the legal, right way. The choice is theirs.""

Dr. Wafaa Alrashid wrote in a post on GoFundMe: ""This is not just an immigration issue—this is a human rights crisis happening in downtown Los Angeles. My husband has been subjected to 12 days of inhumane treatment in a federal building. He is not a criminal. He is a kind, peaceful man with an open immigration petition. He should be with his family, not sleeping on a concrete floor without medical care.""

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to KABC: ""Any allegations that detainees are not receiving medical care or conditions are ""inhumane"" are FALSE. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.""

What Happens Next

A dozen Democrats in Congress sued the Trump administration last week for limiting their access to ICE detention centers. The lawmakers argue that the DHS, which oversees ICE, has inhibited lawmakers’ oversight responsibilities and violated federal law in denying members of Congress access to the facilities.

“ICE and DHS have repeatedly and illegally arrested and detained American citizens and lawful permanent residents without due process,” said Speaker Hakeem Jeffries in a statement. “These extreme tactics, like raiding churches and schools and unleashing masked ICE agents on law-abiding communities, are extreme and unacceptable.”

The cruelty we’ve seen over the past several months extends far beyond this country’s borders.

The U.S. is still on track to destroy over $13 million worth of contraceptives, paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars, and intended for women in poor nations—a move that itself will cost an additional $167,000. Trump officials have also turned down offers from multiple aid agencies to distribute the supplies at no cost. CNN reported that the contraceptives are predominantly long-lasting forms of birth control, including IUDs and injectables.

“They have to double incinerate the products because they contain high levels of hormones and they don’t want to risk leaking the byproducts out in the environment, which likely adds to the cost,” a congressional aide told CNN. “The Trump administration is quite literally burning taxpayer money.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed Justice Department prosecutors to launch a grand jury investigation of whether Obama administration officials committed federal crimes when they assessed Russia’s actions during the 2016 election, a senior Trump administration official said.

The move comes after National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard claimed at a White House news conference last month that top Obama administration officials carried out a “treasonous conspiracy” against Trump. Gabbard said she was sending criminal referrals to the Justice Department.

A former senior Justice Department official condemned the move as “a dangerous political stunt.” And a former senior national security official pointed out that multiple past reviews, including ones conducted by Republicans, found no such crimes.

“There’s no logical, rational basis for this,” said the official, who asked not to be named.

Marjorie Taylor Greene urges Trump to commute George Santos' sentence

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said on social media tonight that she had sent a letter to the Justice Department urging Trump to commute the sentence of disgraced former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y.

“I wholeheartedly believe in justice and the rule of the law, and I understand the gravity of such actions,” Greene wrote in a letter to the pardon attorney's office that she posted on X. “However, I believe a seven-year sentence for such campaign-related matters of an individual with no prior criminal record extends far beyond what is warranted.”

Asked in a Newsmax interview last week about a pardon, Trump said that Santos had ""lied like hell"" and that he was ""100% for Trump."" Trump said he had not been asked to pardon Santos.

Santos reported to prison last month to begin serving a seven-year sentence after he pleaded guilty last year to charges of wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering that prosecutors said were part of a yearslong scheme.

Santos was first elected to Congress in 2022, flipping a House seat, and was expelled in late 2023.

Nebraska Republican discusses firing of BLS chief at town hall

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., tonight discussed Trump’s firing of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics just hours after the release of a jobs report that showed a slowdown in hiring.

Flood said he did not know the situation well and that “there’s always two sides to every story,” while noting he might have made a different decision than Trump.

“If all that person did was get the data out there, if all that, and I don’t know that’s the case, but if that’s all they did, I would not have fired her,” Flood said of now-former commissioner Erika McEntarfer.

Some Republican senators reacted to McEntarfer's dismissal Friday by saying they would oppose Trump's actions if she had overseen the release of accurate figures. The White House is now searching for a replacement.

Reporting from Washington

White House officials began the week scrambling to find a permanent replacement after Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Friday, following a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and drastic downward revisions of employment for the prior two months.

Steve Bannon, a senior White House adviser in Trump’s first term who is influential with the MAGA wing of the GOP, is pushing hard for E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy rubric, has been a longtime skeptic of BLS data. On Bannon’s podcast last week, Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired shortly before Trump pulled the trigger.

In an interview with NBC News this afternoon, Antoni said he had not been contacted by anyone in the White House about the job. West Wing officials were “still running traps” on candidates for the Senate-confirmed position Monday, one White House aide said.

The White House did not return a request for comment on whether Antoni is under consideration.

Nebraska congressman asked about Epstein files at town hall

Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said he is in favor of releasing the Epstein files after being asked at a town hall about covering up their release.

“Let’s be very clear. At the next pro forma session of the Congress, you’ll find my name as a sponsor and a resolution from the House Rules Committee to release the Epstein files to protect the victims and not re-victimize them again,” Flood said.

Flood added that he supports Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., the chair of the House Oversight Committee, issuing a subpoena to Epstein’s co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before Congress.

“I support Jamie Comer, who is the House’s Oversight Committee chairman, subpoenaing Ms. Maxwell later this month to come testify in Washington. I am for the release of those records,” Flood added.

Comer last week postponed Maxwell’s deposition until at least October to let the Supreme Court decide next month whether it will review her case. The deposition had been scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison, not on Capitol Hill.

Trump administration bars trans women athletes from ‘extraordinary ability’ visas

The Department of Homeland Security will update visa policies to prevent transgender women from traveling to the United States to participate in elite women’s sporting events.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued guidance today intended to bar trans women athletes from obtaining “extraordinary ability” visas to compete in female sports, the conservative news website The Daily Wire first reported. The guidance builds on an executive order Trump issued during the early weeks of his second presidency that was intended to bar trans women from competing in female sports.

The guidance doesn’t use the word “transgender” or refer to trans women; rather, it refers to “male athletes” who seek to compete in women’s sports.

Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for USCIS, said in a statement that the agency is “closing the loophole for foreign male athletes whose only chance at winning elite sports is to change their gender identity and leverage their biological advantages against women.”

India calls Trump's threat of new tariffs 'unjustified and unreasonable'

India responded to Trump’s announcement that he intends to raise tariffs on the country for purchasing oil from Russia, calling his move “unjustified and unreasonable.”

India’s External Affairs Ministry said in a statement that the United States and Europe have unjustly targeted the country for importing Russian oil, arguing that it did so only because traditional oil supplies were diverted to Europe after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The statement went on to blast Europe and the United States for continuing to trade with Russia.

“In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” the statement read.

Epstein victims blast Justice Department over lack of transparency

and

Two victims of Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender, ripped the federal government for appearing to be more concerned with protecting the financier's wealthy friends instead of them.

The government is “asking to release these transcripts, exhibits, etc., of which the victims are not privy to while they have concluded that there is nothing more to see on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen them, but them. I am beside myself,” said one victim, who sent a letter to the federal judge weighing the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury testimony in cases involving Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.

The victim, who was not named, said, “I am not sure the highest priority here is the victims, justice for the victims or combatting child exploitation, or at least I do not feel this way.”

“If there was justice for the victims we would see some kind of accountability for the years they allowed this horrible human being, if you can call him that, to prey on underage and young girls,” the victim said.

In a separate filing, a second Epstein victim wrote in a letter to the court and the U.S. government: “I am not some pawn in your political warfare. ... Why not be completely transparent? Show us all the files with only the necessary redactions! Be done with it and allow me/us to heal.”

The person called for victims' attorneys to be allowed to review any redactions.

The victim also slammed the Justice Department's recent questioning of Maxwell, who's serving a 20-year prison sentence. The government, the victim wrote, ""did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/abuser for information.”

The Justice Department declined comment.

Trump ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of ""pertinent"" transcripts after a joint Justice Department/FBI memo released last month said that there was no evidence to charge other people and that no further information about the case would be released. The finding was met with furious backlash from Trump supporters, who had been assured there would be transparency in the case.

Texas AG Ken Paxton says Democrats who fled the state should be 'arrested, punished, and face the full force of the law'

and

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, said in a statement this afternoon that state Democratic legislators who fled the state overnight to block a GOP redistricting plan should face legal consequences.

Paxton, a U.S. Senate candidate, said the lawmakers ""fled the state in a cowardly desertion of their responsibilities as elected officials.""

""These jet-setting runaways abandoned Texas, abdicated their duties in the House, and sacrificed their constituents for a publicity stunt,” he said.

He continued: “I am prepared to do everything in my power to hold them accountable because these liberal lawmakers are not above the law. It’s imperative that they be swiftly arrested, punished, and face the full force of the law for turning their backs on the people of Texas.”

Ron DeSantis in the shadows as Florida Republicans toast Trump's team

Reporting from Orlando, Fla.

By the time Susie Wiles took the stage here at the state Republican Party’s biggest event of the year, it was clear who the star of the show was — and, equally as important, who was not.

Wiles, Trump’s longtime adviser and his current chief of staff, was at the event to receive the party’s “Statesman of the Year” award, its highest honor.

Redistricting clash escalates in Texas after Democrats scatter

+3

, , and

The Texas House is reconvening this afternoon amid a nationally watched clash over the GOP majority’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional lines, with dozens of Democrats fleeing the state to deprive Republicans of the ability to proceed with the plan.

The bulk of the 50-plus Democrats who left the state are in Illinois, where they’ve been welcomed by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker. Others are in Boston and in Albany, New York, where Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul is pushing for a change to state law to allow redistricting in response in future years. Back in Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is threatening to boot them from office or send law enforcement to force them to return to the state.

While the Texas House plans to consider the GOP plan Monday this afternoon, it cannot do so without a quorum — the presence of two-thirds of all state representatives. The rule means that 51 of the state’s 62 Democratic House members can, by remaining out of state, prevent the Republican-led House from moving forward with the legislation.

Witkoff to brief Trump on Gaza today, then travel to Russia

Special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to brief Trump later today on the findings of his trip last week to the Gaza Strip, a White House official said.

He’s then expected to travel from Washington to Moscow, according to two White House officials. His exact arrival time in Russia is unclear; one of the officials told us he will be there midweek.

Trum’s current operative deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine and avoid “secondary tariffs” and possible sanctions is Friday.

DLCC pushes for Democrats to pursue midcycle redistricting

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is calling on Democrats to use their state legislative power to pursue midcycle redistricting efforts.

The announcement, which focuses on trying to win state legislatures, marks a rise in the strategy in the broader party as Republicans in Texas push to redraw the state’s congressional map, which prompted some Democratic governors to pursue similar measures.

""As Republicans rig the maps in Texas, the DLCC is armed with our national strategy to win the larger redistricting battle,"" DLCC President Heather Williams said in a statement.

""Looking at the state-by-state math, it is crystal clear Democrats must prioritize building and securing more state legislative majorities across the map if we want to go toe-to-toe with the GOP on redistricting now and in 2030,"" she added.

Jobs data revisions are common. Here’s how the process works.

Trump fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, claiming that last week’s jobs report “was rigged” without providing any evidence.

But former Labor Statistics officials say the commissioner typically doesn’t have a role in preparing the monthly jobs report.

Trump is adding gold to Oval Office ceiling

It’s not just the Rose Garden and the Lincoln bathroom: Trump is overseeing some upgrades to the Oval Office, too, including adding gold to the ceiling, a White House official said.

Trump has steadily added more gold flourishes to the office, which is undergoing annual maintenance, the official said. Scaffolding and tape were visible through the door to the office Friday. The updates are expected to take a week or two at the most, the official added.

Separately, the Rose Garden patio project is nearly complete, and Trump using the hardscaped area for events in the coming days. The White House also recently announced plans for a massive new ballroom.

Rep. Ro Khanna leads letter pushing for U.S. to recognize Palestinian statehood

and

Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calf., is leading a letter calling on Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to recognize the Palestinian territories as an independent state.

The move comes after leaders in the United Kingdom, Canada and France said they would seek recognition of a Palestinian state. The letter has a number of co-signatories in the House, all Democrats.

“It has long been acknowledged by much of the international community and previous U.S. administrations of both major political parties that a Palestinian state recognized as a full and equal member of the community of nations is necessary to fulfill the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people and ensure the state of Israel’s survival as the democratic homeland of the Jewish people,” the letter reads.

In addition to Khanna, Reps. Greg Casar, Lloyd Dogget, Al Green and Veronica Escobar, all of Texas; Maxwell Frost, of Florida; Jared Huffman, of California; Pramila Jayapal, of Washington; James McGovern, of Massachusetts; Chellie Pingree, of Maine; Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin; Nydia Velázquez, of New York; and Bonnie Watson Coleman, of New Jersey, have signed the letter.

Despite the lawmakers' calls, there is little chance the administration will be compelled to take the step of recognizing an independent Palestinian state.

GOP congressman to introduce ban on mid-decade redistricting

and

Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., announced that he plans to introduce legislation that would prohibit mid-decade redistricting nationwide.

If passed, the bill would nix new maps adopted by states before the 2030 census, but it’s unlikely that the House GOP leadership would bring the measure to the floor for a vote.

Kiley's move comes as Texas Republicans are attempting to redraw legislative maps in a way that is expected to benefit the GOP. Some Democratic governors have threatened to try to do the same in their states if Texas Republicans are successful.

In a statement, Kiley criticized the possibility of a new redistricting push in California. He said his bill would ""also stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.""

Hakeem Jeffries calls Texas Gov. Abbott a 'cowardly, fake bully'

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., denounced Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott for threatening to remove Democratic state lawmakers from office after they fled Texas in order to block Republicans from proceeding with a new congressional redistricting map.

""The Texas governor is a cowardly, fake bully. He was ordered by Donald Trump to convene a special session of the legislature in order to gerrymander the Texas congressional map and try to rig the midterm elections,"" Jeffries said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Ana Cabrera Reports.""

Jeffries said Democrats will respond “forcefully, aggressively and relentlessly” to the GOP effort to impose a new congressional map that could add as many as five Republican seats.

The minority leader said Republicans are trying to enact a map that would protect their hold on the majority in Congress by taking five seats currently held by Democrats, ""including several in majority-minority communities around Austin, Houston, and Dallas, breaks them apart and tries to put them into Republican hands.""

""We’re only three seats short from taking back the House,"" Jeffries said about next year's midterm elections. ""That is a historically close number. That is what has House Republicans and Donald Trump scared to death of what is going to happen in the midterm election. That’s why we’re seeing this extraordinary action in Texas.""

Asked if Democrats would respond to Abbott's threat to charge or arrest the Democratic state legislators who fled Texas yesterday, Jeffries said that would be immediately challenged in court.

In a separate interview on CNN, Jeffries also said Abbott is ""out of his mind"" and said that the Republican governor is making ""idle threats.""

The governor's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump again says he will 'substantially' raise tariff on India because it's purchasing Russian oil

Trump said in a post on Truth Social this morning that he plans to increase the tariff the U.S. imposes on Indian goods because of the country's purchase of Russian oil.

""India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,"" Trump wrote.

""They don’t care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine,"" the president said. ""Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!""

The president had already announced last week that imports from India would face a 25% tariff. He had also said at the time that there would be an additional penalty on India for its reliance on Russian oil and military equipment, though he didn't specify the amount.

Texas legislators might travel to other states, lawmaker suggests

Texas lawmakers in New York did not share many details about where they would travel next or how long some planned to stay.

Texas state Rep. Mihaela Plesa said ""not all of us"" plan to stay in New York, and noted that her colleagues were continuing to talk with other governors

""We’re continuing to bring coalitions into the fold, and educating people as to what’s happening and letting them know that the rules have changed,” she said.

Hochul then chimed in, advising the Texas lawmakers not to say where they were traveling next.

Asked if the lawmakers would travel the country, not necessarily staying in New York, Plesa said, ""This is a war. We are building a coalition.""

Alongside Texas Democrats, Hochul says 'we are at war'

Hochul made multiple references to war during her press conference alongside Texas Democratic lawmakers, rhetoric apparently intended to emphasize the urgency of her response to the redistricting fight in Texas.

""Here in New York, we will not stand on the sidelines with the timid souls on the sidelines who don’t care, will not invest their heart and soul into this battle,"" Hochul said. ""This is a war. We are at war, and that’s why the gloves are off, and I say, bring it on.""

Later, the governor said that democracy was ""under siege.""

""For centuries we’ve stood up and fought,"" she added. ""Blood has been shed. This is our moment in 2025 to stand up for all that we hold dear and not let it be destroyed by a bunch of renegades in a place called Texas.""

Texas state Rep. Mihaela Plesa also referred to ""war"" when asked about the lawmakers' travel plans.

""This is a war. We are building a coalition,"" she said without disclosing where they were heading next.

Hochul lays out timeline for redistricting in New York

Asked for details about how New York Democrats would try to change the state's congressional district map, Gov. Kathy Hochul said ""the only way that we can change the timing on redistricting is to literally amend the New York state Constitution.""

The first step would be for lawmakers to take a vote on such a measure this year or next, she said. The measure could potentially go on the ballot in 2027 and be enacted by the 2028 elections, she said.

Hochul said she was also looking at litigation strategies.

No plans for Trump to use federal agents to arrest Texas Democrats in redistricting clash, admin says

According to an administration official, there are no plans to use federal agents to arrest Texas lawmakers who have left the state to escape the jurisdiction of state troopers.

“Gov. Greg Abbott can handle his own state,” the official said. The White House has been unusually silent about the Texas redistricting drama since Trump was asked about it last month.

On July 15, Trump said he’d like to redraw lines in several states besides Texas.

“There's about four of them,” he said. “I'll let you figure that one out, but we have about four of them.”

Part of the reason for the relative silence on the issue lately is that Senate Democrats are now asking the Office of Special Counsel to investigate whether White House officials have violated the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in political activity while on duty or on federal property.

NBC News reported last month that Trump held a call with Texas House Republicans where he talked up Abbott’s redistricting plans for the state, according to a GOP source on the call.

E.U. delays U.S. tariffs for 6 months as trade deal takes shape

The European Union said this morning that it would delay its planned tariffs on U.S. goods by six months as both sides implement their framework trade agreement.

The E.U.'s countermeasures were set to go into effect Thursday. The United States' 15% tariffs on European goods, meanwhile, are set to go into effect this week as part of the governments' agreement.

Taken together, the 27-nation bloc is the United States' largest trade partner.

""This political agreement restores stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,"" the European Commission’s spokesperson for trade said. ""It secures continued access for E.U. exports to the U.S. market, preserves deeply integrated transatlantic value chains, effectively safeguards millions of jobs, and provides the basis for continued strategic cooperation between the E.U. and U.S.""

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul says she is looking to redraw legislative lines in response to Texas redistricting fight

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said this morning that she is exploring options to redraw state congressional lines ""as soon as possible"" as Texas lawmakers fled their home state in an attempt to stop GOP redistricting efforts there.

""We're already working on a legislative process, reviewing our legal strategies and will do everything in our power to stop this brazen assault,"" she said.

Hochul said the GOP push in Texas ""will have implications not just in Texas, but for our entire nation and its future."" She sat alongside Texas Democratic lawmakers, praising them for getting into ""good trouble.""

Hochul painted Texas Republicans as ""flagrantly breaking the rules"" in order to hold onto power. She accused them of trying to ""eliminate fairness in the system"" to avoid losing in future elections.

""History will judge us on how we respond to this moment,"" Hochul said, adding moments later, ""this is a war.""

""We are at war,"" she said.

American Eagle stock soars after Trump praises Sweeney ad

Shares of American Eagle jumped more than 12% this morning after Trump praised the apparel retailer's controversial ad featuring actress Sydney Sweeney.

The president called it ""the HOTTEST ad out there,"" according to a Truth Social post. ""Go get ‘em, Sidney,"" he wrote of the ""Euphoria"" and ""Anyone But You"" actress. He also took a swipe at Taylor Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in November, saying he ""can’t stand"" the billionaire superstar.

The ""Sydney Sweeney has great jeans"" ad campaign generated backlash for evoking the term ""great genes,"" which is associated with eugenics and white supremacy. American Eagle said the ad message ""is and always was about the jeans.""

Trump's post gave American Eagle's stock a reprieve from an otherwise poor stretch. It's down about 32% so far this year.

Ghislaine Maxwell quietly moved to low-security prison in Texas

Jeffrey Epstein’s convicted accomplice and former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas, a move that the family of late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre is objecting to as “preferential treatment.” It comes just days after Maxwell and her lawyer met with Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche. The Bureau of Prisons has not specified why she was moved. NBC’s Hallie Jackson reports for ""TODAY.""

Stocks set to rebound after Friday jobs turmoil

U.S. stock markets are showing some life this morning after Friday's dramatic developments knocked them down a peg.

Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Industrials all pointed to a higher open. On Friday, stocks had their worst day since the spring after Trump released a new slate of global tariffs and fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner after monthly jobs data showed far weaker growth than previously thought.

Wall Street will also hear from a big slate of major companies this week, as Disney, McDonald's, YUM! Brands and others are set to report financial results and weigh in on the state of the consumer.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP lawmakers visit Israel

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and several of his GOP colleagues are in Israel today and met with the country's defense minister, Israel Katz.

“I thanked them for their unwavering support and moral clarity in standing with Israel against its enemies, and for their vital voices in the efforts to bring all the hostages home and defeat the murderous terrorist organization Hamas,” Katz said in a post to X sharing photographs from their meeting.

Johnson had previously been scheduled to visit Israel and address the Knesset in June, but his trip was postponed after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, prompting retaliatory strikes.

New wave of Trump tariffs to take effect this week

As Trump’s tariffs are set to begin Thursday, rising prices from all the tariffs could cost the average American family $2,400 in 2025, according to a new estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.

Firebrand GOP Rep. Nancy Mace launches bid for South Carolina governor

and

Rep. Nancy Mace, who has at times broken with her own GOP leaders and often courted controversy, launched a long-expected bid for governor of South Carolina today, shaking up a crowded primary race that already includes big names in the Palmetto State.

“I didn’t come to join the club. I came to hold the line. They said stay quiet; I spoke up. They said sit down; I stood up. They said play nice; I fought back,” Mace will say in a speech in Charleston, where she made history 26 years ago as the first woman to graduate from the Citadel military college. “South Carolina is tired of politicians who smile for the cameras, lie to your face, then vanish when it’s time to lead. I’m not one of them.

Ex-football coach Derek Dooley launches GOP Senate bid in Georgia

Former college football coach and attorney Derek Dooley launched his bid this morning for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Georgia, a prime pick-up opportunity for Republicans next year.

Georgia Republicans hope to win back the seat from Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is in his first term; it’s a major target for the party to maintain or expand its slim Senate majority. Democrats have overperformed in the traditionally red state in recent elections and hold both Senate seats. Joe Biden won the state in 2020 by less than half a percentage point, while Donald Trump won by just over 2 points in 2024.

Texas Democrats decamp to Illinois to deny Republicans a quorum on redistricting

and

Reporting from Carol Stream, Illinois

A showdown over redistricting in Texas played out here yesterday as dozens of state Democrats took refuge roughly 1,000 miles away from home, saying they fled Texas to deny quorum to Republican efforts to add as many as five congressional seats to their map.

It culminated with Texas’ Republican governor threatening to expel the Democrats from the Texas state House and potentially extradite them, saying they may be “felons.”

(AP) — Federal and state officials in Florida must produce agreements showing which government agency or private contractor has legal authority to detain people or perform immigration officer roles at “Alligator Alcatraz,” the immigration detention facility in the Everglades, a federal judge said Monday.

Officials must provide by Thursday all written agreements and contracts showing who has legal custody of the hundreds of detainees at the facility that was hastily constructed more than a month ago on an isolated airstrip in South Florida's Everglades wilderness, said U.S. District Judge Rodolfo Ruiz, an appointee of President Donald Trump.

Ruiz's order was part of an ongoing civil rights lawsuit against the state and federal governments by immigration attorneys who say “Alligator Alcatraz” detainees' constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings.

The federal government and Florida had asked that any disclosures be limited to agreements between U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and three Florida agencies — the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida National Guard and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.

The detainees' attorneys had requested documents showing who was responsible for removal proceedings, as well as information on the number of employees at “Alligator Alcatraz,” but Ruiz said those requests from the detainees' lawyers were too broad.

The lawsuit is the second to challenge “Alligator Alcatraz.” Environmental groups have sued federal and state officials, asking that the project be halted because the process didn’t follow state and federal environmental laws. A hearing on that lawsuit is set for Wednesday.

Separately, the Archdiocese of Miami said it celebrated the first Mass at the detention center on Saturday following weeks of negotiations.

“I am pleased that our request to provide for the pastoral care of the detainees has been accommodated,” Archdiocese of Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski said Monday in a statement.

Citizenship by birth is more than a legal term—it's a life-defining right for children born on U.S. soil. But recent developments have left many parents deeply worried. If you're undocumented, on a temporary visa, or seeking asylum, you might wonder: will my child still be a U.S. citizen at birth?

In this article, we explain how birthright citizenship works, why it's under threat, and what courts are doing to protect it. We break down President Trump's Executive Order 14160, the wave of lawsuits it triggered, and how one class action—Barbara v. Trump—temporarily saved the day. By the end, you'll know what your rights are today and what risks may lie ahead.

Citizenship by Birth

Under the Fourteenth Amendment, anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, no matter their parents' immigration status:

""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens..."" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1

For over a century, this clause has been clear. The landmark Supreme Court decision United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) confirmed that a child born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents is still a citizen at birth. Courts have reaffirmed this ever since.

This principle, known as jus soli (right of the soil), protects children of undocumented immigrants, international students, and tourists alike. It guarantees equal treatment and a clear legal identity. However, this long-standing rule is now being challenged at the highest levels of government.

Executive Order 14160

On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14160. His administration claimed that the Fourteenth Amendment had been ""misinterpreted."" The order seeks to deny citizenship to U.S.-born babies whose parents are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.

Under this order, babies born to undocumented immigrants, temporary visa holders (like students or tourists), and asylum seekers would no longer qualify for automatic citizenship. Only children with at least one citizen or green card–holding parent would.

This change was to apply only to babies born on or after February 20, 2025. Older children wouldn't be affected. Still, the order created fear and confusion, especially since it bypassed Congress and attempted to change constitutional rights through executive action alone.

Federal Courts Step In

Almost immediately, lawsuits began flooding the courts. Plaintiffs argued that EO 14160 directly violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Judges in multiple states issued injunctions to block the policy.

In Washington v. Trump, a federal judge called the executive order ""blatantly unconstitutional."" Similarly, in CASA Inc. v. Trump, Judge Deborah Boardman blocked enforcement nationwide. Both decisions reaffirmed that executive orders cannot undo constitutional guarantees.

Despite these victories, the legal fight was far from over. The Trump administration appealed. They challenged not only the content of the rulings but also the courts' ability to issue nationwide injunctions in the first place.

The Supreme Court Changes the Rules: Trump v. CASA

On June 27, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled in Trump v. CASA. The Court said federal judges cannot issue nationwide injunctions unless a certified class of plaintiffs is involved.

This was a major shift. It meant that earlier rulings blocking the order across the U.S. were no longer valid for people who weren't officially part of the lawsuits. The justices didn't say whether the order itself was legal. Instead, they focused on how far a single judge's ruling can reach.

Still, the ruling gave hope. The Court said that class action lawsuits can still seek protection for larger groups. Plaintiffs quickly adapted, and a new legal strategy took shape.

The Case of Barbara v. Trump

Just two weeks later, the case of Barbara v. Trump changed everything. A federal judge certified a nationwide class of parents and children who would be affected by EO 14160. He issued a preliminary injunction blocking the executive order from being enforced against them.

Judge Joseph Laplante ruled that denying citizenship to U.S.-born children would cause ""irreparable harm."" Babies born here would be left without citizenship, rights, or protection—effectively stateless in their own birthplace.

Thanks to this class action, the order is currently frozen. All babies born in the U.S.—even to undocumented or non-permanent resident parents—are still receiving citizenship at birth.

What Parents Should Know

As of late July 2025, EO 14160 is not being enforced. Hospitals issue regular birth certificates. Federal agencies accept those documents as proof of citizenship. If your child is born in the U.S. today, they are a citizen.

However, this could change. The Department of Justice is appealing Judge Laplante's class-wide ruling. If higher courts reverse it, the order could take effect. That's why staying updated is essential.

At the moment, no child has lost their citizenship due to this policy. But immigrant families remain on edge. Many fear that the legal status of their newborns could shift overnight if court rulings change.

What's at Stake for Families and the Nation

If EO 14160 were to take effect, the consequences would be historic. Babies born on U.S. soil could be denied citizenship. They wouldn't qualify for Social Security numbers, passports, or basic legal protections. In extreme cases, they might even face deportation.

Beyond the personal impact, this order challenges America's identity. Birthright citizenship has been a symbol of inclusion, equality, and opportunity. Reversing it would send a message that some children—born in the exact same place as others—don't belong.

This legal battle is about more than paperwork. It's about who gets to be American from day one.

WOULD YOU LİKE TO LOOK AT TRUMP'S DEPORTATİON POLICIES?

Final Thoughts: The Future of Birthright Citizenship

Right now, the courts have paused EO 14160. But the final decision hasn't been made. The Supreme Court has not ruled on the order's constitutionality. That ruling could come in the months ahead.

Until then, birthright citizenship remains protected. But the road ahead is uncertain. The legal battle continues. And families must stay informed, alert, and ready.

What's clear is this: the meaning of being born in the United States is no longer just a matter of geography. It's a matter of law—and that law is being tested like never before.

The question of the district court’s authority to enjoin the executive never came before the court in Youngstown; the Court only considered the merits.","Two cases from its recently concluded Term bring into stark relief the Supreme Court’s disrespect for both its own history and the authority of federal district courts to interpret and hold the executive accountable to the law. In Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D. (2025) and Trump v. CASA (2025), the Court demonstrated enormous and troubling deference to the Trump administration in its efforts to unilaterally impose extreme and unprecedented immigration policies. In their dissents in these cases, Justices Sotomayor and Jackson made clear that the Court’s deference threatens to radically expand executive authority, weaken judicial independence, and curb fundamental constitutional rights to due process. In making their cases, both justices rely on Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952), a nearly 75 year-old precedent that has long helped courts define the limits of executive power.

Youngstown is a 1952 case that arose when members of the United Steelworkers of America threatened a nationwide strike against steel manufacturers that would have disrupted steel production in the United States. President Harry S. Truman attempted to intervene to avoid the strike by directing the Secretary of State to take possession and “operate or arrange for the operation” of the nation’s steel mills to keep them open with Executive Order 10340. His rationale for the intervention was national security concerns regarding the United States’ efforts in the Korean War, to which the steel industry was vital in supplying materiel for the military. Truman relied solely on Article II’s executive powers in imposing the seizure, as no federal law could justify Truman’s actions, save an expansive reading of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which empowered the president to prevent strikes that affected national security but which was enacted over Truman’s veto. Truman, therefore, refused to invoke the Act as authority for the seizure, and Congress remained neutral, neither supporting Truman’s actions nor legislating against him.

Nearly all steel manufacturers sought relief in court to enjoin Truman’s order. Judge David Pine of the D.C. District Court ruled in favor of the steel manufacturers, in response to which the steelworkers initiated the nationwide strikes. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit Court decided en banc 5-4 to stay the district court’s decision, allowing the government to retain control of the mills and preventing the strike. The Supreme Court shortly thereafter accepted the petition and continued the stay. Twenty days after arguments were heard, the Court decided in a 6-3 opinion that President Truman’s executive order exceeded his authority under Article II and was therefore unconstitutional.

In his concurring opinion in Youngstown Justice Robert H. Jackson utilized both his experience dealing with executive power (Jackson had been appointed by Truman as Chief U.S. Prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, 1945-1946) and his understanding of constitutional principles as an associate justice of the Supreme Court to conclude that “presidential powers are not fixed but fluctuate depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.” Justice Jackson outlined a metric for determining the constitutional boundaries of an executive action based on its legislative backing by Congress, ranging from a presidential act 1) with congressional authorization; 2) absent congressional approval or disapproval; and 3) in opposition to congressional will. Jackson writes that the President’s claim of authority is strongest under the first category, exists in a “zone of twilight” under the second category, and is at its weakest under the third category. Though Jackson’s was a concurring opinion, over the next decades, his analysis has become one of the most frequently cited in evaluating executive actions to determine their constitutionality.

Three quarters of a century after Youngstown, the Court is now rewriting the judiciary’s authority to review executive actions, authority that was quintessential in Youngstown. While the Supreme Court’s deference to executive authority has historically fluctuated as the nation faced various crises and conflicts, the Court’s recent obsequiousness has raised alarm bells for the liberal wing of the Court and Court observers.

In CASA, the Court proscribes lower court authority to restrain the executive branch’s actions in a decision that takes a formalist and procedural approach rather than addressing the underlying substantive issues, all the while disregarding landmark precedent. The Court’s majority opinion in CASA quashes district courts’ authority to issue universal injunctions against the federal government and opens the door for the executive order ending birthright citizenship for children born to certain categories of non-citizen parents to go into effect in all states not actively litigating against the order. As Professor Kate Shaw of Penn Carey Law writes, “its going into effect anywhere would create both practical and legal chaos [emphasis in original].”

Though brought to the Court through the emergency or “shadow” docket as an application for a partial stay, the Court scheduled oral arguments. However, the Court failed to take the opportunity to hear the argument on its merits: the Trump administration is trying to assert that children born to undocumented or lawful, temporarily present mothers in the U.S. should be denied citizenship unless the father is a citizen or green card holder. Rather than considering this substantive issue, the Court took a procedural approach in an originalist manner. The majority concluded that Congress did not intend to include universal injunctions when it authorized federal courts to issue equitable remedies under the Judiciary Act of 1789 because, as the majority asserts, universal injunctions are not “remedies ‘traditionally accorded by courts of equity’ at our country’s inception.” Through this rationale, lower courts do not have universal injunction authority against the federal government. The Court then asserts the principle of “complete relief” in this case by detailing that “prohibiting enforcement of the Executive Order against the child of an individual pregnant plaintiff will give that plaintiff complete relief: Her child will not be denied citizenship.” Essentially, if an injunction provides entitled relief to the plaintiffs in a case, a court may not issue a broader injunction to include individuals not party to the case. This is how the Court is asserting complete relief. However, this reading of “complete relief” fails to address the incomplete relief of the state plaintiffs who assert they will be harmed by the patchwork enforcement created without a universal injunction.

The larger issue, as the dissenters correctly and sharply point out, is the Court’s selective application of its own jurisprudence and complete unwillingness to engage with the actual argument on the merits. The majority’s rationale in CASA (along with its complete disregard of Youngstown) implicitly reinforced the same procedural-oriented decision-making process seen just four days earlier in DVD. In DVD—an emergency application brought by the government to stay a lower court’s injunction—the Court held in an unsigned order that the Department of Homeland Security could continue to process and issue third-country deportations without providing deportees with the chance to challenge the removal on the basis of possible inhumane treatment or other dangerous conditions. Though the majority did not provide an opinion explaining its rationale, the Court seemed focused on the procedural issues of the injunction rather than the substantive issues of individuals losing due process rights.

Justice Sotomayor’s dissent in DVD exposes this thought process, applying the due process analysis in Justice Robert H. Jackon’s concurrence in Youngstown to the present case: “The Due Process Clause represents ‘the principle that ours is a government of laws, not of men, and that we submit ourselves to rulers only if under rules.’ Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 646 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).” The present Court overlooks this precedent; Justice Sotomayor correctly asserts that doing so erodes the fundamental value of due process that Youngstown laid out and signals the Court’s concerning choice to forego one of the most invaluable precedents on due process and executive authority.

Both Justices Sotomayor and Jackson refer to Robert H. Jackson’s Youngstown concurrence to emphasize its lasting impact on the judiciary’s relationship with determining and regulating executive authority. As Justice Jackson writes in her CASA dissent:

By duty and nature, federal courts say what the law is (if there is a genuine dispute), and require those who are subject to the law to conform their behavior to what the law requires. This is the essence of the rule of law. Do not take my word for it. Venerated figures in our Nation’s history have repeatedly emphasized that “[t]he essence of our free Government is ‘leave to live by no man’s leave, underneath the law’—to be governed by those impersonal forces which we call law.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 654 (1952) (R. Jackson, J., concurring).

Youngstown, then, is a core case that should have guided the Court’s decision-making in DVD and CASA, yet the Court offered no written explanation in the former and Youngstown is wholly absent from the majority opinion in the latter.

From the way Justices Sotomayor and Jackson invoke Youngstown, it is clear they are sounding the jurisprudential alarm on the Court’s evolving interpretation of executive authority. In fact, comparing the practical and legal circumstances of CASA and Youngstown reveals the majority’s divergence from precedent. Should Youngstown have been handled and decided the way the Court did with CASA, a legal desert would have opened across the country. If the Court had not addressed the substantive issue of due process rights at the earliest stage and rather allowed the Truman administration to continue enforcing its executive order until the merits were adjudicated at some later date, irreparable injury would have occurred. Plaintiffs would have lost control of the mills and suffered significant economic injury that would not necessarily have been fully resolved once the Court answered the substantive claim. In CASA, a class of people will be denied citizenship and removed from the country before the Court answers the substantive claim. Though the Court claims the government will suffer irreparable harm, the real harm is happening to those subject to this executive order. The question of the district court’s authority to enjoin the executive never came before the court in Youngstown; the Court only considered the merits. CASA’s logic would have concerned the justices of the Vinson Court, based on that court’s consensus that it was compelled to consider the merits of Truman’s executive order.

The Court’s decision to permit the federal government to continue its course of action in DVD and CASA, while considering only procedural questions and ignoring the substantive issues, veers sharply from its own precedent in Youngstown and that case’s progeny. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson are absolutely correct to raise the alarm on the Court’s disregard for procedural due process, lower courts’ authority, and the need to curb excessive exercises of executive power. If anything, Youngstown in the historical context shows us that even in a time of active military engagement where deference to the executive may be more appropriate and necessary, the Court refused to bow to executive overstep, trusted district court decision-making, and served as a necessary check to ensure due process is preserved as the merits are thoroughly considered and debated. The current Court is failing to acknowledge this core precedent. It is failing to play its proper role in checks and balances, thereby bolstering executive power at the expense of its own authority. And most heartbreakingly, it is failing to protect the most vulnerable among us.",https://www.acslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-1345904494.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:57:50.066182

Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has promised to “flood the zone” with Ice agents in New York and other sanctuary cities.","For Orlando Gutierrez in Kansas City, the thought of cancelling his community’s summer Colombian Independence Day festival first surfaced “the week after the inauguration” in January, “when the raids started happening”. The decision was rooted in “trying to be safe”, Gutierrez said. “We’re not talking about folks that are irregular in terms of their immigration status. You only have to look a certain way and speak a certain language and then you’re in danger.”

For decades prior to 2025, the event had gone on interrupted – “in rain, in extreme heat” – and hosted thousands of Colombians and non-Colombians alike, Gutierrez said. “Our mission is to share our culture with people that don’t know it,” he added. “To not have the opportunity – that’s where it hurts the most.”

In Donald Trump’s second term as president, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has been historically expansionist: it now aims for an unprecedented 3,000 minimum arrests a day. Its agents have thrown undocumented people, residents with protected legal status, and even American citizens into a deportation system that increasingly does not respect due process.

Out of fear of being targeted indiscriminately, cultural and musical events from coast to coast – block parties and summer concerts in California; Mexican heritage celebrations in Chicago; soccer fan watch parties in Massachusetts – have been postponed or canceled altogether. Even religious gatherings are no longer perceived as safe from Ice. In San Bernardino, California, Bishop Alberto Rojas has dispensed his congregation from the obligation to attend mass out of fear of deportation raids.

Every decision to cancel is heartbreaking. In Philadelphia, Carnaval de Puebla, which was scheduled for April, made the call to cancel in February, said organizer Olga Rentería. “We believe this is not a time to celebrate,” Rentería explained, “but a time to remain united, informed, and strong.” In Los Angeles, organizers of Festival Chapín, a celebration of Guatemalan culture, have postponed the event from this August to October. “It was really hard to take that decision,” Walter Rosales, a restaurateur and one of the event’s organizers, told the Guardian. “We have a lot of attendees; more than 50,000 people every year. People have hotels, they have flights. We hire people to be there. But I think it was the best [choice.] The first thing we want is the security of the people.”

Rosales said he hopes that by waiting a few months, Festival Chapín can take place amid a different political climate, one in which Ice sticks to promises made by Trump to target primarily undocumented people with criminal records.

But mass raids are likely to get more frequent: the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, legislation forced through Congress by Republicans and signed into law by Trump on the Fourth of July, will slash social programs while funding Ice at levels comparable to the budget of the US army.

It means that even huge stars are questioning whether concerts are safe for their fans. When the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny announced a recent tour that skips the continental US altogether, social media speculation centered on the notion that the artist did not want to put his fans in Ice’s crosshairs. That theorizing was in part fueled by Bad Bunny’s own dips into the wider political conversation: he’s called Ice agents “sons of bitches” on social media and his “NUEVAYoL” video – in which the Statue of Liberty is garlanded with the Puerto Rican flag – is a lovely and grand ode to New York’s immigrants.

Of avoiding the US on his upcoming tour, the artist himself has only said that, after touring regularly in the US in recent years, more dates at this time were “unnecessary”. (A representative for Bad Bunny did not respond to a request for comment.)

Gabriel Gonzales, the bandleader of the Los Angeles Latin music ensemble La Verdad, said some of their gigs have had to be cancelled this summer. “A lot of people are very scared to go out,” he said. “It’s kind of like the pandemic all over again.”

But as La Verdad continue to perform around Los Angeles and elsewhere, Gonzales is finding new meaning in playing live amid the Trump administration’s policies.

“It’s not like a rebellion,” he said. “It’s more like a resistance. As musicians, we are there to take people away for a few moments. I see communities pulling together and I feel like everything is going to be OK.”

For Joyas Mestizas, a Seattle-based Mexican folk dance youth group, which cancelled their annual festival this year, the plan is to be “more creative” going forward. “But we’re not going anywhere,” said the group’s co-director, Luna Garcia. “If I have to teach kids out of my basement, I’ll do it. The kids are going to dance.”

For some organizers of cultural events for Latino communities, pushing through and executing their plans despite fears of raids has become its own kind of crusade.

In July, federal agents were spotted on the premises of Chicago’s National Museum of Puerto Rican Arts & Culture just days before the institution was scheduled to hold its annual Barrio Arts Festival. The museum said the agents entered the property, “refused multiple requests to present a warrant, badge, or identification”, and “informed museum staff that they were assessing entry and exit points for upcoming events that may draw undocumented attendees”.

(In a statement, homeland security said agents “staged and held a quick briefing in the Museum’s parking lot in advance of an enforcement action related to a narcotics investigation”.)

In response to the presence of the federal agents, the museum decided not to cancel the festival – but, rather, to ensure it would go forward without endangering its attendees. Veronica Ocasio, the museum’s director of education and programming, said that in the days before Barrio Arts, she and her team “met non-stop” in order to create “as tight a security plan as we could”. The museum is located inside Chicago’s Humboldt Park; in order to cover the park’s 200 acres, Ocasio and her co-organizers assembled a group of volunteer immigration advocates who created a trigger warning and stood guard on rotation for the entirety of the two-day festival. If Ice agents were spotted, the museum was ready to shut down the event, close the gates, and bunker in place – holding attendees inside until the agents left. The plan then called for Ocasio and other museum employees to stand out front with immigration attorneys, holding the fort.

Delia Ramirez, an Illinois congresswoman, was also a key part of the museum’s plan. In order to head off potential Ice raids, Ramirez as well as other elected officials were on the premises “around the clock”, she said. “State representatives, city council folks, the mayor. All to protect constituents from homeland security.”

“The president has taken away people’s healthcare so he can hire more Ice agents to terrorize communities,” added Ramirez, but that doesn’t mean “there’s no oversight or accountability. At a time where the federal government wants to harm you, we will keep each other safe”. For Ramirez, Barrio Arts Festival was “a beautiful showing of people saying to Ice, ‘not here, not now, not ever’.”

Beyond her support for local cultural events, Ramirez is attempting to push back on Ice action more broadly: she’s a co-sponsor of the No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act which would prohibit Ice from the now-common practice of carrying out their deportation actions while masked. “People are freaking the hell out,” she said. “They don’t know whether it’s an Ice agent who is going to criminalize them with no due process or it’s someone who wants to rob them. No other law enforcement agency does this.”

Ultimately, not only did the Puerto Rican event in Chicago go on without interruption, but it was “our largest, most well attended Barrio Fest in our twenty-five year history”, Ocasio said. “We stood against intimidation and we created a blueprint for festivals in the city of Chicago.” The museum has already shared the safety plan it developed on the fly with organizers of upcoming events representing the local Colombian and Mexican communities.

Ahead of New York’s Colombia Independence Day festival – held in July in Corona, a working class neighborhood in Queens – organizers were similarly concerned about the possibility of Ice raids. They took precautions by bordering off the event, marking it as private, and creating a single entrance point where they would have stopped Ice agents operating without a warrant, organizers told the Guardian. Like Chicago’s Barrio Arts Festival, they had lawyers on hand from a local legal services organization. Ultimately, like Barrio Arts, they too set a new attendance record, with around 20,000 festival goers.

Catalina Cruz, a New York state assembly member who helped plan the Colombian festival, said that all the precautions she and her fellow organizers took “doesn’t explain why so many people came out – from all over the city and beyond”. She credited attendees with a certain kind of mental fortitude: “I’m not in their minds, but I don’t think they were giving a fuck about the president.”

Of course, that fuzzy feeling of having put on a successful mass event for the Latino community in the era of all-pervading fear of Ice isn’t a panacea. As Cruz put it: “What would have really stopped [Ice] if they wanted to get in? As we have seen in the case of California” – where federal agents have forcefully and en masse raided parks and working farms – “not a goddam thing.”

Newly flush with cash thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, Ice is now actively recruiting waves of new agents – to, in their words, “defend the homeland” – by offering $50,000 signing bonuses and student loan forgiveness. Tom Homan, the Trump administration’s border czar, has promised to “flood the zone” with Ice agents in New York and other sanctuary cities.

But on that Sunday in Queens, the Colombian festival ticked along beautifully with no sight or sound of the federal government’s aggressive deportation machine. Vendors pushed street-cart ceviche and plastic pouches full of high-octane primary-color beverages: “Coctelitos, coctelitos!” Seemingly every other person wore the powerful yellow jersey of the Colombian national soccer team. Twentysomethings salsa’d next to older family members grooving in their wheelchairs.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52746d92947ee652793e4562ddff620a783f6f1e/100_0_3771_3016/master/3771.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4a5808cf3af3bd1ee7924c70ec8ec48",N,,2025-08-05 02:56:47.639910

It could make for a momentous September.

Here’s a look at what’s ahead when lawmakers return after the Labor Day holiday.

A bitter spending battle ahead

Lawmakers will use much of September to work on spending bills for the coming budget year, which begins Oct. 1. They likely will need to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks while they work on a longer-term measure that covers the full year.

It’s not unusual for leaders from both parties to blame the other party for a potential shutdown, but the rhetoric began extra early this year, signaling the threat of a stoppage is more serious than usual.

On Monday, Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries sent their Republican counterparts a sharply-worded letter calling for a meeting to discuss “the government funding deadline and the health care crisis you have visited upon the American people.”

They said it will take bipartisanship to avert a “painful, unnecessary shutdown.”

“Yet it is clear that the Trump Administration and many in your party are preparing to go it alone and continue to legislate on a solely Republican basis,” said the letter sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Republicans have taken note of the warnings and are portraying the Democrats as itching for a shutdown they hope to blame on the GOP.

“It was disturbing to hear the Democrat leader threaten to shut down the government in his July 8 Dear Colleague letter,” Thune said on Saturday. “... I really hope that Democrats will not embrace that position but will continue to work with Republicans to fund the government.”

Different approaches from the House and Senate

So far, the House has approved two of the 12 annual spending bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed three on a strongly bipartisan basis. The House is pursuing steep, non-defense spending cuts. The Senate is rejecting many of those cuts. One side will have to give. And any final bill will need some Democratic support to generate the 60 votes necessary to get a spending measure to the finish line.

Some Democratic senators are also wanting assurances from Republicans that there won’t be more efforts in the coming weeks to claw back or cancel funding already approved by Congress.

“If Republicans want to make a deal, then let’s make a deal, but only if Republicans include an agreement they won’t take back that deal a few weeks later,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Tenn., a veteran member of the House Appropriations committee, said the Democratic minority in both chambers has suffered so many legislative losses this year, “that they are stuck between a rock and their voting base.” Democrats may want to demonstrate more resistance to Trump, but they would rue a shutdown, he warned.

“The reality would be, if the government were shut down, the administration, Donald Trump, would have the ability to decide where to spend and not spend,” Fleischmann said. “Schumer knows that, Jeffries knows that. We know that. I think it would be much more productive if we start talking about a short-term (continuing resolution.)”

Republicans angry about pace of nominations

Republicans are considering changes to Senate rules to get more of Trump’s nominees confirmed.

Thune said last week that during the same point in Joe Biden’s presidency, 49 of his 121 civilian nominees had been confirmed on an expedited basis through a voice vote or a unanimous consent request. Trump has had none of his civilian nominees confirmed on an expedited basis. Democrats have insisted on roll call votes for all of them, a lengthy process than can take days.

“I think they’re desperately in need of change,” Thune said of Senate rules for considering nominees. “I think that the last six months have demonstrated that this process, nominations, is broken. And so I expect there will be some good robust conversations about that.”

Schumer said a rules change would be a “huge mistake,” especially as Senate Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass spending bills and other legislation moving forward.

The Senate held a rare weekend session as Republicans worked to get more of Trump’s nominees confirmed. Negotiations focused on advancing dozens of additional Trump nominees in exchange for some concessions on releasing some already approved spending.

At times, lawmakers spoke of progress on a potential deal. But it was clear that there would be no agreement when Trump attacked Schumer on social media Saturday evening and told Republicans to pack it up and go home.

“Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL!” Trump posted on Truth Social.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/45e824c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5190x2725+0+368/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F00%2F512f7fd3b1b3a12fb15a28b3170c%2F5826bef126614b86b9007a4feabce401,N,,2025-08-05 02:56:51.799695

And he’s mostly won.

A review of Weiser’s cases shows courts have partially or fully blocked Trump administration policies from taking effect, at least temporarily, in 14 cases, left the policies in place for now in five cases, and are still considering 14 cases.

Weiser, a Democrat running for governor in 2026, joined other state attorneys general or governors on all of the cases. The decisions face appeals and are largely preliminary.

The 33 cases Weiser has brought so far eclipse the 11 he filed against Trump during the Republican’s first presidency.

Here is where the lawsuits stand as of Aug. 1, 2025.

On July 24, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14322, titled, “Saving College Sports.” Much like the SCORE Act that the Buzz recently discussed, the EO attempts to set some guardrails around the “out-of-control, rudderless system” of college athletics. The EO maintains, “A national solution is urgently needed to prevent this situation from deteriorating beyond repair and to protect non-revenue sports, including many women’s sports, that comprise the backbone of intercollegiate athletics, drive American superiority at the Olympics and other international competitions, and catalyze hundreds of thousands of student-athletes to fuel American success in myriad ways.”

Of course, the president’s authority to unilaterally set such guardrails is limited, so the EO encourages universities, depending on the amount of athletic revenue, to ensure certain amounts of scholarship opportunities and roster spots in nonrevenue sports. The EO also states that “pay for play” agreements “should not be permitted” (emphasis added). To advance these policy positions, the EO directs certain federal agencies (including the U.S. Department of Education) to “develop a plan” using “all available and appropriate regulatory, enforcement, and litigation mechanisms.” The EO also orders the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to “determine and implement the appropriate measures with respect to clarifying the status of collegiate athletes,” which is presumably that they are students and not employees. Of course, without a quorum, the Board’s ability to address this issue is currently limited.

DOL’s PAID Program Returns. The DOL’s Wage and Hour Division is reviving its Payroll Audit Independent Determination (PAID) program, which is intended to “help employers resolve potential minimum wage and overtime violations under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as well as certain potential violations under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).” The idea is to allow employers to voluntarily correct payroll errors and make employees whole in a timely manner, all while avoiding litigation. Eligible employers must meet certain criteria—such as a lack of previous violations or current litigation—before being accepted into the program and beginning their self-audits. The PAID program was first implemented during President Trump’s first administration, but was abandoned during the Biden administration.

NLRB Acting GC Issues Guidance on Union Salts. William B. Cowen, the acting general counsel of the NLRB, has issued a memorandum to regional offices, providing guidance on how they should investigate cases involving union salts (professional union organizers who seek to obtain employment with the sole intention of organizing a workplace). While job applicants are protected under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), they may lose that protection if they are not genuinely interested in seeking to establish an employment relationship with the employer. The memo provides guidance as to how regions can determine whether a genuine interest in employment is present. Indications that an applicant is not genuinely seeking employment include, but are not limited to, mass or batch applications (or stale or incomplete applications); applications with fictitious employer names, suspicious email addresses, or offensive remarks; and the applicant’s “engage[ment] in disruptive, insulting, or antagonistic behavior during the application process.” (Emphasis in the original.)

Republican Immigration Bills Seek Jail Time for Executives; Elimination of H-1B Cap Exemption. Hoping to capitalize on the Trump administration’s immigration policy agenda, Republicans in Congress have recently introduced the following bills:

“Strengthening Accountability for Employers Hiring Individuals and Reforming Enforcement Act (SAFE HIRE) Act’’

Introduced by Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH), this bill would require executives of publicly traded companies to certify in their annual SEC filings the accuracy of their employment practices, including the number and legal work status of persons employed. Executives would also be required to report to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) known “significant deficiencies” that could adversely affect the company’s ability to ensure compliance with federal employment eligibility requirements.

Misrepresentations could lead to fines of up to $1 million, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both.

Executives who knowingly hire unlawful immigrants could be fined up to $5 million and imprisoned for twenty years, or both.

“Colleges for the American People Act” (or “CAP Act”).

Introduced by Representatives Tom Tiffany (R-WI) and Andrew Clyde (R-GA), the bill would eliminate the H-1B visa cap exemption for institutions of higher learning.

The Buzz will be monitoring the progress of these bills, though congressional action on any bill relating to immigration will be challenging in this Congress.

State Department to Require In-Person Interviews for Visa Holders. The U.S. Department of State will no longer waive in-person interviews at U.S. consulates for workers on H-1B or L-1 visas, as well as students on F-1 visas. According to a July 25, 2025, update on the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs website, “All nonimmigrant visa applicants, including applicants under the age of 14 and over the age of 79, will generally require an in-person interview.” The change pulls back a Biden-era policy that had encouraged waivers of the in-person interview requirement.

This week’s UNIDOS Convention, which is hosted at the Kansas City Convention Center, Hispanic leaders fear worries over immigration raids and deportations may grow after last month’s passage of the Budget Reconciliation Bill, also known as the “Big Beautiful Bill.”

It’s a concern for some because of provisions it carries related to immigration. Recent raids in the Kansas City metro conducted by federal officers have convention leaders calling for unity and sweeping change.

“It’s a very scary time for a lot of families,” Carmen Feliciano, UNIDOS’s vice-president, said on Monday. “Our community is living in fear. They’re being prosecuted.”

Feliciano complains that immigration raids are being conducted in a heavy-handed fashion, and children are being separated from their families. Feliciano said fears are intensifying, amid concerns ICE raids may become more common after the passage of stronger immigration policies.

“What we’re seeing is they’re targeting our civilian community. They’re targeting Latino American citizens. It’s very alarming what we’re seeing,” Feliciano said.

At least two of those raids happened last week, as immigration officers swept two metro Mexican restaurants. At least 12 people were taken from the El Toro Loco locations in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. The Department of Homeland Security said it carried out a search warrant to rescue victims of human trafficking.

At Kansas City’s Mattie Rhodes Center, John Fierro works with dozens of Latino people every day at his non-profit on Kansas City’s west side.

“We just need to continue to be positive. We need to continue to use our voice, and stand up for those who are being targeted and apprehended for not legitimate reasons, and we just need to stay together,” Fierro said.

Crispin Rea, who represents Kansas City’s 4th District as a city councilmember, said these raids have a detrimental effect on children, who often witness their loved ones being taken away.

“We can’t control how the federal government makes folks feel, but at the very least, we can control how we make them feel and the extent to which they feel welcome here. That’s the goal,” Councilmember Rea told FOX4.

Feliciano said for the current generation of Latino Americans, this period of history resembles the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/08/UNIDOS-Convention-opens-in-Kansas-City.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-05 04:56:52.976805

In June 2025, Immigration Judge ShaSha Xu in New York City reportedly told lawyers in her courtroom: “We’re not really doing names publicly.” Only the government lawyers’ names were hidden – the immigrants’ attorneys had to give their names as usual. Xu cited privacy concerns, saying, “Things lately have changed.”

When one immigration lawyer objected that the court record would be incomplete without the government attorney’s name, Xu reportedly refused to provide it. In another case, New York immigration Judge James McCarthy in July referred to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, attorney as merely “Department” throughout the hearing.

New York immigration Judge Shirley Lazare-Raphael told The Intercept that some ICE attorneys believe it is “dangerous to state their names publicly.” This follows a broader pattern of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests to hide their identities.

This secrecy violates a fundamental principle that has protected Americans for centuries: open courts. Here’s how those courts operate and why the principle governing them matters.

‘Presumption of openness’

The U.S. legal system is built on openness, with multiple layers of legal protection that guarantee public access to court proceedings.

This tradition of open courts developed as a direct rejection of secret judicial proceedings that had been used to abuse power in England. The notorious Star Chamber operated in secret from the 15th to 17th centuries, initially trying people “too powerful to be brought before ordinary common-law courts.”

But the Star Chamber eventually became a tool of oppression, using torture to obtain confessions and punishing jurors who ruled against the Crown. Parliament abolished it in 1641 after widespread abuses.

By the time American colonial courts were established, the reaction against the Star Chamber had already shaped English legal thinking toward openness. American courts adopted this principle of transparency from the beginning, rejecting the secretive proceedings that had enabled abuse.

Today, the term “star chamber” refers to any secret court proceeding that seems grossly unfair or is used to persecute individuals.

In the U.S., courts have repeatedly emphasized that “justice faces its gravest threat when courts dispense it secretly.” The First Amendment gives the public a right to observe judicial proceedings. The Supreme Court has ruled that “a presumption of openness inheres in the very nature of a criminal trial under our system of justice.”

Every federal appeals court has recognized that this constitutional right extends to civil cases too, with some exceptions such as protecting “the parties’ privacy, confidential business information, or trade secrets.” Federal court rules require that trials be “conducted in open court” and that witness testimony be “taken in open court unless otherwise provided.”

Many state constitutions also guarantee open courts – such as Oregon’s mandate that “no court shall be secret.”

While there’s no explicit law requiring attorneys to be publicly named, there’s also no policy allowing their names to be kept secret. The presumption is always toward openness.

In response to these recent developments, law professor Elissa Steglich said that she’d “never heard of someone in open court not being identified,” and that failing to identify an attorney could impair accountability “if there are unethical or professional concerns.”

Rules for anonymity

Courts sometimes allow anonymity, but only in specific circumstances.

Juries can be anonymous when there’s “substantial danger of harm or undue influence,” as legal expert Michael Crowell writes – like in high-profile organized crime cases or when defendants have tried to intimidate witnesses before. Even then, the lawyers still know the jurors’ names.

Similarly, parties to a lawsuit can sometimes use pseudonyms like “Jane Doe” when the case involves highly sensitive matters such as sexual abuse, or when there’s a real risk of physical retaliation.

But these rare exceptions require careful court review.

What’s happening with ICE attorneys is different. There’s no formal court ruling allowing it, no specific safety findings and no established legal process.

Immigration courts have fewer protections

Immigration courts operate differently from regular federal courts. They are so-called “administrative courts” that are part of the executive branch, not the judicial branch.

These courts decide claims involving an individual’s right to stay in the U.S., either when the government seeks to remove someone from the country for violating immigration law or when an individual seeks to stay in the country through the asylum process.

Immigration judges lack the lifetime job protections that regular federal judges have. As executive branch government employees, they can be hired and fired, just like other Department of Justice employees.

People in immigration court also have fewer procedural protections than criminal defendants.

They have no right to court-appointed counsel and must represent themselves unless they can afford to hire an attorney. The majority of immigrants appear without an attorney. Outcomes are better for those who can afford to hire counsel.

Immigration court records are also less accessible to the public than other federal court proceedings.

For years, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the nation’s highest immigration court, made less than 1% of its opinions publicly available. A federal court ruled that public disclosure was required; the Board of Immigration Appeals now posts its decisions online.

However, lower immigration court decisions are rarely made public.

Because immigration courts operate with less oversight than regular federal courts, public observation becomes more critical.

Open courts aren’t just about legal procedure – they’re about democracy itself. When the public can observe how justice is administered, it builds confidence that the system is fair.

Court watching protects transparency

Court watching has become an important way for citizens to ensure due process is honored, especially in immigration cases.

Observers can monitor whether proper legal procedures are being followed. They can watch for signs that attorneys are prepared, treating people respectfully and following court rules – regardless of whether those attorneys identify themselves.

Observers help track trends such as lack of legal representation, language barriers or procedural unfairness that can inform advocacy for reforms. This kind of public oversight is especially important in immigration court, where people often don’t have lawyers and may not understand their rights.

When community members bear witness to these proceedings, it helps ensure the system operates fairly and transparently.

Professional ethics and accountability

As a law professor who runs a law school’s Center for Professional Ethics, I can say that while there’s no specific law forcing ICE attorneys to identify themselves, they are still bound by rules of professional conduct that require accountability and transparency.

State bar associations have clear standards about attorney conduct in court proceedings. The American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct emphasize that lawyers are “officers of the legal system” with duties to uphold its integrity.

Immigration judges, despite being government employees rather than lifetime-tenured federal judges, are also bound by judicial conduct codes that require them to uphold public confidence in the justice system. When judges allow or encourage anonymity without formal procedures or safety findings, they risk violating these ethical obligations.

Bar associations can investigate professional conduct violations and impose sanctions ranging from reprimands to suspension or disbarment. While enforcement against federal government lawyers has historically been uncommon, sustained documentation by court observers can provide the evidence needed for formal complaints.

While government attorneys, judges and other court personnel may face real safety concerns, hiding their identities in open court is unprecedented and breaks with centuries of legal tradition that requires accountability and transparency in our justice system.

As pressure mounts to process immigration cases quickly, courts are ethically and legally bound to ensure that speed doesn’t come at the expense of fundamental fairness and transparency.

“We’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent,” said state Representative Gene Wu, who chairs the Texas House Democratic Caucus.
It’s honestly amazing that Vance was able to find anything to celebrate in the dismal report, which saw only 73,000 jobs created in July, trailing estimates by more than 30,000.
It also revised previous months’ gains downward, shaving nearly 260,000 jobs off May’s and June’s report.
Reacting to the news, Trump adviser Steve Bannon suggested appointing “a MAGA Republican that President Trump knows and trusts” to head the BLS.","White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller’s ideology is making it difficult for federal authorities to actually meet his deportation quota.

The Justice Department is trying to distance itself from Miller and his expectations for federal agents to arrest 3,000 undocumented immigrants per day. In the midst of a lawsuit over ICE’s illegal sweeps in Los Angeles, the department informed federal judges that no such official quota existed.

“DHS has confirmed that neither ICE leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities that ICE or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal immigration law,” a Justice Department attorney reported to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

DOJ attorney Yaakov Roth attributed the number to “anonymous reports in the newspapers,” but that’s not true. Miller was recorded stating the goal in May, when he told Fox News unequivocally that the administration was “looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day and President Trump is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every day.”

The discrepancy between what White House advisers are willing to say on live air versus in court could boil down to a growing “gulf” that “may be undermining the DOJ’s already strained credibility with judges,” reported Politico. Skeptical judges have pointed to the figure as grounds to question whether the Trump administration’s immigration objectives are even legal.

Yet a Justice Department spokesperson insisted to the publication that there was no divergence between the White House and the law enforcement agency regarding its immigration stats and orders.

“The entire Trump Administration is united in fully enforcing our nation’s immigration laws and the DOJ continues to play an important role in vigorously defending the President’s deportation agenda in court,” a DOJ spokesperson told Politico.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott is threatening to expel any Democratic legislators who don’t show up to the Texas Capitol by Monday afternoon—after Democrats fled the state to stop a vote on Republicans’ obviously gerrymandered congressional maps.

Fifty-one Texas Democrats left the Lone Star State over the weekend, thus denying Republicans the two-thirds quorum needed for votes in the state’s 150-member legislature. They plan to stay away for the duration of the two-week special legislation in which the House is scheduled to vote on the GOP’s new congressional maps.

“We’re walking out on a rigged system that refuses to listen to the people we represent,” said state Representative Gene Wu, who chairs the Texas House Democratic Caucus. “As of today, this corrupt special session is over.”

In a statement Sunday, Abbott fulminated against the Democrats. “This truancy ends now,” he wrote. “The derelict Democrat House members must return to Texas and be in attendance when the House reconvenes at 3:00 PM on Monday, August 4, 2025.”

Citing a 2021 opinion by Republican state Attorney General Ken Paxton—who, during this ongoing gerrymandering saga, has called Democrats “cowards” who ought to be “hunt[ed] down”—Abbott said he may treat quorum-breakers as having forfeited their offices, in which case they, purportedly, could be removed from office and “swiftly” replaced.

He also accused the Democratic lawmakers of possible felonies for receiving donations to offset daily $500 fines for their absence.

The Paxton opinion, however, does not say that lawmakers who break quorum can be removed, but rather that “this is a fact-specific question only resolvable by a court,” noted Politico’s Kyle Cheney. It also refrained from deciding on the constitutionality of breaking a quorum.

Texas Democrats replied to Abbott with a storied Texas battle cry, issuing a four-word statement: “Come and take it.”

The president’s boasts about his pharmaceutical cuts aren’t just imaginary—they’re also gibberish.

Speaking with reporters in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Sunday evening, Donald Trump suggested that one of the administrative wins that Republican lawmakers should hinge their campaigns on during midterm elections is the “tremendous drop in drug prices.”

“You know we’ve cut drug prices by 1,200, 1,300, 1,400, 1,500 percent,” Trump said. “Because we’re going favored nations, we want the same price as Europe gets, we want the same price as other country gets.”

If Trump’s boast were true, drug companies would actually be paying consumers to take prescription drugs.

“Over the years, 25-30 years ago, it started where they were charging us much more and I put an end to it with a letter that you saw last week,” Trump said.

But the president has not tangibly lowered drug costs. Instead, his office issued letters Thursday to pharmaceutical companies, plainly asking them to lower their prices while vaguely threatening to deploy “every tool in our arsenal” to combat “abusive” prices should they refuse.

Trump has previously posited that the affordable price tags on pharmaceuticals in other countries were due to American federal subsidies that he claimed were financially offsetting their prices. But that’s not reality: The U.S. pays more for drugs because it’s an outlier among high-income, developed countries, which predominantly support universal public health coverage.

Trump’s first-term rule—“Most Favored Nation”—was focused on lowering the cost of Medicare payments on certain drugs, but the plan barely made it out of the White House. The policy was blocked by federal courts shortly after it was announced in late 2020 and was then rescinded by President Joe Biden in 2021.

In May, Trump penned an executive order that set a 30-day deadline for drugmakers to negotiate lower prices. If there was no deal, the U.S. would tie its drug prices to the costs set by other countries. But despite that threat, there hasn’t been any noticeable movement in either direction.

“I don’t know how anybody could win an election if they’re on the other side of that issue,” Trump said Sunday. “So we’ll be dropping drug prices, it will start over the next two to three months.

“But not just 50 percent or 25 percent, which normally would be a lot, because the rest of the world pays much less for the identical drug, and we’re going to be paying the same thing,” Trump said, promising that Americans would pay the same price for drugs as the company’s lowest international cost.

Other things that researchers point to as potentially resolving high drug prices in the U.S. include restricting pharmaceutical monopolies within the country, reworking insurance benefits to restrict out-of-pocket, and recentralizing price negotiations through the leverage of a single-payer system (such as Australia, Germany, the U.K., or any number of other wealthy nations), according to a report by the Commonwealth Fund, a private American foundation focused on health care reform.

As Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to bolster its ranks by 10,000—courtesy of the slush fund it is provided under Trump’s budget—it’s resorted to poaching local law enforcement officers who participated in ICE’s 287(g) program, which allows local law enforcement to partner with the agency.

In recent days, ICE’s deputy director has reportedly sent out emails urging 287(g) participants to join the agency. “As someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law,” the email says, per NBC News. The offer also carries potential incentives, including a $50,000 signing bonus and up to $60,000 in student loan repayment.

Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association, told NBC the move was “inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,” adding, “We’re all on the same boat. And you just don’t treat friends or partners like this.”

Sheriff Grady Judd of Polk County, Florida, told MSNBC, “We’re a force multiplier to help ICE, and we’ve been spending a lot of time and effort. And the next thing we know, the people who we have submitted to ICE, who have been ICE-trained—on our dime, by the way—received a direct email from the administration.”

Judd reached for an idiom to convey the betrayal: “I mean, that’s biting the hand that’s feeding you.” Other Florida sheriffs also got figurative: “Quite frankly, it’s like letting the fox in the henhouse,” Brevard County’s sheriff told WFTV Channel 9. “We don’t want to burn bridges, but somebody lit the fire on the other end,” observed the sheriff of Bradford County.

A number of sheriffs are now demanding mea culpas from ICE. (Judd, for instance, told NBC that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should “get on her big girl pants and do what’s right. She needs to make sure that there’s an apology.”) Some are apparently receiving them: The sheriff’s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, reportedly received an apology from ICE’s Atlanta Field Office.

Just hours before Donald Trump announced he was firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Vice President JD Vance was celebrating some cherry-picked numbers from the latest jobs report.

In a post on X Friday, Vance shared a graph based on the most recent BLS data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, claiming that in the last four months, native-born workers had gained a whopping 1.8 million jobs while foreign-born workers had lost 1.5 million jobs. The number of foreign-born workers included both documented and undocumented workers.

“I was told 6 months ago that Americans losing jobs and the foreign-born gaining jobs was an irreversible demographic fact,” Vance wrote. “Turns out you just needed a new president and a new immigration policy.”

As per usual, Vance was a little behind the curve.

Within hours, Trump had directed his administration to fire BLS Commissioner Dr. Erika McEntarfer, a Biden-appointee. “Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can’t be manipulated for political purposes,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social, torching the very numbers Vance had been toasting him over.

The latest jobs report revised the number of new jobs created by 258,000 in just two months—a revision on par with those that Trump had railed the Biden administration over ahead of the presidential election. It’s honestly amazing that Vance was able to find anything to celebrate in the dismal report, which saw only 73,000 jobs created in July, trailing estimates by more than 30,000.

Trump on Friday proved that fears about the president manipulating official data in his favor are founded, as he fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, due to a disappointing July jobs report.

The bureau’s report, released earlier in the day, showed a marked slowdown in job growth. It also revised previous months’ gains downward, shaving nearly 260,000 jobs off May’s and June’s report. Reacting to the news, Trump adviser Steve Bannon suggested appointing “a MAGA Republican that President Trump knows and trusts” to head the BLS.

Shortly thereafter, Trump announced his plan to do just that.

“I was just informed that our Country’s ‘Jobs Numbers’ are being produced by a Biden Appointee,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday afternoon. He baselessly accused McEntarfer of having fabricated job numbers, both in July and in the lead-up to the 2024 election—when, he claims, McEntarfer attempted to help rig the election for Kamala Harris.

“I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote. “She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.” The president dubiously insisted that “the Economy is BOOMING under ‘TRUMP.’”

The move is a remarkable one, as Trump has all but confessed to a plan to ensure that official data (whose integrity has already been imperiled by his cuts to federal statistical agencies) suits MAGA’s narrative.

Steve Benen of MSNBC last month observed that some were worried Trump would cook the books by, for example, telling “the Labor Department to manipulate the data and deceive the public.” However, Benen noted, “there’s been no evidence of statistics being altered to fit a political narrative” to date.

If Trump appoints a MAGA lackey to head the BLS, he wouldn’t have to tell anyone to do anything; the new commissioner would know that the bureau’s numbers are to reflect favorably on the administration no matter what.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting will be shutting down in response to federal funding cuts, it announced on Friday.

The closure marks a victory in Donald Trump’s war against public media. The CPB’s announcement cites the federal recissions package, which clawed back $1.1 billion in previously approved funding for the organization, and its exclusion from a fiscal spending bill for the first time in over five decades.

“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” said CPB president and CEO Patricia Harrison.

The company, which helps support more than 1,500 locally managed public television and radio stations nationwide, including NPR and PBS, will begin an “orderly wind-down” of its operations, including the termination of the majority of its employees by September 30.

Organizations like NPR and PBS have been the targets of Republican ire for years over alleged liberal bias. The national organizations will survive the CPB’s announcement, since they receive most of their funding through nongovernmental sources. But small, local news stations that serve rural areas will be seriously affected by these closures.

Some stations, like KCUW in Pendleton, Oregon; KUHB in St. Paul, Alaska; and WVLS in Monterey, Virginia; rely on CPB for 90 percent of their funding, according to Axios.

“Public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country,” Harrison said in the announcement. “We are deeply grateful to our partners across the system for their resilience, leadership, and unwavering dedication to serving the American people.”

Editor’s Pick:

Ghislaine Maxwell has been moved to a minimum-security prison amid speculations that Donald Trump might pressure the Epstein co-conspirator to clear his name.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed that Maxwell had been moved to the Federal Prison Camp Bryan, a women-only, minimum-security prison in Bryan, Texas. She had previously been held at FCI Tallashassee, a low-security facility in Florida.

Just 24 hours earlier, a Trump administration official told CNN that the government had no such plans to go easy on Maxwell. “No leniency is being given or discussed. That’s just false,” the official said. “The president himself has said that clemency for Maxwell is not something he is even thinking about at this time.”

Maxwell’s sudden move arrives amid swirling rumors that the president may try to offer her a presidential pardon in exchange for helping him disperse the heightened scrutiny over his numerous mentions in the Epstein files, which the government had coincidentally decided not to release.

The family of Virginia Giuffre, the former Trump employee who claimed she was recruited by Maxwell at 16 to travel with the convicted sex offender, previously warned against giving Maxwell leniency and blasted Maxwell’s favorable treatment in a Friday statement.

It is with horror and outrage that we object to the preferential treatment convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has received. Ghislaine Maxwell is a sexual predator who physically assaulted minor children on multiple occasions, and she should never be shown any leniency. Yet, without any notification to the Maxwell victims, the government overnight has moved Maxwell to a minimum security luxury prison in Texas. This is the justice system failing victims right before our eyes. The American public should be enraged by the preferential treatment being given to a pedophile and a criminally charged child sex offender. The Trump administration should not credit a word Maxwell says, as the government itself sought charges against Maxwell for being a serial liar. This move smacks of a cover up. The victims deserve better.

Earlier this week, the president claimed that Epstein “stole” Giuffre, sparking widespread outrage and inviting even more questions about whether he had been aware of his old friend’s alleged sex trafficking.

Other high-profile inmates at the Maxwell’s new digs in the Lone Star State include fake-blood extractor Elizabeth Holmes and Jen Shah of Real Housewives of Salt Lake City infamy.",https://images.newrepublic.com/6109aa8d544cfa0a9671d264c6d6ee3cd1ff5452.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-08-05 02:56:59.258847

On the economy, a cornerstone of Trump’s campaign, multiple polls show that voters decisively disapprove of Trump’s approach, especially when it comes to trade policy.
The administration’s handling of the Jeffery Epstein issue also appears to be weighing on Trump’s numbers, even among his base.
Slightly more than one-fifth (22 percent) of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein issue, a number that would look considerably worse if not for Trump’s own base.
Yet so far, Democrats have been unable to capitalize on Trump’s negative approval ratings.","As President Trump expands the trade war with new tariffs against more than 60 countries, it would behoove his administration to pay attention to what polls and public sentiment are saying.

Indeed, with Republicans holding an extremely narrow lead in the House of Representatives, how Americans feel about the administration figures to play a critical role, as midterms tend to be referenda on the party in charge.

To that end, polls continue to reflect Trump’s divisiveness and the polarization evident in American politics today, as well as widespread discontent over tariffs.

Indeed, the RealClearPolitics polling aggregator shows Trump’s average approval rating 5 points underwater — with 46 percent approval versus 51 percent disapproval.

Trump’s approval rating represents an almost 4-point drop from the roughly 50 percent of the popular vote that he won in the 2024 election.

That said, the administration should be concerned about sentiment among independents. Just 3 in 10 (29 percent) of this critical voting bloc give Trump a positive approval rating, whereas a strong majority (62 percent) disapprove of the president thus far.

Trump’s second term polling has been surprisingly stable compared to his first. Trump’s ratings, per RealClearPolitics, have never surpassed the plus-6 points he entered office with, nor have they exceeded minus-7. The relative range-bound numbers underscore that Trump has both a firm floor on his numbers and a hard ceiling.

With that in mind, the data on how Americans feel about Trump’s handling of specific issues have been much more volatile, suggesting underlying pessimism about the president and his policies.

On the economy, a cornerstone of Trump’s campaign, multiple polls show that voters decisively disapprove of Trump’s approach, especially when it comes to trade policy.

Recent polling from Fox News reveals that a majority (55 percent) of registered voters disapprove of his economic approach, whereas 44 percent approve.

Emerson University polling confirms Fox’s findings, showing a 10-point net disapproval (51 percent to 41 percent).

Recent Morning Consult polling shows that 6 in 10 (61 percent) Americans blame Trump personally for driving up the cost of living due to tariffs. A similar share (63 percent) also believe tariffs have had a negative impact on grocery prices.

Those polls come on the heels of the passage of the “Big, Beautiful bill,” which, as we’ve previously noted in these pages, was viewed quite negatively, and just before an expanded tariff policy.

Immediately prior to Trump’s tax and spending bill, a Fox News poll found that a strong majority (59 percent) of voters opposed the bill, versus just 38 percent who supported it.

Negative sentiment towards Trump’s handling of the economy had begun to improve from April’s tariff-induced chaos, particularly as trade deals were signed and it appeared more were on the way.

However, Trump had backtracked, with a series of on-again, off-again, on-again tariffs before ultimately implementing broad tariffs covering more than 60 countries on Thursday.

It is likely that Trump expanded the trade war at exactly the wrong time.

Inflation has also begun creeping back up, with the personal consumption expenditures index rising for the second straight month to the highest level since February, just as hiring is slowing markedly, according to Friday’s jobs report.

That is bad news for a president who, in addition to the aforementioned Morning Consult data, has a net negative 22-point rating on handling inflation (37 percent approve, 59 percent disapprove) according to Economist/YouGov polling.

Even on immigration, which had been a strength for the president, Trump’s heavy-handed approach has rankled voters.

A Quinnipiac poll from mid-July shows that 55 percent of Americans disapprove of how the White House is handling immigration, while 40 percent approve.

And while Quinnipiac’s numbers are more negative than other polls, RealClearPolitics’ tracker still shows Trump with a net negative 7-point rating on immigration.

The administration’s handling of the Jeffery Epstein issue also appears to be weighing on Trump’s numbers, even among his base.

Slightly more than one-fifth (22 percent) of Americans approve of Trump’s handling of the Epstein issue, a number that would look considerably worse if not for Trump’s own base. However, even among Trump voters, less than a majority (45 percent) give the president a passing grade on Epstein, per Economist/YouGov polling.

With help from Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.), who sent the House home for recess earlier than anticipated, Trump was able to avoid congressional pressure on Epstein. But that reprieve will end in a few weeks, and the issue will likely be brought back into the spotlight.

To be sure, polling does also reveal a handful of bright spots for the administration.

The share of Americans believing the country is on the “wrong track” (54 percent) remains far below the 75 percent peak that occurred during former President Biden’s term.

Yet so far, Democrats have been unable to capitalize on Trump’s negative approval ratings.

Democrats’ lead in the generic congressional ballot (3 points) is solidly within the margin of error, while some individual polls such as one from Cygnal show just a 1-point lead, a virtual tie.

In that same vein, whereas Wall Street Journal polling shows that a slight majority (52 percent) of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, that is still far below the nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of voters who view the Democratic Party unfavorably.

Moreover, while Americans give Trump negative marks on the economy, inflation, tariffs and foreign policy, they still trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle each issue, according to the Wall Street Journal’s analysis.

As they note, “disapproval of Trump’s handling of inflation outweighs approval by 11 points, and yet the GOP is trusted more than Democrats to handle inflation by 10 points.”

That is a remarkable contrast, and underscores that, despite elevated levels of disapproval toward Trump, Democrats remain unable to provide a viable alternative.

The ultimate impact of public opinion towards Trump on the midterms remains to be seen, but thus far, the data indicates that while Trump’s grip on his base remains intact, he is losing support among swing voters and even some non-MAGA Republicans.

Whether or not he can reverse this trend ahead of midterms will be critical, but only if Democrats find a way to capitalize on growing disillusionment toward Trump and the Republicans.

Foreigners seeking to enter the United States on tourist or business visas from countries with high visa overstay rates will be expected to put down no less than $5,000, the department said in a public notice. Visitors who fail to leave the United States before their visa expires will forfeit their bond; those who comply with their visa requirements will get their money back.

The notice did not specify which countries would be subject to the program, saying only that they would be determined based on visa overstay data collected and published by the Department of Homeland Security.

The move is the Trump administration’s latest in a multifront effort to crack down on illegal immigration after President Trump made the issue the centerpiece of his 2024 campaign.

A notice in the Federal Register announcing the new rule called it “a key pillar of the Trump administration’s foreign policy to protect the United States from the clear national security threat posed by visa overstays and deficient screening and vetting.”

Citing Department of Homeland Security data from 2023, the notice said that more than 500,000 people admitted to the United States through air or sea ports of entry most likely remained in the country past the end of their authorized stay.

Visitors who are made to deposit bonds will be required to arrive and depart the United States from airports chosen to participate in the program, which the State Department said it would announce 15 days before the bonds were put in place.

The 12-month pilot program will also apply to foreign nationals from countries where “screening and vetting information is deemed deficient,” according to the notice, as well as people granted citizenship on the basis of promised investments or without a residency requirement.

Consular officers granting visas will determine the amount of the bond, according to the notice.

The program is meant to test the department’s past assumption that bond payments are “too cumbersome to be practical,” as the notice put it.

Consular officers already have the authority to impose bonds on visa applicants, the notice said, but noted that the State Department’s official Foreign Affairs Manual declared that “such bonds will rarely, if ever, be used.” It called practical considerations “untested.”

The State Department planned to test a similar program late in the first Trump administration but did not carry it out after foreign travel ground to a virtual halt because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The online notice is scheduled to be published in the print edition of the Federal Register on Tuesday, and will go into effect 15 days later, on Aug. 20.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/04/multimedia/dc-visas-qkvl/dc-visas-qkvl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 02:57:10.121844

On July 30, the Times reported that ICE officials had sent a memo to field offices stating that troops will help with “alien processing,” which the Times defined as paperwork related to a person’s detention.

“This is the first time this has ever happened that the National Guard has been used to support immigration enforcement and deportation operations within the interior of the country,” Joseph Nunn, who is counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told Truthout.

The administration has already stationed troops along the Southwest border and, in June, sent soldiers to quell protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, a likely violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.

The Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 statute, bars federal armed forces from participating in civilian law enforcement activities unless authorized by law. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller reportedly encouraged Trump to send the military to Los Angeles. Miller crafted many of Trump’s anti-immigrant policies.

“Stephen has been clear in all the meetings: More military, faster,” a Trump adviser told Axios.

In an apparently unprecedented move, the Department of Defense (DOD) has deployed personnel from the Marine Corps and Naval Reserve to assist with “case management, transportation and logistical support, and clerical support for the in- and out-processing” of immigrants at ICE jails, according to a July 25 statement on DOD’s website. The Department said that National Guard troops will take over these duties and will also perform “specific operational needs [that] may require direct interaction with individuals in ICE custody.”

Nunn says deploying troops to work in immigration jails is not a clear violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. However, if National Guard soldiers perform law enforcement duties at the direction of federal officers, then he would consider that a violation of the statute. Those duties could include physically restraining or searching a person in custody, or questioning them about their immigration status.

Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director of Detention Watch Network, called the military deployments “another marker of an authoritarian regime,” noting that the Trump administration has also announced plans to detain immigrants on military bases. In January, Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of Defense and DHS to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Guantánamo Bay to “full capacity to provide additional detention space” for immigrants.

“ICE’s partnership with the Department of Defense continues to deepen, making the agency a key collaborator in the massive expansion of the immigration detention system, which is already operating at a historic high,” Ghandehari said in a statement. “It’s clear Trump and Stephen Miller are driven by a racist compulsion and will stop at nothing to proliferate hateful ideologies, intimidate government agencies, and disregard local elected leaders with the goal of villainizing all immigrants.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-4-Marines-LA-Protest.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 04:56:58.627168

“Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history.""","White House attorneys have denied that the Department of Homeland Security gave ICE agents specific targets for immigrant arrests, despite previous statements from senior advisor Stephen Miller.

In a court filing last week, reported by The Guardian, lawyers said that although an advisor may have made the remarks, that “no such goal has been set as a matter of policy, and no such directive has been issued to or by DHS or ICE.”

Miller told Fox News in June that agents had been set a target of a “minimum” of 3,000 arrests a day, as well as reportedly advising officials to target community hubs, Home Depot parking lots and 7-Eleven convenience stores to find suspects, according to The Wall Street Journal.

A report in Axios also detailed a “tense” meeting attended by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Miller in late May, in which they told senior ICE agents to supercharge arrests in order to hit the 3,000 target.

“DHS has confirmed that neither ICE leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities that ICE or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal immigration law,” the court filing read.

“[The] allegation that the government maintains a policy mandating 3,000 arrests per day appears to originate from media reports quoting a White House advisor who described that figure as a “goal” that the Administration was ‘looking to set.’

“That quotation may have been accurate, but no such goal has been set as a matter of policy, and no such directive has been issued to or by DHS or ICE.”

The filing added that, while enforcement of federal immigration law was “top priority for DHS, ICE, and the Administration,” that all government enforcement activities were based on “individualized assessments, available resources, and evolving operational priorities – not volume metrics.”

Despite this claim, the WSJ previously reported that Miller had asked top ICE officials in June if they believed it was possible to reach one million deportations by the end of the year, citing people with knowledge of the meeting.

To achieve this, he told law enforcement to “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens,” the outlet reported.

However, such a hardline stance has been defended previously by the Trump administration, including Donald Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan.

Last month Homan said that although public safety threats were a priority, those who were in the country illegally were “not off the table,” in regards to deportation. “We’re gonna enforce immigration law,” he said.

In a statement shared with The Independent, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Under Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make American safe.

In June, Idaho State Police announced it would enter into an agreement with ICE to assist with transporting undocumented immigrants from Idaho jails to ICE detention facilities.","Immigration arrests and detentions in Idaho sharply increased in 2025, following trends across the U.S.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in Idaho increased 797% in 2025 from the same time period in 2024, according to an Idaho Capital Sun review of ICE data collected by the Deportation Data Project. The project is led by attorneys and professors from multiple states who obtain public data sets through Freedom of Information Act requests.

From Jan. 1, 2024, to June 26, 2024, there were 41 reported arrests by ICE agents in Idaho, the data shows. For that time period in 2025, there were 368 arrests.

Idaho in 2024 and part of 2025 had certified the Elmore County and Jefferson County jails as federal immigration detention centers. From Jan. 1, 2024, to June 26, 2024, there were 65 reported ICE detentions in both of those facilities. For that period in 2025, there were 416 detentions, which is a 540% increase.

The number of detentions in the first six months of 2025 was more than double the number of detentions recorded for all of 2024.

“We’ve seen an increased number of calls, typically from loved ones whose loved one has been detained,” said Chris Christensen, a Boise immigration attorney. “We have seen a lot more immigration holds … and we’ve also seen a lot more aggressive tactics used by local ICE.”

Christensen, who has worked in various areas of immigration law since 2009, said he was aware of three recent incidents where ICE agents broke the window of a vehicle to remove someone inside.

The ages of those detained in Idaho ranged from 18 to 64 years old.

The youngest people arrested in Idaho were a 6-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy, both from Peru. The two children were arrested at the same time as a 33-year-old woman on Jan. 28 in the Twin Falls area. There is no record showing the woman and children were detained.

Christensen said in a February meeting with ICE agents in Idaho, local immigration lawyers were told that the agency tries to avoid detaining minors because there is nowhere to hold them in Idaho. Many of those arrested in southern Idaho end up going to a detention facility in Las Vegas, Christensen said.

The share of those arrested who had criminal convictions declined in 2025 from the year prior.

Of the arrests made this year, 250, or nearly 68%, of all arrests, were of people with criminal convictions. There were 84 arrests of those with “pending charges,” and 34 people with “other immigration violations,” according to the data.

In 2024, 34 of the 41 arrests were of those with a criminal conviction, or 82%, and five were of those with pending charges.

ICE arrests are up across the U.S., many without prior criminal convictions

Nationwide, the share of immigrants with criminal convictions has declined overall since January, Stateline reported. From January to late-June, ICE has made nearly 112,000 arrests, and 40% of them were of convicted criminals, the outlet reported. For the same time period in 2024, 53% of the approximately 51,000 arrests were of those with criminal convictions.

Arrests in Washington state rose 35% in the first five months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the Washington State Standard reported, with 782 arrests in 2025 compared to 581 the same period last year.

Trump administration officials have stated a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day; the current average is 711 as of June, the Stateline analysis of data found.

For those who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, officials under the current administration are using a process called expedited removal, Christensen said, which means they may be deported without the opportunity to see an immigration judge.

As of July, ICE issued a new policy that required those arrested by the agency to remain in detention while challenging their removal, NPR reported. The policy was challenged in court Monday in a class action lawsuit.

Christensen said this policy reverses a longtime interpretation of the law that allowed those who were considered a low or no threat to the community and a low flight risk to bond out of detention while their case went on in court.

“Personally, I think it’s the Trump administration using detention to wear immigrants down,” Christensen said. “If you’ve never been in jail before, and you are locked up in an ICE detention facility — which don’t get me wrong, looks exactly like a jail and feels exactly like a jail — people are pretty inclined to give up hope, and maybe give up on their case and return to where they’re from.”

Idaho’s law requires cooperation with immigration authorities

Through a law passed this year and an executive order by Idaho Gov. Brad Little, the state’s regulations largely require cooperation with immigration authorities.

Idaho State Police partners with ICE to deport inmates without authorization to be in U.S.

On Feb. 18, Little issued an order requiring Idaho State Police and all state agencies to collaborate fully with federal immigration authorities. The order also directed the state’s prison and parole systems to confirm immigration status prior to releasing incarcerated individuals.

The Idaho Legislature this year also passed House Bill 83, which created new state-level immigration crimes and required cooperation among local authorities and federal agencies for enforcement.

The ACLU of Idaho challenged the law in court, arguing it superseded the federal government’s authority to enforce federal crimes, the Sun reported.

A federal judge temporarily blocked the portion of the law that would’ve created state crimes for illegal entry and illegal re-entry, but District Judge Amanda Brailsford did allow the parts of the bill requiring cooperation to go into effect.

In June, Idaho State Police announced it would enter into an agreement with ICE to assist with transporting undocumented immigrants from Idaho jails to ICE detention facilities. Under the agreement, the state police agreed to spend up to $300,000 for 100 transports, the Sun reported.

Little supported the effort by utilizing his office’s Emergency Fund to reimburse state police for personnel.

“Idaho is stepping up to help the Trump administration transport dangerous illegal alien criminals to ICE facilities instead of being released back into our communities,” Little said in a written statement June 5.

There have been no transports under this agreement as of June 30, an ISP spokesperson told the Sun.

What can be done after an ICE arrest or detention?

The options available to someone who’s been arrested by ICE are different in every case, Christensen said.

“I think (immigration law) is the most complex body of law out there,” he said.

The factors at play include a prior criminal history, community ties, the person’s “flight risk,” and others, he said. For those afraid to return to their country of origin, they could apply for asylum or protection under the international human rights treaty, the Convention Against Torture. Some may qualify for protection under the Violence Against Women Act.

Christensen said he’s also been receiving calls from people who are in the country lawfully, but who fear that may be revoked. His office has additionally seen an increased scrutiny and slower processing of green card applications.

“I think there is an assault on immigration at all levels,” Christensen said.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 07:56:41.087233

“Mendez was not an ‘innocent victim,’” an ICE spokesperson told the outlet. “He is an abuser who plays the system and is now wanted for assault on a federal officer.”

The feds were conducting a raid at a construction site in Black Forest when they were attacked.

The agents fired three shots as the migrants sped away, but authorities nabbed the passenger in the vehicle, identified as Francisco Zapata-Pacheco, a few hours later.

As of 2022, there were 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.","In a new court filing, attorneys for the Trump administration denied the existence of a daily quota for immigration arrests, despite reports and prior statements from White House officials about pursuing a goal of at least 3,000 deportations or deportation arrests per day.

In May, reports from both the Guardian and Axios revealed that during a meeting with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) leaders on 21 May, the White House adviser Stephen Miller and the Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, demanded that immigration agents seek to arrest 3,000 people per day.

Following that report, Miller appeared on Fox News in late May and stated that “under President Trump’s leadership, we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for Ice every day.”

He added that Trump “is going to keep pushing to get that number up higher each and every day”.

However, in a court filing on Friday, lawyers representing the US justice department said that the Department of Homeland Security had confirmed that “neither Ice leadership nor its field offices have been directed to meet any numerical quota or target for arrests, detentions, removals, field encounters, or any other operational activities that Ice or its components undertake in the course of enforcing federal immigration law.”

The filing is part of an ongoing lawsuit in southern California, where immigrant advocacy groups have sued the Trump administration, accusing it of conducting unconstitutional immigration sweeps in the Los Angeles area.

In mid-July a judge issued a temporary restraining order barring immigration agents from detaining individuals based on factors such as race, occupation or speaking Spanish anywhere in the central district of California, which includes Los Angeles. On Friday, an appeals court upheld that order.

Politico reported that during a hearing earlier this week in the case, the justice department lawyers were pressed on the reports regarding the alleged arrest quota, and a judge reportedly asked whether it was a “policy of the administration at this time to deport 3,000 persons per day?”.

An attorney for the justice department, Yaakov Roth, reportedly responded “Not to my knowledge, your honor” per Politico.

And in the government’s filing on Friday, the attorneys for the government said that the allegations of that the “government maintains a policy mandating 3,000 arrests per day appears to originate from media reports quoting a White House advisor who described that figure as a ‘goal’ that the Administration was ‘looking to set’”.

“That quotation may have been accurate, but no such goal has been set as a matter of policy and no such directive has been issued to or by DHS or ICE” the attorneys added.

The discrepancy was first reported by the Los Angeles Daily News and Politico.

When asked about the discrepancy, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant press secretary, said in a statement to the Guardian: “Under Secretary Noem, we are delivering on President Trump’s and the American people’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make American safe.”

“Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst and carry out the largest deportation operation of criminal aliens in American history,” McLaughlin added.

In a statement to Politico, a White House spokesperson also did not directly address the questions about the discrepancy, but said that “the Trump Administration is committed to carrying out the largest mass deportation operation in history by enforcing federal immigration law and removing the countless violent, criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden let flood into American communities.”

A justice department spokesperson told the outlet that there is no disconnect between the DoJ’s court filings and the White House’s public statements.

The spokesperson added that “the entire Trump administration is united in fully enforcing our nation’s immigration laws and the DoJ continues to play an important role in vigorously defending the president’s deportation agenda in court.”

At various points during his 2024 election campaign, Trump claimed that he would target between 15 and 20 million people who are undocumented in the US for deportation.

This is one of the many arrests happening each day inside the immigration courthouse in New York City.

Agents cover their faces with masks. They wait in the hallway before springing into action, grabbing migrants leaving routine hearings.

President Trump has enlisted officers across the government, but it can be difficult to tell which agencies they work for.

Carlos Javier Lopez Benitez, a 27-year-old from Paraguay, was one of their targets on July 16. He was in court seeking asylum.

News photographers, who outnumber federal agents some days, dashed to document the arrest.

His sister, Lilian Lopez, clung to his arms, wailing, as officers clawed her grip.

This has become the new normal in America’s immigration courts.

In New York City, especially, courthouse arrests have driven a spike in detentions of undocumented immigrants without criminal records.

Immigration authorities used to stay away from courthouses. They were aware that their presence could scare migrants from engaging with the legal system.

That changed in May when the Trump administration began arresting some immigrants showing up for mandatory court dates so that their deportations could be expedited. The arrests turned the courthouses into places to witness Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown unfold in real time every day.

Masked agents stand sentry outside the courtrooms. Migrants show up for their hearings, not knowing if they’re walking into a trap. The arrests sometimes devolve into volatile tussles in hallways also crowded with news photographers, activists and politicians.

Family members are often left reeling.

“His arrest was like the show of the day,” Porfiria Lopez, one of Mr. Lopez Benitez’s sisters, said. “The question we were left with is: How do they decide who to arrest? Is it chance or just theater?”

Mr. Lopez Benitez, who is from Paraguay, crossed the southern border in May 2023. He was briefly apprehended by border patrol agents in Arizona, placed in deportation proceedings and released into the United States as his case wound through the courts. He traveled to New York, where he reunited with his two sisters, who are U.S. citizens. He lived in Queens, worked in construction and did not have a criminal record, according to his family and his lawyers.

Like many people charged with entering the country unlawfully, Mr. Lopez Benitez showed up regularly for court dates related to his deportation proceedings, a legal process in which an immigration judge decides whether a person who entered illegally should be removed from the country. As part of that process, Mr. Lopez Benitez had applied for asylum, a type of legal protection for immigrants who fear returning to their home countries.

The distant court date is not uncommon. It is the result of a backlog in the immigration courts, where millions of cases have piled up over years, frustrating Trump officials and leaving many migrants in limbo as their asylum claims are reviewed.

But upon leaving the courtroom, he was surrounded by federal agents, arrested and taken away. He was sent to a crowded holding cell at 26 Federal Plaza for three days before the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency transferred him to a detention facility 1,600 miles away — in Houston.

Mr. Lopez Benitez’s lawyers, who filed a legal motion seeking his release, were puzzled as to why he had been arrested amid his ongoing deportation proceedings. They argued that his detention violated his due process rights, that he did not pose a danger or flight risk and that he should be released while his immigration case plays out.

In legal filings, government lawyers asserted that he was subject to mandatory detention because of his unlawful entry into the country and was not entitled to a bond hearing. They added that his lawyers had failed to show any “extraordinary circumstances” that would warrant his release.

Last week, Mr. Lopez Benitez received a reprieve: A federal judge, Dale E. Ho, ordered that he be released from ICE custody and be sent back to New York while his deportation case proceeds, leaving his abrupt detention all for naught.

On Thursday, two weeks after the detention of Mr. Lopez Benitez, ICE told the family that he would be transferred back to 26 Federal Plaza at about 6 p.m. The agency told them little else.

The building was closed when the sisters showed up, so they circled its perimeter under a drizzling rain until they found an after-hours exit where they hoped their brother would emerge.

They waited, nervously, for about an hour, holding a poster with doodles of Spider-Man, Mr. Lopez Benitez’s favorite superhero, and some greetings: Welcome. We missed you.

Now is the time to stand up - The Guardian,"Guardian staff, Kica Matos",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/03/trump-us-immigration,"But for those of us on the frontlines of the fight to protect immigrants’ rights, it signaled the further entrenchment of an authoritarian regime being created on the backs of immigrants.

He called it “beautiful”. I would call it a grave and existential threat to our already precarious democracy.

Perhaps the biggest headline to emerge from this bill is that it tears giant holes into our social safety net to ensure our nation’s wealthiest could benefit from additional tax breaks. But for those of us on the frontlines of the fight to protect immigrants’ rights, it signaled the further entrenchment of an authoritarian regime being created on the backs of immigrants. Irrespective of our immigration status or views on immigration, we should all be concerned because we will all be affected: the sheer quantity of resources set aside for immigration enforcement will turbocharge the militarization of our country.

History has taught us that social justice movements can play a significant role in protecting democracies when they are at risk from authoritarian regimes. This bill should be a wakeup call for us all to step up in defense of our democracy before it is too late. Here is what we should anticipate.

The law hands over a staggering $170bn to the Department of Homeland Security to ramp up this administration’s brutal immigration enforcement agenda. Among the direct beneficiaries of this largesse is Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Even without these resources, Ice has already been responsible for outrageous and unconstitutional acts that are hacking away at our democracy. It is Ice agents in masks who are kidnapping our neighbors, snatching them off the streets, at courthouses or their workplaces, shoving them into SUVs, and taking them to detention centers. Many have been deported without even being given the right to go before a judge.

Ice agents are using unimaginably harsh tactics. They are violently smashing car windows, ripping parents away from their kids, and targeting children at school. The audacity of their lawlessness and cruelty – often on public display – is unprecedented.

The Trump administration has shown a willingness to crack down violently on those who speak out against its immigration policies. Even public officials have been caught in this dragnet, including California senator Alex Padilla, New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver, Newark mayor Ras Baraka, and New York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander. Every one of these violent encounters has been caught on film.

With this new and massive infusion of resources now being handed over to the DHS and Ice, we will soon see many more abductions on our streets, more family separations, and more brutal crackdowns on dissenters. We are also likely to see the widespread militarization of our communities, consistent with what has already transpired in parts of California: heavily armed military officers in battle fatigues carrying out violent raids with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets; the storming of public venues such as MacArthur Park in Los Angeles for no reason other than to instill fear and intimidation; and government-sanctioned attempts to silence and intimidate public officials and activists through arrests, violence, criminal sanctions and prosecutions.

As scenes previewed by militarized Los Angeles become commonplace in cities across the country – in blue states, to make an example, and in red states eager to collude – many more Americans will perhaps come to realize the full impact of this bill and recognize that the same system that cages immigrants closes rural hospitals. The same ideology that justifies family separation does not flinch when taking away food from the hungry. A government that disappears immigrants to foreign torture prisons without a day in court cannot be trusted to uphold your rights either. The machine of state violence, once built, expands.

So, what are we to do? How do we move forward?

It is incumbent on all of us to double down and meet the moment with the urgency it demands. That means committing to doing what we can to protect the most vulnerable amongst us and hold public officials accountable. We must be loud in our opposition to the attacks on our democracy and actively exercise our freedoms to protect it. We must contact our members of Congress to demand that they uphold the rule of law and take on those actively working to undermine our system of checks and balances. We must join the protests and the growing movement of people from all walks of life who are actively fighting authoritarianism. We must do everything we can to support our immigrant friends, neighbors and community members whose lives are being torn apart by this administration.

Finally, we must also vigorously reject the paralyzing lure of fatalism – that the future will merely be an extension of our present rather than something we can build together. If our government can pour boundless resources into hurting people, there is nothing radical or unrealistic in insisting that those same resources could be used to better all of our lives.

At the National Immigration Law Center, we will continue using every tool at our disposal to fight back against Trump’s attacks on our communities. We are clear eyed about how we got here and what the stakes are. Just because this moment demands defense, it will not stop us from standing firm in the declaration that a pathway to a better world still exists.

What’s giving me hope now

What’s giving me hope now is the number of people who are joining a rapidly growing movement fighting back against this administration’s authoritarian plans. They include courageous immigrants who refuse to be silenced or dehumanized; retirees who are spending time being of service to impacted immigrants, engaging elected officials and/or attending rallies and town halls; courageous young people who refuse to accept the status quo and are putting their bodies on the line; and entire communities who are speaking out and doing everything possible to protect their neighbors.

All of us have a role in upholding justice and preserving our democracy. I’m heartened to see people from all walks of life determined to do their part and remain optimistic that this movement will get bigger and stronger over time.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c7658655f6cb35abcb42bc59a67f290b8f3cbb/901_0_5921_4737/master/5921.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=0aff57e5e6fe9ad900a141098341a756",N,,2025-08-04 01:56:31.814652

A mere four days after Boasberg raised his concerns to fellow federal judges, the Trump administration defied his order against the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.
“The Trump Administration has always complied with all court orders,” wrote Bondi in her complaint against Boasberg.
And now he has trained his sights on the independent judiciary urging punishment of judges who thwart his agenda.
“Federal judges have lifetime tenure.","Last week, Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi, who shows more fealty to President Trump than to the U.S. Constitution she swore to uphold, filed a complaint against the only federal judge who has initiated contempt proceedings against the government for defying his orders.

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg, she alleged, had undermined the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary by making “improper public comments” about Trump to a group of federal judges that included Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.

What is Boasberg alleged to have said?

No transcript has emerged, but according to Bondi’s complaint, at a March session of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Boasberg is alleged to have expressed “a belief that the Trump Administration would ‘disregard rulings of the federal courts’ and trigger ‘a constitutional crisis.’ ”

The Judicial Conference is the perfect place to air such concerns. It is the policy-making body for the federal judiciary, and twice a year about two dozen federal judges, including the Supreme Court chief justice, meet to discuss issues relevant to their work. Recently, for example, they created a task force to deal with threats of physical violence, which have heightened considerably in the Trump era. But nothing that happens in their private sessions could reasonably be construed as “public comments.”

“The Judicial Conference is not a public setting. It’s an internal governing body of the judiciary, and there is no expectation that what gets said is going to be broadcast to the world,” explained former U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Fogel, who spent seven years as director of the Federal Judicial Center in Washington, a kind of think tank for the judiciary. I reached out to Fogel because he is part of a coalition of retired federal judges — the Article III Coalition of the nonpartisan civic education group Keep Our Republic — whose goal is to defend the independence of the judiciary and promote understanding of the rule of law.

Bondi’s complaint accuses Boasberg of attempting to “transform a routine housekeeping agenda into a forum to persuade the Chief Justice and other federal judges of his preconceived belief that the Trump Administration would violate court orders.”

You know how they say that every accusation is a confession in Trump World?

A mere four days after Boasberg raised his concerns to fellow federal judges, the Trump administration defied his order against the deportation of Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.

You probably remember that one. A plane carrying the deportees was already in the air, and despite the judge’s ruling, Trump officials refused to order its return. “Oopsie,” tweeted El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele after it landed. “Too late!”

Thus began the administration’s ongoing pattern of ignoring or flouting the courts in cases brought against it. It’s not as if the signs were not there. “He who saves his Country does not violate any law,” Trump wrote on social media in February, paraphrasing Napoleon Bonaparte, the dictatorial 19th century emperor of France.

In June, Erez Reuveni, a career Department of Justice attorney who was fired when he told a Maryland judge the government had deported someone in error, provided documents to Congress that implicated Emil Bove, Trump’s one-time criminal defense attorney, in efforts to violate Boasberg’s order to halt the deportation of the Venezuelans. According to Reuveni’s whistleblower complaint, Bove, who was acting deputy attorney general at the time, said the administration should consider telling judges who order deportations halted, “F— you.”

Bove denied it. And last week, even though other Justice Department whistleblowers corroborated Reuveni’s complaint, Bove was narrowly confirmed by the Senate to a lifetime appointment as a federal appeals court judge.

“The Trump Administration has always complied with all court orders,” wrote Bondi in her complaint against Boasberg. This is laughable.

A July 21 Washington Post analysis found that Trump and his appointees have been credibly accused of flouting court rulings in a third of more than 160 lawsuits against the administration in which a judge has issued a substantive ruling. The cases have involved immigration, and cuts to the federal funding and the federal work force. That record suggests, according to the Post, “widespread noncompliance with America’s legal system.”

Legal experts told the Post that this pattern is unprecedented and is a threat to our system of checks and balances at a moment when the executive branch is asserting “vast powers that test the boundaries of the law and Constitution.”

It’s no secret that Trump harbors autocratic ambitions. He adores Hungarian strongman Viktor Orbán, who has transformed the Hungarian justice system into an instrument of his own will and killed off the country’s independent media. “It’s like we’re twins,” Trump said in 2019, after hosting Orbán at the White House. Trump has teased that he might try to seek an unconstitutional third term. He de-legitimizes the press. His acolytes in Congress will not restrain him. And now he has trained his sights on the independent judiciary urging punishment of judges who thwart his agenda.

On social media, he has implied that Boasberg is “a radical left lunatic,” and wrote, “This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges’ I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!”

Some of Trump’s lapdogs in the House immediately introduced articles of impeachment (which are likely to go nowhere).

Roberts was moved to rebuke Trump: “For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,” he said in a statement. “The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose.”

Some described his words as “stern.” I found them to be rather mild, considering the damage Trump’s rhetoric inflicts on the well-being of judges.

“It’s part of a longer term pattern of trying to … weaken the ability of the judiciary to put checks on executive power, ” Fogel told me. He is not among those who think we are in a constitutional crisis. Yet.

“Our Constitution has safeguards in it,” Fogel said. “Federal judges have lifetime tenure. We are in a period of Supreme Court jurisprudence that has given the executive a lot of leeway, but I don’t think it’s unlimited.”

With the public records requests, it’s possible that US federal authorities could still successfully cite the investigation exemption and keep documents out of pubic view.","On the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed that his administration would release a tranche of documents in the criminal investigation into disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein.

But since Trump returned to the White House, his promises have fallen flat, with few documents released – and backtracking about releasing more records. The lack of disclosure has prompted not only dissatisfaction among those seeking information about Epstein’s crimes, but political flak Trump can’t seem to deflect, especially about his own relations with the convicted sex trafficker.

But where political pressures have so far failed, legal pressures that have largely sailed under the radar of the fierce debate about Epstein’s crimes could yet succeed and bring crucial information in the public eye.

Several court cases provide some hope that even if Trump’s justice department fails to make good on calls for transparency, potentially revelatory records about Epstein, his crimes and his links to some of the most powerful people in the US might still see the light of day.

Moreover, it is possible that the justice department’s unusual request to unseal grand jury transcripts, in Epstein and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal cases, could also undermine opposition to it releasing records.

One lawsuit brought by the news website Radar Online and investigative journalist James Robertson stems from their April 2017 public records request for documents related to the FBI’s investigation of Epstein. This request came years after Epstein pleaded guilty to state-level crimes in Florida for soliciting a minor for prostitution – and before his 2019 arrest on child sex-trafficking charges in New York federal court.

Radar and Robertson filed suit in May 2017 after the FBI did not respond to their request; the agency ultimately agreed that it would process documents at a rate of 500 pages per month, per court documents.

“Despite the FBI identifying at least 11,571 pages of responsive documents, 10,107 of those pages remain withheld nearly 20 years after the events at issue,” according to court papers filed by Radar and Robertson.

Although Epstein killed himself in custody awaiting trial, and Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence, the FBI is fighting release of more documents. The agency has invoked an exception to public records disclosure that allow for documents to be withheld if their release would interfere with law enforcement proceedings.

The Manhattan federal court judge overseeing this public records suit sided with the FBI’s citation of these exemptions, but Radar is pursuing an appeal that could be heard in the second circuit court of appeals this fall.

“In court, they insist that releasing even one additional page from the Epstein file would hurt their ability to re-prosecute Ghislaine Maxwell in the event the supreme court orders a new trial,” a spokesperson for Radar said.

“It’s a flimsy rationale and we are challenging it head on in the court of appeals. Our only hope of understanding how the FBI failed to hold Epstein accountable for over a decade – and preventing future miscarriages of justice – is if the government releases the files.”

It’s also possible that the justice department’s request to release grand jury transcripts in Epstein and Maxwell’s cases could bolster arguments for the release of records.

“The DoJ’s core argument against disclosure for the past six years has been that it would jeopardize their ability to put – and keep – Ghislaine Maxwell in prison. They say that releasing even a single page could threaten their case,” the Radar spokesperson said. “Naturally, any support they offer to release material undermines their claims.”

Separately, developments in civil litigation involving Epstein and Maxwell could also potentially lead to the disclosure of more documents surrounding their crimes.

A federal judge in 2024 unsealed a cache of documents in the late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre Roberts’s defamation case against Maxwell. Some documents were kept under seal, however, and journalists pursuing release of documents appealed against that decision.

On 23 July, the second circuit decided that it found “no error in the district court’s decisions not to unseal or make public many of the documents at issue”, but it also ordered the lower court to review possibly unsealing them.

Robert’s attorney Sigrid McCawley reportedly said she was “thrilled with the decision” and also said she was “hopeful that this order leads to the release of more information about Epstein’s monstrous sex trafficking operation and those who facilitated it and participated in it”, according to Courthouse News Service.

Others who have represented Epstein victims have called for disclosure of public records – and voiced frustration about being stonewalled in their pursuit of documents.

Jennifer Freeman, special counsel at Marsh Law Firm, who represents Epstein accuser Maria Farmer, previously told the Guardian she had made a public records request for information related to her client, with no success.

Spencer T Kuvin, chief legal officer of GoldLaw and an attorney for several Epstein victims, hopes that public records battles could help pull back the veil on Epstein information.

“I think that the Foia requests will absolutely assist in the disclosure of information. The DoJ has made blanket objections citing ongoing investigations, but through Foia litigation the courts can test those objections by potentially reviewing the information ‘in camera’,” Kuvin said. “This means that an independent judge may be appointed to review the information to determine whether the DoJ’s objections are accurate or just a cover.”

Roy Gutterman, director of the Newhouse School’s Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, cautioned that calls for disclosures – and even government requests to release some files – might not be a panacea for access to extensive documents.

“This case is already complicated, and there were already too many cooks in the very crowded kitchen, and it’s getting more crowded as more public interest grows in the grand jury materials as well as the now-settled defamation case,” Gutterman said.

But stonewalling could also continue. With the public records requests, it’s possible that US federal authorities could still successfully cite the investigation exemption and keep documents out of pubic view.

“Using Foia for FBI and law enforcement materials related to this case, might be a creative newsgathering tactic, but the law enforcement exemption the government is citing might be legitimate because some of the materials are grand jury materials and some other materials might include private or unsubstantiated allegations,” Gutterman said.

“The reporter in me thinks there is an important public interest in revealing these documents, but the law might end up keeping most material secret. Even with the widespread and growing public interest, it might be too big an ask to unseal a lot of this material.

“Practically speaking, the DoJ might also be very selective in which materials it would want to release as well because of the political element involved here, too.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05a374b0faf9fbc85a4ee28c28cd4f577198adb2/239_0_2393_1916/master/2393.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42568eda41e06f20fc44a68254508565",N,,2025-08-04 01:56:45.604495

Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals.
According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes.
The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent.
Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive.","AT THE RECENT graduation ceremony for Northern Essex Community College’s Center for Adult Education, we celebrated the accomplishments of 24 students who had completed their high school equivalency exams, dozens more who finished English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs, 15 inductees into the National Adult Education Honor Society, and six newly naturalized citizens of the United States, who, waving American flags, treated the crowd to a surprise performance of “God Bless America.”

Adult education programs like these are offered by community colleges, school districts, and non-profit organizations across the country, and are in high demand by people seeking a second chance at improving their lives through education; by employers looking for talented, credentialed workers in a tight labor market; and by immigrants drawn to the promise of America.

Recently, these programs seemed to be at risk, as the Trump administration announced that $716 million in adult education program funding that was supposed to be distributed to states by July 1 was being withheld. The administration said the freeze on these funds was due to a wider review of resources allocated to education, under suspicion that, according to a spokesperson at the Office of Management and Budget, “Many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”

Last week, facing mounting criticism, the Trump administration said that it will release the adult education funds – along with more than $4 billion in other funding for K-12 schools and higher education that had also been held back.

That news was a huge relief. Still in place, however, is a directive in letters sent by the US Department of Education to colleges rescinding guidance that had been in place since 1997 that allowed federal funds to be used for undocumented residents in some adult education programs. The letters notified them the “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order signed by President Trump in February is intended to “prevent spending of American taxpayer dollars on Federal assistance for illegal aliens,” and therefore, colleges should no longer admit undocumented students into these programs.

While the focus in these recent announcements is on ending federal support for undocumented residents, it is clear from other White House communications and actions that the broader agenda is to practically eliminate immigration into the United States entirely.

In both of his terms in office, the Trump administration has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens, including:

Family-based sponsorship: A way for a US citizen or lawful permanent resident to sponsor close relatives for a green card that President Trump has derided as “chain migration,” and vowed to curtail by reducing the categories of eligible family members, increasing income requirements, and imposing stricter, more time-consuming vetting processes.

Employment-based sponsorship: A way for an employer to sponsor a foreign national for a green card with a qualifying job offer that Trump is aggressively trying to limit through stricter interpretation of H1-B visa requirements, setting higher wage requirements for work visas, and enhanced vetting of visa applications, which slows processing time and presents barriers for employers seeking to fill vacant positions.

Refugee or asylee status: A process used to recognize individuals fleeing their home country because of a fear of persecution that the Trump administration has nearly eliminated by suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program, suspending asylum applications for anyone attempting to cross America’s southern border, and ending Temporary Protected Status designations for asylees from Afghanistan, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other strife-torn nations.

These steps are in addition to the Trump administration’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, which has been guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution since 1868; and severely limit the number of international students studying at American universities through travel bans, suspension of visa interviews, social media vetting, and other steps designed to dissuade aspiring scholars from other countries from considering American higher education.

Despite this array of restrictions on everyday people attempting to emigrate to the United States, Trump has proposed, and even set up a web site for wealthy foreigners interested in applying for, the “Trump Card,” which offers US citizenship to anyone willing to pay $5 million for the privilege.

The president is not alone in pursuing these immigration restrictions. Although it passed by the narrowest possible margin in Congress, the recently enacted “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” contains a number of provisions, like a 300 percent increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $45 billion for construction of ICE detention facilities, and $46 billion for border wall construction, designed to deter would-be immigrants to America.

Taken together, Trump’s executive orders since January and his signing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act represent a radical shift in federal policy toward immigrants, based largely on myths and misinformation, like claims that immigrants are overrunning the US population, are more prone to committing violent crime, and are taking American jobs or relying on welfare assistance. In fact:

The proportion of foreign-born residents of the US is the same today as it was in the early 1900s. While the share of the population made up immigrants has increased in recent decades, it is now same as it was at the turn of the 20th century. According to the Migration Policy Institute, in 1910, 14.7 percent of US residents were born in other countries. Today, that figure is slightly lower, at 14.3 percent.

Immigration is stabilizing our population. Massachusetts has experienced a net migration of native-born citizens out of the state each year since 2011, and we have slipped from 9th to 16th place in population size. Immigration has been the only way we did not actually lose population overall. And the same is true across New England, which has the oldest average population of any region in the country and, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has noted, is being reenergized through immigration. The consequences of losing population are significant, and include a smaller workforce, fewer consumers, and fewer representatives in Washington.

Immigrants are educated: According to the Migration Policy Institute, 48 percent of recently arrived immigrants have a college degree, compared to only 38 percent of native-born Americans.

Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals. But numerous studies over the years have demonstrated conclusively that immigrants commit fewer crimes and have lower rates of incarceration than native-born US citizens.

Immigration improves our economy: According to a study from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, “Most economists agree that the effects of immigration on the US economy are broadly positive,” and include:

Increased wages: Immigrants often do not compete for the same jobs as native US citizens, putting minimal downward pressure on wages. Rather, immigrants’ consumer needs increase the demands for goods and services, and studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers over the past few decades.

Improved innovation: Immigrants account for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity.

Higher tax revenue: Contrary to one often expressed belief, most immigrants, including those in the country without authorization, pay significantly more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes. The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent. Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive.

Saving retirement: The US population is getting older. In 1990, there were five workers in America for every retiree. Now, there are only three. Without immigration, by 2030 that ratio will fall to only two—not enough to sustain our population of retirees.

Over the past few national election cycles, our nation has seemingly swung from one extreme to another as each party has sought to impose its vision for immigration on a population that appears equally divided over which way to turn.

A few years ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, ever the pragmatist, suggested that what we really need is “A high wall with a big gate,” an approach that would balance our very real need for national security and social cohesion with our equally compelling need for shoring up our aging, birth-rate-declining population with the energy and vibrancy of immigrants seeking a better way of life.

The last time Congress passed meaningful comprehensive immigration reform that moved us in that direction was nearly 40 years ago, when President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants and increased funding for border security, but also provided amnesty and a path to citizenship for nearly three million undocumented immigrants.

President Reagan, and indeed leaders of both political parties until recently, recognized the importance of immigration to the very essence of what it means to be an American.

In his final speech as president, which is worth taking a few minutes to watch as a reminder of why he was called “the great communicator,” Reagan noted, “We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people—our strength—from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.”

Then he cautioned, “If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.”

Four decades later, under the policies being implemented by the Trump administration, we are rapidly spiraling in the direction Reagan feared for the nation.

Reagan added one more particularly poignant point, which was inescapably obvious to the crowd watching those half-dozen newly naturalized American citizens wave their flags and sing “God Bless America” at the recent graduation ceremony for Northern Essex’s Center for Adult Education: “Those who become American citizens love this country even more.”

In a 37-page opinion Thursday blocking the administration from ending Temporary Protected Status for Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua, she accused officials of “racial animus” based on their statements about criminal migrants.

“By stereotyping the TPS program and immigrants as invaders that are criminal, and by highlighting the need for migration management, [Homeland] Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s statements perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population,” Thompson wrote in her opinion.

Thompson wrote in her rejection that she “shares” the “concern” of those suing the Trump administration regarding the president’s ability to end TPS at his discretion. The Biden-appointed judge added that her court “does not forget that this country has bartered with human lives” and included a lengthy footnote discussing the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

“The emancipation of slaves saw the same pattern, but in reverse. Many whites were uncomfortable with the idea of free non-white people in their communities, even if they had lived in the United States for generations,” Thompson wrote in her opinion. “Plaintiffs’ allegations echo these same traditions.”

Thompson also alleges that ending TPS for the three countries and requiring those who had the temporary status to return to their home country is the equivalent of freed slaves being removed from the U.S. and sent to Africa.

Earlier this year, Judge Edward Chen, an Obama appointee on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Venezuela and accused the Trump administration of similar claims of racial animus in his 78-page opinion.

“Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes,” Chen wrote in his March order.

The Trump administration’s official reasons for ending the Temporary Protected Status for the countries have been that the reasons outlined for initially granting TPS are no longer applicable, and conditions have improved.

Other decisions bring emotional responses

While many dramatic opinions from federal judges blocking the Trump administration’s policies have come in TPS lawsuits, judges have also made fiery accusations in other issues. A ruling by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday made another unfavorable comparison about the Trump administration’s policies.

Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, compared the president’s policies blocking the administration from rapidly deporting people who had previously been paroled into the country to the countries that illegal immigrants have fled in her order.

“This case’s underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,” Cobb wrote. “Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that, as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers without explanation or charges … may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?”

Among the various rulings against the Trump administration in district courts, a case regarding the administration’s cancellation of diversity, equity, and inclusion grants at the National Institutes of Health brought another dramatic racial discrimination claim.

“I’ve never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,” U.S. District Judge William Young said in his ruling in June. “I’ve sat on this bench now for 40 years. I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the raids would continue.

U.S. officials have denied the presence of a quota.","LOS ANGELES — U.S. immigration officials continue to release the names and alleged criminal histories of some people detained in recent illegal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, even as the patrols have been effectively halted by a lawsuit challenging their legality.

Among the detentions made by ICE Los Angeles and announced by Homeland Security Investigations are the following:

Alejandro Torres-Rivera, 29, of Mexico. Torres allegedly has previous charges for obstructing and resisting an officer, possession of unlawful paraphernalia and use/being under the influence of a controlled substance.

Jesus Sanchez-Avila, 39, of Mexico, arrested July 31. Sanchez allegedly has previous charges for robbery, carjacking, assault with a firearm and was sentenced to 19 years in prison for gang-related crimes.

Jose Antonio Meneses-Hernandez, 52, a Mexican national, arrested July 31. Meneses-Hernandez allegedly has previous charges for DUI, possession of a controlled substance and trespassing.

One post by ICE took issue with the city of Los Angeles' so-called sanctuary policy, in which local officials are largely forbidden from cooperating with the U.S. government to enforce immigration laws.

Alongside a photo of a detainee, ICE posted the following on Sunday:

""This Mexican criminal alien sexually abused a child under 14 in Vista, Calif. His name's Juan Ocana-Sanchez and ICE Los Angeles got him off the streets because he's a CONVICTED child sex offender. LA sanctuary policy defenders: This is who you protect. Meanwhile, sanctuary policies put the public and VICTIMS at risk.""

Attempts to reach the office of LA Mayor Karen Bass for comment were not immediately successful Sunday. The offices of Council members Hugo-Soto- Martinez, Eunisses Hernandez and Nithya Ramen, who championed the 2024 ordinance that formally established LA as a ""sanctuary city,"" also did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The 2024 ordinance closed loopholes in previous policy prohibiting city resources or personnel from being used to help federal enforcement of immigration laws.

On Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Trump administration's bid to stay a temporary restraining order halting the government's roving enforcement patrols. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ruled July 14 that the patrols were illegally conducted, largely based on targets' race and without reasonable suspicion.

U.S. Department of Justice Attorney Jacob Roth insisted that the immigration stops -- which began June 6 in the Los Angeles area -- were perfectly legal, carefully targeted and conducted with probable cause to make arrests.

""The officers are instructed to find reasonable suspicion before an arrest,"" Roth told the panel, adding that Frimpong's restraining order ""is fundamentally flawed on multiple levels.""

However, the three-member Court of Appeals panel, all Democratic appointees, appeared skeptical during last Monday's oral arguments, and that was borne out by Friday's ruling.

""If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion ,"" the panel wrote.

An eventual appeal to the Supreme Court is expected, where six of the nine justices were appointed by Republican presidents.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson took issue with the ruling.

""No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy -- that authority rests with Congress and the president,"" Jackson said in a statement to City News Service. ""Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview or jurisdiction of any judge. The Trump administration looks forward to continuing to implement its immigration policies lawfully.""

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether the raids would continue.

Bass praised the ruling.

""This is a victory for Los Angeles, and this is a victory because the people of Los Angeles stood together,"" Bass told reporters Friday night outside Getty House, the mayor's official residence.

""I think the administration might have believed that this was going to divide our city, that our city was going to go at each other in division, but we did not. We stood strong, and I am very happy to say that us standing strong ... gave the court the resolve to uphold this decision.""

The rulings stem from Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, a lawsuit filed July 2 by five individual plaintiffs and four plaintiff organizations, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, United Farm Workers, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, and Immigrant Defenders Law Center. The plaintiffs allege that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is operating a program of ""abducting and disappearing"" community members using unlawful arrest tactics, then confining detainees in illegal conditions while denying access to attorneys.

The suit also claims that federal officials have unconstitutionally arrested and detained people in order to meet arbitrary arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

U.S. officials have denied the presence of a quota. Trump administration officials have defended the raids, pointing to the president's many statements during the 2024 campaign pledging to carry out mass deportations of those here illegally, and touting the alleged criminal records of some detainees.

Women and girls fleeing gender-based violence were considered outside the bounds of protection.

Our refugee laws should protect women, because women should not be subject to gender-based violence.","The U.S. has been waffling for decades over whether women have a right to refugee protection when fleeing gender-based violence. Under different administrations, the Department of Justice has established and reversed precedents, issued and repealed rulings. But the latest flip-flop by the Trump administration is not just another toggle between rules.

In July, the Trump administration’s high court of immigration, the Board of Immigration Appeals, issued a deeply troubling decision. The ruling held that a “particular social group” — one of the five grounds for refugee protection — cannot be defined by gender, or by gender combined with nationality. The ruling, in a case known as Matter of K-E-S-G-, is binding on all adjudicators across the country.

The legal reasoning is both unpersuasive and alarming. It seeks to return refugee law to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private matter, not of concern to governments or human rights institutions. It is part of a broader, ongoing assault by the Trump administration on women’s rights and immigrant rights — in this case, attempting to turn back history to 1992.

It was in 1993, at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights, when the catchphrase “women’s rights are human rights” gained global prominence. This was a response to the long-standing focus on the violation of civil and political rights by governments, while much of the violence against women was committed by nonstate actors. Women and girls fleeing gender-based violence were considered outside the bounds of protection. But the Vienna Conference marked a turning point, leading to transformative change in how governments and international bodies addressed gender-based violence — because much of the violence in this world is targeted at women. Laws and policies were adopted worldwide to advance women’s rights, including for those seeking refugee protection.

Under international and U.S. law, a refugee is someone with a well-founded fear of persecution linked to that person’s “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” which are commonly referred to as the protected grounds. Gender is not explicitly listed, and as a result, women fleeing gender-based forms of persecution, such as honor killings, female genital cutting, sexual slavery or domestic violence, were often denied protection, with their risk wrongly categorized as “personal” or “private,” and not connected to one of the protected grounds.

To address the misconception that women are outside the ambit of refugee protection, beginning in 1985 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued a series of guidance documents explaining that although “gender” is not listed as a protected ground, women could often be considered a “particular social group” within a country. The commissioner called on countries that were parties to the international refugee treaty — the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol — to issue guidance for their adjudicators to recognize the ways in which gender-based claims could meet the refugee definition.

The United States was among the first to respond to the call. In 1995, the Department of Justice issued a document instructing asylum officers to consider the evolving understanding of women’s rights as human rights. The following year, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a watershed decision, granting asylum to a young woman fleeing genital cutting. The court recognized that claims of gender-based violence could qualify under the “particular social group” category.

Yet the path forward was anything but smooth. In 1999, the same court denied asylum to a Guatemalan woman who endured a decade of brutal beatings and death threats from her husband, while the state refused to intervene. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno found the decision to be so out of step with U.S. policy that she used her authority to vacate it. And so women remained eligible to be considered a “particular social group” when seeking refuge in the U.S. The view was affirmed by a 2014 case recognizing that women fleeing domestic violence could indeed qualify for asylum.

But that progress was short-lived. In 2018, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions took jurisdiction over the case of Anabel, a Salvadoran survivor of domestic violence to whom the top U.S. immigration court had granted asylum.

Sessions ruled that domestic violence is an act of personal or private violence, rather than persecution on account of a protected ground. This characterization of the violence as personal or private was in direct repudiation of the principle that women’s rights are human rights, deserving of human rights remedies, such as asylum.

The Biden administration sought to undo the damage. In 2021, Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland vacated that ruling and reinstated the 2014 precedent, restoring a measure of protection for gender claims.

Now comes the recent ruling from the immigration court under the Trump administration. Going beyond Sessions’ determination that gender violence is personal, the court is striking at the heart of the legal framework itself by barring gender or gender-plus-nationality as a valid way to define a social group. This erects an even higher barrier for women and girls fleeing persecution. It is a transparent attempt to roll back decades of legal progress and return us to a time when women’s suffering was invisible in refugee law.

The implications are profound. This ruling will make it far more difficult for women and girls to win asylum, even though their claims often involve some of the most egregious human rights violations. But it does not foreclose all claims — each must still be decided on its own facts — and there is no doubt the precedent will be challenged in federal courts across the country.

Another reversal is now sorely needed, to get the struggle for gender equality moving in the right direction again. Our refugee laws should protect women, because women should not be subject to gender-based violence. That is, in fact, one of our human rights.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a1a85b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4064x2134+0+285/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5f%2F0f%2Fc0795c6449d89da5a102ef8a337f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F525623964,N,,2025-08-04 01:56:57.048284

Rowley is a former national editor and foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune.","Six months into Donald Trump’s second term, a lawless president is solidifying his law enforcement powers to create something most Americans didn’t vote for and don’t want: a police state increasingly robbing residents of their rights and due process.

Unaccountable, masked immigration agents, many in plainclothes, are arresting farm workers in fields, raiding Home Depots and car washes, hunting unauthorized workers “like animals,” and grabbing immigrants in courthouses, mothers and children in their homes, high school soccer stars and kids at baseball practice.

Even U.S. citizens have been rounded up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, including children, and other children here legally seeking refuge, some of them sick, along with their parents in the country without legal permission. Many people snatched are quickly deported without due process. Some are “disappeared” into detention facilities or shipped abroad before they can get legal representation.

This hellscape of fear and chaos does not match up with Trump’s campaign promise to mass-deport criminals and arrest “the worst of the worst.” Residents here without legal authorization with no criminal records pleading their cases dutifully in court have been abducted by agents at courthouses. It is a shameful showcase for the cameras, an authoritarian regime running roughshod over constitutional rights, immigrant rights and human rights.

Trump is improperly using the military on U.S. streets, defying court orders, caging detainees in deplorable gulags and dispatching ICE agents to grab anyone they can to meet arbitrary White House quotas of 3,000 a day. He makes a mockery of the rule of law by arresting Americans.

Trump is escalating his war on immigrants as poll numbers on his immigration policies hit a record low. Six months in, the executive orders, court challenges, crypto corruption, firings and budget cuts seem bottomless, as well, and now he is grappling with the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.

And he’s just getting started. Brace yourselves. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. Look for the National Guard or the Marines coming next to Chicago.

Recently, the GOP-led Senate narrowly confirmed Trump’s former criminal defense lawyer, Emil Bove, to a lifetime appointment on the federal appellate bench after he was accused of defying the courts. Bove denied it, but one whistleblower said he told fellow Justice Department officials to ignore court orders if necessary to make sure deportation flights took off, alleging: “Bove stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f––– you’ and ignore any such court order.”

To be clear, Republicans and Democrats both agree that illegal immigration needs to be controlled. A bipartisan effort came close to finding a longer-term solution last year until Trump killed the comprehensive reform bill to weaponize the issue against Democrats in the Nov. 5 election. The question is how to do deal with illegal immigration legally and humanely.

Americans voted to get the border under control, and to be fair, Trump’s administration has done that. Crossings and apprehensions have slowed to a trickle. But they didn’t vote for, nor do they support, what he is doing now: lawless crackdowns leaving migrants and Americans alike living in a republic of fear, danger and violence.

“Show me your papers” used to be the catchphrase for villains in World War II movies. Now, it’s the harsh reality for many legal residents. Migrants who may have crossed the border illegally but are now going through the court system to plead their cases can be swept up and disappeared before their day in court.

Worse, Trump and his top White House anti-immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, deliberately appeal to white nationalists and white grievance, leaving the feeling among immigrants that they are targeted in a deportation war aimed mainly against people of color.

His administration has attacked diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and ICE agents have been accused of racially profiling immigrant communities. ICE denies this, but how many white European immigrants do you see in their detention centers? We have seen this pattern before, when whole groups of people are targeted — such as Japanese Americans sent to internment camps during World War II. The inhumane immigration detention center in the Everglades is Exhibit A.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem insists her immigration agents are behaving legally and building cases correctly. She denies racial profiling: “It’s been done exactly how law enforcement has operated for many years in this country, and ICE is out there making sure we get the worst off the streets,” she said.

It’s not hard to do this legally. Barack Obama and Joe Biden, when they were president, fought illegal immigration within the law. In fact, Obama upset many Democrats by being the “Deporter-in-Chief,” deporting more immigrants at a higher rate than Trump has — and he did it legally.

But Trump’s lawlessness and authoritarian conduct goes way beyond immigration, and it has provoked sustained nationwide protests since he took office. He has threatened a number of law firms into submission, tried to quell free speech and dissent at universities, attacked the media with frivolous lawsuits to try to bend them to his will and silence his critics in the entertainment world.

But his police state tactics are causing blowback too. Americans who care about their democracy must continue to rally to defend it. Only people power and voters can stop a criminal president.

Even his unprecedented weaponizing of the Department of Justice to target perceived enemies has caused revulsion among the ranks over abominations such as his attempt to restrict birthright citizenship. The unit that prosecutes those cases has lost nearly two-thirds of its staff as DOJ attorneys leave rather than further his corrupt attempts to tear down the constitutional system.

Trump’s approach toward immigratioin has squandered his support. Many MAGA supporters still approve of his actions, but a majority of Americans in a recent CBS poll now see his deportation program as a net negative.

Moreover, more Americans now see the value of immigration way more than they did a year ago, with the share wanting immigration reduced dropping from 55% in 2024 to 30% today, according to a recent Gallup Poll — and a record-high 79% of U.S. adults now say immigration is a good thing for the country.

Clearly, the police state tactics aren’t working, and that’s a good thing for America.

Dangling bonuses of up to $50,000, federal officials are launching a massive recruitment campaign to hire more than 14,000 immigration agents, attorneys and other workers to help execute President Donald Trump's border crackdown. The president is newly flush with billions in funding and wants to deport 1 million people annually with the help of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

""America needs you,"" reads one of the ICE recruiting ads, featuring a finger-pointing Uncle Sam, evoking WWI recruiting posters. ""America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.""

The federal spending plan funds the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, making ICE the single-largest law enforcement agency in the country, larger than the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies combined. For comparison, the FBI only has about 13,700 special agents, according to the Department of Justice.

Even before the new hires take their posts, the dramatic expansion of public ICE operations has upset communities from coast to coast, and raised questions about the tactics agents have used as they've chased suspects across Home Depot parking lots, farm fields and into medical buildings.

The aggressive recruitment efforts have also angered local sheriffs worried that deputies in already understaffed offices will be lured away by the big bonuses and higher pay.

""It is tone deaf and reflects a total lack of judgment and character on their part,"" Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriff's Association, said of a recruiting offer emailed to local deputies nationwide. ""This is either galactically stupid or purposefully malicious. You're just robbing Peter to pay Paul. And in this case, you're robbing the poorest of Peter to pay the richest of Paul.""

Massive media blitz, incentives and job offers

Bolstered by new staffing, federal officials have promised to further flood Democrat-run cities with deportation officers in response to a lack of cooperation in executing Trump's get-tough approach that has targeted undocumented immigrations with or without criminal records.

The Department of Homeland Security has already begun hiring for the new jobs. Federal officials are planning a massive social media blitz to reach recruits, potentially advertising on YouTube and SnapChat, but also on connected TVs via Hulu and Amazon Prime.

In addition to the signing bonuses, ICE is offering up to $60,000 in student loan forgiveness, although applicants don't need to have college degrees to be considered for some of the jobs.

ICE officials on July 31 announced they've made 1,000 job offers since Trump signed the funding law. Among those receiving job offers are retired ICE agents who quit during the Biden administration, said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons in a statement.

""They couldn’t do the jobs they signed up to do,"" Lyons said. ""Now, people are lining up to work with us because they know our officers and agents are allowed to enforce immigration law fairly and across the board, and that’s a cause people really believe in.""

Applicants 'should expect a certain level of risk'

White House officials say there's been an 830% increase in assaults against agents through July 14th, compared with the same period last year, and the recruiting materials say applicants ""should expect a certain level of risk,"" but that they will be trained to take ""every precaution"" in remaining safe.

How quickly ICE can bring aboard the new employees remains uncertain. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has long struggled to hire Border Patrol agents, who typically take more than 300 days to bring aboard, according to a 2024 GAO study.

Joe Gamaldi, the national vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police union, said he suspects ICE will face the same recruiting challenges as local departments. He said years of demonizing law enforcement by some politicians, activists and media has created a ""toxic cocktail"" that will make hiring challenging.

""Truth be told, all police agencies are competing for a small pool of people who are still willing to serve and literally die for their communities,"" he said. ""Bonuses and better pay will help, but ultimately police officers, and those interested in police work, want to serve for an agency and communities that appreciate them and don’t treat them like scum.""

Local sheriffs furious about ICE recruitment efforts

The aggressive hiring efforts have frustrated local law enforcement leaders who worry their officers will flock to better-paying federal jobs. Without telling local sheriffs in advance, ICE officials directly emailed recruitment offers to hundreds of deputies across the country.

Thompson, of the National Sheriff's Association, said sheriffs feel betrayed by the move. Thompson said sheriffs agreed to send deputies to special immigration enforcement training designed for local police, only to then have ICE try to simply poach them away.

""It's become a wildfire of discontent, and not how partners treat partners,"" he said. ""This is an embarrassment to this president, and it's sad.""

Thompson said some sheriff's offices currently have vacancies of 40% and predicted the ICE hiring spree could further winnow the ranks of local law enforcement.

Other policing experts have raised concerns about the risks of hiring so quickly.

National-security expert and commentator Garrett Graf, who investigated Border Patrol hiring surges after 9/11, said in a Substack post that ICE risks a surge of applications from Americans ""specifically attracted by the rough-em-up, masked secret police tactics, no-holds-barred lawlessness that ICE has pursued since January.""

Flowers adorned the fence outside Federal Plaza Immigration court as religious and city leaders beat the drums in support of loved ones detained by ICE agents.

One of the latest -- 20-year-old Yeonsoo Go, the daughter of beloved Episcopal priest Kyrie Kim and a graduate of Scarsdale High School in Westchester County. The South Korean native moved to New York in 2021 with her mother.

A lawyer close to the case says Go had an application to extend her current visa, which was set to expire in December. She was ordered to appear in court on Thursday for a procedural hearing on the application. According to the lawyer the judge gave Go a date to return to court in October, but ICE agents met her outside the building.

""She was with her mother. She was heartbroken. And when she called me at night, later that day, she was breaking down,"" said her boyfriend, Leo Chu.

Go spoke to her boyfriend and her friends before the hearing.

""She has been like a little nervous...given the climate and recently so and now her fears have come true,"" added her friend, Gabriella Lopez.

""Her mother gets regular calls from Yeonsoo and she's staying at 26 Federal Plaza, which, as we know is not actually a facility that has showers or beds or hot food. And so the detentions here are not only illegal, but they're immoral,"" said Rev. Matthew Heyd of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.

Immigration Coalition says these incidents are happening more and more and is giving advice for people with upcoming hearings.

""I think it's critically important that anyone who needs to go to an immigration court hearing call the New York State Office of New Americans and their hotline"" said New York Immigration Coalition President and CEO Murad Awawdeh.

It is also important to make sure you create a family preparedness plan and if possible, work with a lawyer to set up a virtual hearing.

Eyewitness News reached out to the Department of Homeland Security regarding the case, but have not heart back.

In the meantime, community members hope their demands to release Go echo throughout Federal Plaza.

Guatemala’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that 14 of its citizens are in the facility, which is surrounded by mangroves and swamps and accessible only by a single road.

The Guatemalan consular network in the United States requested permission from U.S. authorities to visit the detainees “to identify, interview, and learn firsthand about their situation and conditions,” the ministry said in a statement.

Access for Guatemalan officials to the Everglades facility—named after the national park that surrounds it—”was confirmed and is scheduled for August 7,” the statement added.

The construction of the facility on an abandoned airport in that part of Florida has sparked outrage among critics of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, calling it inhumane, as well as protests from environmentalists because of its proximity to a protected nature reserve.

LIZ REINER PLATT: Right.
She has just released a new report, which isso important, Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past andFuture Claims.","REV. PAUL BRANDEIS RAUSHENBUSH, HOST:

Elizabeth Reiner Platt has been leading the Law, Rights andReligion Project since 2015. Her publications have included the report Who'sFaith matters? The Fight for Religious Liberty Beyond the Christian Right -what a good title - which is just incredibly relevant today, as we know. Liz isa legally trained scholar and advocate who leads efforts to reframe religiousliberty in the United States, especially in relation to gender justice,reproductive rights and racial equity.

Just last month, the Law, Rights and Religion Project moved from ColumbiaLaw School to Union Theological Seminary in New York - my alma mater.

And this week, it published the latest comprehensive report titled,Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past and Future Claims.If you have heard Elizabeth Reiner Platt on our show before, you know how goodshe is at humanizing complex policy and legal abstractions. And that's going tocome in useful today as we look at this urgent topic area.

So, Liz, welcome back to the State of Belief!

ELIZABETH REINER PLATT, GUEST:

Thank you so much. I'm very glad to be back.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

This is exciting. It's exciting for all the wrong reasons in someways, that you're putting out this incredibly important report right now, ReligiousLiberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past and Future Claims. I haveto tell you, we're all going insane right now with what we're seeing all acrossthe board about immigration in this country. And it's just disgusting. And forme, you know, I'll just, I know I shouldn't start out with a rant, but I'mgoing to start out with a rant.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Go for it.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

You know, as a pastor and as someone who's just looking at, caresabout our society and cares about people, seeing these masked men abductingindividuals -just terrifying. And so anyway, what you've offered here in thisreport that I really want everyone to know about and to feel like they canaccess is an accessible understanding of the legal aspects of what is happeningright now. And it's a resource for the laypeople, like most of us, but also forlawyers and faith leaders and others. So let me just say, first of all, thankyou for all the hard work this represents. And maybe we can just start out withyour own understanding of the landscape into which this report is dropping.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Absolutely. So the report, it really is about the ways in which,despite the administration's rhetoric on religious liberty, its activities inthe immigration sphere are really attacking people of faith and communities offaith. You know this well with the work you do starting on day one of the Trumpadministration: the revocation of the sensitive locations policy that for 30years said, you know, very basic protection, you can't do ICE enforcementiInsideor right outside of a house of worship or a religious ritual, protectingpeople's right to feel safe practicing their faith, to his attacks on BishopMariann Budde for her very modest plea for…

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

Can we say how modest that was? I mean, it wasn't courageous. Itwas important, but it wasn't like she was being some sort of crazy, unhinged,radical. She was actually just preaching what most would call the Christian Gospel.So, yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt your flow.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

No, no, absolutely. And another thing that you've worked on atInterfaith Alliance, the letters that nonprofit organizations have receiveddemanding information and documents about anything they've ever done related toimmigration, to picking up and abducting, as you said, people on churchproperty, arresting religious refugees, including Christians from Iran,arresting faith leaders… It's horrific.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

It’s shocking. And here's the other really interesting piece ofthis, is going after, literally in the first couple of weeks, going after theCatholic bishops saying they were padding their bottom line - just for thestuff that they've been doing since the beginning, which is caring for refugeesand immigrants. This is not new activity.

But it's really interesting for JD Vance, who apparently is moreCatholic than the pope, to tell the Catholic bishops that they're moneylaundering, that they're padding their bottom line by doing this, the work thatthey're carrying out. It's religious freedom work, which is doing their work.And so I appreciate so much the way you're framing this. All of that should beunder the rubric of religious freedom that is being abrogated by thisadministration.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Absolutely. And, you know, faith communities have, of course, longbeen a huge part of the movement for immigration justice, going back to before this, but notably inrecent history, the Sanctuary Movement of the 1980s, in which congregationsworked with secular activists across the country to protect refugees coming tothe US from El Salvador, were prosecuted for those activities…

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

And even before that, HIAS, for those who don't know, HIAS, it wasstarted by Jewish organizations trying to bring persecuted Jews from around theworld to America. It's a refugee policy. In more recent years, it's beenincredibly important in bringing people of all faith traditions to the UnitedStates. It's completely broadened to all faith traditions. And HIAS, as youmentioned, is one of those groups that has been attacked specifically by theadministration, targeted for its its work, a Jewish-led organization targetedfor its immigration work.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Absolutely. So what the report tries to do is, tell just a smallpiece of that history; but also really talk about how, in addition to the waysthat religious communities have always shown up for immigrant justice throughthe power of the pulpit, through legislative advocacy, through doing that kindof on-the-ground resourcing, providing legal services, social services forimmigrants.

In addition to all those things that we've seen for a very longtime, there seems to me to be an increase in litigation tactics that rely onthe expansive right to religious liberty that has been created under theRoberts Court in cases that you've covered: Masterpiece Cake Shop, CatholicCharities.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

All these cases. This is really an important point, is that thiscourt has really just said, okay, well, basically, religious - and we talkedabout this, I think, the last time we talked was I think the cake, was it…

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Masterpiece Cake Shop.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

That's right. The cake shop. And I was just like, well, where doesit stop? And the idea that, basically, religious freedom has been so expandedthat it's become almost a get-out-of-jail-free card, for some things. I mean, thereinlies the rub.

Okay, Roberts Court, if you want to really expand the idea ofreligious freedom, what are we going to start including in that, and whosereligious freedom is it? Only this thin slice of radical Christian right thatwe're talking about? Or is it really everybody's religious freedom to live outtheir the mandates of their faith? And so I think that's a really importantpoint, because the landscape, technically, should be favorable to this, even ifthe administration is resistant to it.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Right. And, you know, I think it's a hard line to walk between - Idon't want to be Pollyannish and say that claim means advocating for religiousfreedom from a claimant who says that deportation would violate their religiousright to be part of their faith community, for example. I don't want to beoverly-ptimistic about how those places might fare in court. But I also don'twant to be under-optimistic.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

I think we don't want to leave tools on the table, is what I thinkyou're saying. I mean, like, okay, if this is the reality, if you've said thesetools are available to us, we're going to employ those tools. And the test willbe how - and this is, of course, me pretending to be a lawyer because I have alot of lawyers in my family - but, how consistent will you apply the law, ifyou say “religious freedom”? is that is that a fair part of what we're gettingat here?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

That's right. I think some of it is just a commitment to saying, ifnothing else, these laws, religious freedom, should be applied neutrally toeveryone. And it could be applied broadly, it could be applied narrowly, but wecan't treat only some people as legitimately religious. And so I think that's apart of it.

But I also think there are success stories here. There have been acouple really interesting and, to some people, I would say unexpected winsrecently in religious right to abortion litigation, for example. But in theimmigration context, we highlight the case of several volunteers during thefirst Trump administration, volunteers with the organization No More Deaths inArizona, who were arrested for leaving water in the desert for migrants to tryto prevent people from dying from dehydration. They were arrested for thoseactivities, and they successfully brought a religious liberty defense. so, youknow, again, I'm not trying to be Pollyannish, but I also think some of theseclaims do have legs.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

Let's talk a little bit about, there has been litigation in the - Ialmost called it Trump 2.0, which sounds a little too cutesy - in this recenthorror show that is the Trump administration. You know, the law has beenemployed in many ways. And what are some of the ways that you've seen religiousliberty, efforts that do show up, actually, in this report? Because I do thinksometimes there's so much information coming at us and so much news all thetime, and the legal landscape seems just like, there’s so much effort. So it'shelpful to pull out some of the ways that the law has been employed in - andspecifically religious freedom claims has been employed - as it relates toimmigration.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Sure. So I think one of the topics that's gotten the most presscoverage, I'll say, is there are now four lawsuits challenging that version ofthe sensitive locations policy that I mentioned up top.U p until, I think, thefourth one was filed yesterday, right as we were going to print, and I said,you know, “Stop the presses! There's now four!” So we did.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

There's no way to be endlessly current. But yeah. Okay, good.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

So there are now four challenges to that as a violation ofreligious liberty, saying, basically that people have the right to go to theirhouse of worship without being afraid of getting arrested.

There have been a host of cases on just, actually, a reallyincredible range of topics. So there have been two challenges that I know ofsaying that this horrific practice of holding people in third countriesindefinitely violates religious liberty, because as horrible as immigrationdetention is within the United States, there are theoretically legalprotections for religious practice. Those don't exist when you're being held ina third country. So we've seen those challenges.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

Let me just go back quickly to the sensitive spaces, because Ithink this is really also interesting. Some of the litigants in one of thefirst cases that was filed with Democracy Forward included the CooperativeBaptists who - along with the Sikh Coalition and the Friends, Quakers - theyhad never done anything like that before. But they realized that this is theirpeople, right? If you actually believe that you're a pastor, if you actuallybelieve that you're caring for a flock, these are your people who are beingpicked off by masked men and abducted.

And it is a terrible chilling effect on the practice of religionbecause people won't show up for faith, they won't show up to worship. And italso is just really a direct attack on the people that - you know, these arenot super-liberal organizations. These are religious organizations that feelthey have a religious mandate, which allows you, but it also demands that youcare for these people. And I just want to make sure that that sinks in: thatthere are legal things at play here, and underneath those legal things - andwhen we talk about religious freedom, those are commandments.

And in some ways they are, for Christians - in my tradition, it'sdescribed differently in other traditions - but in my tradition, if you'rewelcoming the stranger, you're actually welcoming Jesus. This isn't aperipheral idea; this is a central idea to what it means to actually be aChristian. And so I'm sorry to interrupt, but I do think it's important whenyou talk about sensitive spaces for lawsuits, that's a really important thingbecause this gets to the core of what it means to have the ability to practicereligion.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

And, you know, I think those cases, they talk about the violationof the religious liberty rights of the house of worship, the kind ofcorporation Itself, and saying we are forced to choose between our commitmentto being open and welcoming everyone and our commitment to keeping ourcongregations safe: we can either turn people away and close our doors and say,you're not allowed; or or we can put people at risk. So it talks about thereligious right of the house of worship, but it also talks about the religiousright of the congregants themselves, the immigrant congregants, who, again, theirown personal religious faith is being chilled.

You mentioned these are not extremely liberal congregations. I'llnote that two dioceses of the Catholic Church issued statements basicallytelling immigrant congregants that they don't have to go to mass. you don't getmore of an overt chilling of…

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

It shows you the radical reality of the situation. This is notnormal. This is not okay. I'm so grateful that you're putting out this report. I'mgoing to name it: Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Pastand Future Claims, because it's being put out into a moment that is, Iwould say a crisis for American legal community, religious community andself-understanding of what it means.

So, sensitive spaces, and then also the right to being able topractice your religion when you're incarcerated is, of course, completely gonewhen you're in a gulag in El Salvador. It’s incredible.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Right. Not to mention allyour other rights. I mean, religion just being one of them. But there wereclaims related to land use with Trump's efforts to build a border wall acrossthe southern border and across, again, certain religious spaces, including aCatholic diocese, La Lomita Chapel in Texas, and a sacred Native American siteas well. So there were two cases we highlight there, again, cases of people offaith being charged with harboring, under both federal and state harboring laws,just for their efforts to prevent people from dying in the desert: leavingfood, cooking for people, giving someone a place to spend the night.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

When people talk about, oh, I wish religious folks would do goodfor the community - that's what this is all about. And yet it's being attacked.It's being penalized there.

I don't know if you get into this because it may not directly apply,but for those of us who were watching what was happening in LA, there was a lotof religious activity. I'm sure you noticed that: there were lines of religiousleaders standing up. They were kind of putting themselves in between the policeand National Guard and Marines or whatever and the people.

There was also an incident of ICE stepping onto a church's parkinglot and being located there. And there was this pastor was just like, you can'tbe here. You are on private land, you're on my church's land, and I say, youcannot be here. Those may not immediately be litigatable, but it feelsimportant as far as our abilities to show up and to say what we need to say asfaith leaders.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

I think that kind of situation goes at the heart of the claims thatthey're making in the sensitive locations policy. So in that way it is litigatable.I'll just say the church communities and the religious communities I'm talkingto, like you said, they're terrified. they're terrified of that. I've gottenquestions: Can we keep opening our soup kitchen? Can we keep providing ESLclasses?

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

And they're worried because it looks like they're fostering positiveimmigration locations for people who want to learn English and want to actuallydo well in this country. It's really outrageous.

One of the things that's come up lately is our clergy themselvesbeing arrested. I don't know if you've seen any of those cases and what itmeans to have clergy start to be targeted in - whether it's the chaplain inCincinnati or other faith leaders who are, all of a sudden, being either hauledoff or being interrogated. Have you seen any of that?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

So the the chaplain case I think you're referring to, that makes methink of a couple different kinds of cases that we outlined in the report. Andone of them are incidents of people, both citizens and non-citizens, who werespecifically targeted by the administration, again in its first term, becauseof their faith-based activities.

So one of them is, there was a case by, four women who lived insanctuary churches. These are four undocumented women who were leaders in the NewSanctuary Movement, and themselves had taken sanctuary to protect themselvesand their families. And they were hit with outrageous civil fines for,essentially, failure to self-deport. and the claim they made was, we werespecifically targeted because of our faith-based activities, and this isactually intentionally trying to chill our religious exercise. Now, therewasn't a decision in that case because, thankfully, the civil fines weredropped with the change of the administration.

But there was a second claim that did win, actually, by a UScitizen pastor, Rev. Kaii Dousa. She is a pastor who's worked closely with theNew Sanctuary Coalition in New York, has traveled to Mexico several times tominister and to provide marriage ceremonies for migrants waiting to go into theUS. And she was specifically targeted by the administration. The administrationactually sent an email to the government of Mexico saying, don't let thisperson back in if she tries to enter Mexico again. She argued that, again, thisviolated her religious liberty rights. And she won. So, I think that thosecases come to mind saying that we have a religious right to practice our faithwithout being intentionally targeted.

But there have also been a handful of really interesting claims,none of which we've had decisions in, so it's kind of an open question how farthey could go, but basically saying that deportation itself is a violation ofcertain people's right to religious liberty. So, for example, there was a Seventh-DayAdventist man whose wife and children made a claim that our religious beliefsbelieve in family unity with the man as the spiritual head of the household,and that deportation of him, of their father and husband, would actuallyviolate their religious liberty rights.

So those are kind of two different ways, either the targeting orjust saying, I actually have a religious right to stay in my religiouscommunity in the United States. And we'll just have to kind of see where thosekinds of claims go.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

This is all so important. I want to just invite you to offer areflection, more broadly, on how you understand religious freedom now inAmerica - because what we're talking about is kind of saying, okay, religiousfreedom claims have just radically expanded. And we're going to say, okay,there's consequences to that – meaning, we're going to invite ourselves intothat.

But what are we seeing? The use of religion by this administrationis so toxic to me. Andthe idea of, okay, we have an anti-Christian bias task force that's going to goin, and anybody who says anything against any… And the worst kind of religiousproselytizing, who's using their faith to say, I don't want to serve the LGBTQpeople or whatever. That's really what they're talking about. They can use thisreligious freedom card and they can say, well, we're allowed to do this.

And it's tricky, because we want people to have free exercise. Wewant people to feel free to practice their religion. But often, there issomeone at the receiving end of this, and the consequence of someone saying,oh, well, I don't have to serve you because of my religion. I don't have to beinvolved with you because of my religion. I mean, let's remember, theprohibitions against intermarriage and the segregation of lunch counters. Theywould point immediately to the Bible for that. So, where are we with religiousfreedom in America? I know you think about this too much. I know I’m phrasingit in such a, you know, dumbed down version.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

What a big and important question. So, a huge amount of litigationthat is taking place right now on religious freedom is being litigated,actually, not under the Constitution, but under a statute called the ReligiousFreedom Restoration Act. and what that statute says is that you have a right toa religious exemption from an act of the federal government that substantiallyburdens your sincere exercise of religion, unless the government can show thatthe burden it's placing on you is necessary to advance compelling governmentinterest. And each little piece of that test I just laid out can be kind oflitigated and argued about, but basically, overall, that test should have roomto consider the harms that your requested religious exemption is going toimpose on other people.

We would hope that the government would, for example, find thatthere is a compelling government interest that is narrowly tailored toenforcing major anti-discrimination laws on people. That's not how it's alwaysshaken out in courts, but that there should be room in the test that I justlaid out to consider harms. And I think we absolutely should consider the harmsthat requested religious exemptions across the theological and politicalspectrums might impose on third parties.

But I think the reality is that most of these claims - you know, givingwater to people crossing the desert doesn't impose any of the kinds of horribleharms that we're seeing in some of these other cases. And actually, if there'sa really powerful decision in one of those No More Deaths cases where thegovernment tried to argue, oh, no, no, we have to prosecute these peoplebecause we have this compelling interest in protecting the border. You know,everything you might imagine.

And the court, the judge,said, you're trying to argue that you have a government interest in a policy ofdeterrence by death. That was the court's words. And they said that that'shorrific. and I thought that was really powerful, because it wasn't about, youknow, we can't consider harms on third parties. It was saying, you're trying totell me, government, that you have an interest in people dying of dehydration.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

That's powerful. You've really laid it out clearly, and as yousaid, each one of those words - I've heard the question of sincerely heldbeliefs - that's also like, okay, who gets to say this is sincerely held? So again,how does all of this talk about religious freedom and rights intersect with agovernment that is, by extension, an effort at promoting a certain kind of WhiteChristian Nationalism? You and I have talked about these kind of issues before,but you and I have not talked since this administration took power.

And I do think, it is shocking the level of - I don't know. It's notlack of awareness. It's a very aware intention. I use the phrase, this is themost anti-religious administration we've seen in years, because any religionthat is not in lockstep with their political aims is suspect. And the only oneswho are given this freedom to their religion are those who are viewed as alliesof the administration.

And so it it undermines the very idea of religious freedom as aconcept that is embedded in the First Amendment, and something that we shouldall be grateful for because I am grateful for it. But the way I see religionwielded by this administration has been horrific. You're in the center of it,really looking at the legal aspect of it. And your jaw must be on the floor, aswell.

LIZ REINER PLATT:

It's horrible. And it's also been a very long process. You know,one thing I think a lot about is, the Trump administration obviously has andwields an enormous amount of power; but they also have an enormousinfrastructure and base of this Christian conservative legal movement that hasbeen working for a very long time. I think a lot about resources, and I think alot about the long game. And one of the things that I think our center wasfounded to do and that we try to do is, if you are one of these folks who'strying to find a lawyer to say, I have a religious right as a teacher to misgendermy students, you're going to find it very easy to find a big, well-funded lawfirm to represent your case.

If you are someone who's saying, you know, I have a religious rightto help migrants, to welcome the stranger - there isn't that enormous legalinfrastructure to help you. And so we really - we're a very small shop, but wetry to be very practical in creating legal tools in a very complicated area ofthe law for faith groups that aren't going to be welcomed by, just to name it, AllianceDefending Freedom and the other big Christian right legal players.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

I am so glad you brought this up. And you're absolutely right. Youknow, long game resources - this has been built. I mean, all of it has beenbuilt. The Roberts Court has been built. Absolutely did not come out ofnothing. It came out of an intention. It came out of massive amounts ofinvestment, and a long game plan.

When did, what is it, Alliance Defending Freedom, is that theireuphemism? When were they founded? Do you know, is it like 30 years?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

I believe it's 1993.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

That’s so interesting. So this is also when Ralph Reed, PatRobertson, Jerry Falwell - I mean, that's actually exactly when we were foundedat Interfaith Alliance, recognizing the moment not as a legal organization, butthey were kind of like, okay, how are we going to make sure that, legally, weget what we want? And, and what they want is not what the American people want,but it's where a thin slice of the American people are getting power and theability to wield religion. And it's very frustrating, because I actually thinkwhen you put across the broad understanding of what religious freedom can be,most people get it and they want it, but what they don't like is this idea of, Iget to invade your public school. That is just the craziest thing for me.

I'm not sure that you all do as much in that area, but the wholeencroachment of religion into public schools and kind of dictating a religious normto the rest of the religious community and saying, oh, no, that's justcultural. America was built on that. No, no, no. And I'm just mystified, as apastor and as a parent of kids in public school: you really want some randomperson interpreting the Ten Commandments? All right. Let's have the teacher whogoes through and says, as an exercise today, kids, we have the Ten Commandmentson our wall. Let's go through and see all the ones that Donald Trump hasbroken. That could be an exercise. They're not assured to get what they want.

How do you think of religious liberty? And, in terms of the thisbattle over public schools?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Well, the first thing that comes to mind is the Mahmoud decision,which I'm sure you've already talked about, which is this case that just camedown that said, basically, that public school teachers are now going to have topredict what materials some parent of one of their classmates are going to findcontrary to their religious beliefs, and affirmatively provide an opt-out. It'snot possible to follow. It's simply not possible to follow. And I don't thinkit was really intended to actually be followed for everyone. I think it wasintended to do what the justices wanted in this case, which is, basically, tochill any mention of LGBTQ people in the classroom.

But they're creating these doctrines that simply can't be followed.And the idea, the opinion said something like, you know, of course, how can weexpect parents to tolerate their kids being exposed to these ideas that goagainst their religious belief? And it just seemed so absurd to me.

You know, I'm a religious minority, you understand that yourchildren are going to be exposed to things that you do not agree with or thatdon't match your culture. And it's your job as a parent to talk to yourchildren. I just think of, my daughter had an elf on the shelf in her classroom!It never occurred to me to sue about it.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

During arguments, I spoke with my colleague Maggie Siddiqi. I'm agay man with kids in public school, and my kids go to school with so manydifferent kinds of people. And, you know, I live in New York City. They'resurrounded by people who are not like us. And yet I want my kids, actually, toknow people who are not like us - not because I want them to be something else;it's because I want them to understand that living in a neighborhood that isdiverse, whether that's an immediate neighborhood or a country as aneighborhood, is involves being with people who are different from you, andunderstanding that that's just going to exist.

And, you know, I'm sorry, you can't just say, this is an effort. Ifthey were true, truly, they would say what it is, which is an effort to eraseLGBTQ people from existence, and have only stories that have certain kinds of…You could next say, I don't want any stories that don't have two parents, youknow, heterosexual parents. But if you look at Goodnight Moon - it'sjust a grandma with a bunny. You know, I'm like, I object. Where are theparents to supervise?

So I just feel it's so sad. It's really so sad, the idea that wecan't be around people who are different from us, and we can't learn. I want my kids to learn about other people. Ireally do. And I think that in my school, there's not a lot of other kids whohave gay parents. But they don't feel bad. And occasionally, maybe, there's agay character in somewhere, but they also don't even talk about that. Itdoesn't have to be a major deal. Someone made it a major deal. And I reallythink it comes back to this law machine that has created. I think behind all ofthis is the Defending Free, Alliance Defending Freedom or whatever they are. Youknow what I mean? Like, is really pushing this idea.

And so it just felt so sad to me. And my husband was like, well,maybe we need to go to a private school. And I was just like, that's so sadthat we have to abandon public school because someone has decided to try toerase our family from existence. And if you look at the stories that are there,it's not like: “And here are some gay parents and you should really respecteveryone and even, like, accept them!” They're not even the topic of the story.There's another moral, and there just happen to be incidentally same gender.

Anyway. There's a lot of sad examples, and it's all by intention. Butthere are great people like you and great groups like the Law, Rights andReligion Project that are keeping our spirits up and our hope alive. You have anew report, Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past andFuture Claims that's available. If you're a layperson, you can understandit. If you're a law person… A law person, also known as a lawyer, you can alsounderstand. If you're a faith leader or from a faith community, you canunderstand it. It's a really valuable and readable resource.

Let me just ask what I'm asking everybody. Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaumhas been on the show; she said, nobody can do everything, but everybody can dosomething. And I think that's such an important idea. If there's one thing thatyou would hope that a listener of this program might do as part of their senseof like democracy work or faith work or whatever, what would you love for themto do or be aware of or have in their minds?

LIZ REINER PLATT:

Very good question. You know, one thing - it's a small thing, but Ialways like to encourage people to just take a beat when they hear the term “religiousliberty” in a news article and a law and a politician's speech and just say, what is this person talkingabout, really? A religious liberty right to do what? A religious liberty rightfor who? Because I think one of the ways that we've gotten here is that we'vebeen listening to just the loudest voice in the room on religious liberty, andthat's not actually what they want. They don't actually want religious libertyfor everyone, often.

So it's not the only thing that I think people should be doing, butI think it's a small thing, is just think a little bit more critically abouthow that term is wielded and about what it should mean, and who it shouldprotect and how.

PAUL RAUSHENBUSH:

I love that. Elizabeth Reiner Platt has been leading the Law, Rightsand Religion Project since 2015. She has just released a new report, which isso important, Religious Liberty and Immigration: Legal Analysis of Past andFuture Claims.

Liz, thank you so much for joining me on The State of Belief. It'salways a pleasure to talk to you.

Small business owners and local school district representatives were present along with several officials, including California Assemblywoman Sharon Quirk-Silva, Orange County 2nd District Supervisor Vicente Sarmiento, Anaheim Councilmember Natalie Rubalcava and North Orange County Chamber of Commerce President Andrew Gregson.

ICE raids were confirmed to be in Orange County after ICE was spotted around the Santa Ana Civic Center on June 9. The raids most notably affected the construction, tourism and hospitality industries. Following that week, targeted ICE raids began in Irvine on June 12.

KTLA reports that ICE arrested more than 2,700 immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, there were approximately 236,000 undocumented immigrants living in Orange County in 2019. Out of the 227,000 who were of working age, 67% were employed. The top industries these immigrants were employed in are accommodation and food services, manufacturing, construction and professional services.

“ICE raids are creating fear and disrupting our economy, hurting our local businesses, and putting tremendous pressure on our schools,” Quirk-Silva said in a press release. “We need immigration policies that reflect our values, protect working families and strengthen, not weaken, the communities that make California what it is.”

4th Street Market, also known as La Cuatro, is home to many small businesses and is a social hub in Santa Ana, Calif. The lack of street vendors, foot traffic and open businesses are a result of the impact ICE has had on the community. Business owners in Santa Ana have reported low customer attendance since June 11. According to the California Immigrant Data Portal, immigrants have approximately $354 billion in spending power.

The economic impacts are felt statewide. In Quirk-Silva’s press release, she notes that 45% of agricultural workers have stopped showing up to work, and California’s GDP is projected to decrease by 0.25%.

Private sector employment decreased by 3.1% following raids in Los Angeles, and contributions of $51.4 billion in state and local taxes and $81.8 billion in federal taxes are at risk.

During the press conference, officials also addressed the impact ICE raids have on schools. Many community colleges reported a decrease in student enrollment.

“We’ve heard from students who are afraid to attend class, parents who disappeared from drop-off lines and faculty witnessing the growing silence of a once vibrant classroom,” North Orange County Community College District Chancellor Byron D. Clift Breland said during the press conference. “We’ve seen, in certain areas, a reduction in enrollment go down as much as 50% in ESL and our adult education courses.”

Orange County proposed multiple measures to combat ICE, but few have been successful. In a recent Orange City Council meeting, a resolution that would’ve required ICE agents to reveal their identification while working failed to pass.

Council Members Arianna Barrios and Ana Gutierrez, who proposed the resolution, also requested that the City of Orange add a page to the city’s website with resources to help families who have been impacted by ICE raids. However, that request was denied.

Other cities in Orange County, including Anaheim, Irvine and Santa Ana, have pages on their city websites with resources regarding ICE raids available to them.

In a press conference on June 12, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that ICE will continue to remain in California until they “liberate the city of Los Angeles.”

“We are not going away. We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialist and the burdensome leadership that this governor and that this mayor have placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city,” Noem said in the press conference.

Until then, Orange County will continue to feel the impact.

“Something deeply wrong is happening,” Quirk-Silva said. “These raids have not made us safer, they’ve made us more afraid. They have pulled parents from homes, workers from job sites and children from classrooms.”

The appeals court said that a part of the July 11 temporary restraining order referring to ""except as permitted by law"" was too vague.
The appeals court panel said that the government did not dispute constitutional issues when trying to get the temporary restraining order stayed.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, called the appeals court ruling a victory.
""Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles,"" she said in a statement.","LOS ANGELES — An appeals court on Friday kept in place a Los Angeles federal judge's ruling that bars immigration agents from using a person's spoken language or job, like day laborer, as the sole pretext to detain them.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in its ruling that there seemed to be one issue with U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's temporary restraining order, but it did not put it on hold as the government sought.

The appeals court said that a part of the July 11 temporary restraining order referring to ""except as permitted by law"" was too vague.

""Defendants, however, are not likely to succeed on their remaining arguments,"" the court ruled, referring to the U.S. government.

Frimpong, a judge at the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, issued the temporary restraining order after a lawsuit was filed by people who claimed they were detained by immigration officers without good reason.

Three people were waiting at a bus stop for jobs when they were detained by immigration officials, and two others are U.S. citizens who claim they were stopped and aggressively questioned despite telling agents they were citizens. Other organizations, including the United Farm Workers, also sued.

Frimpong wrote in the temporary restraining order ruling that the people suing were “likely to succeed in proving that the federal government is indeed conducting roving patrols without reasonable suspicion and denying access to lawyers.”

The July 11 restraining order bars the detention of people unless the officer or agent “has reasonable suspicion that the person to be stopped is within the United States in violation of U.S. immigration law.”

It says they may not base that suspicion solely on a person’s apparent race or ethnicity; the fact that they’re speaking Spanish or English with an accent; their presence at a particular location like a bus stop or a day laborer pickup site; or the type of work one does.

Los Angeles has been targeted by the Trump administration for immigration raids that the city's mayor has decried as a campaign to terrorize residents.

The lawsuit that led to the temporary restraining order was filed against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and others.

Kyle Harvick, the deputy incident commander for the government's immigration action in Los Angeles, said that ""certain types of businesses, including carwashes,"" were chosen by immigration agents ""because past experiences have demonstrated that illegal aliens utilize and seek work at these locations,"" according to the appeals court ruling.

The appeals court found that ""the four enumerated factors at issue — apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together — describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop.'""

The appeals court panel said that the government did not dispute constitutional issues when trying to get the temporary restraining order stayed.

“They did not meaningfully dispute the district court’s conclusion that sole reliance on the four enumerated factors, alone or in combination, does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of reasonable suspicion,” the appeals court panel wrote.

Mark Rosenbaum, senior special counsel for strategic litigation at Public Counsel, which is among the groups representing the people who sued, said Friday that the actions by immigration agents in the Los Angeles operation were unconstitutional.

""Today’s ruling sends a powerful message: the government cannot excuse illegal conduct by relying on racial profiling as a tool of immigration enforcement,"" Rosenbaum said. ""These raids were unconstitutional, unsupported by evidence, and rooted in fear and harmful stereotypes, not public safety.""

The appeals court did find that part of Frimpong’s temporary order was vague, relating to ""except as permitted by law"" in the clause about detaining people based on the four factors of race, speaking Spanish, a location or type of work. But it otherwise denied the government's motion for a stay.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, a Democrat, called the appeals court ruling a victory.

""Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles,"" she said in a statement. ""The Temporary Restraining Order that has been protecting our communities from immigration agents using racial profiling and other illegal tactics when conducting their cruel and aggressive enforcement raids and sweeps will remain in place for now.""

The immigration raids launched in Los Angeles in June resulted in large protests in the city, some of which turned violent. The Trump administration sent National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in a move that was condemned by Bass, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin rejected claims that immigration enforcement is based on race or ethnicity, saying agents are targeting individuals who are in the country without legal authorization. She also accused “unelected judges"" of ""undermining the will of the American people.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250708-ice-rs-d1a915.jpg",N,,2025-08-03 04:56:34.869327

The Denver protest was led by Colorado 50501, which also organized “Good Trouble” demonstrations honoring civil rights leader John Lewis on July 17, and “No Kings” anti-Trump protests in mid-June. The “Rage Against the Regime” protests, which were planned in more than 300 cities across the United States, focused on bringing communities “together to transform anger into action, harnessing the energy of collective resistance,” according to the 50501 website.

Several local left-leaning groups, including the Denver chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the immigrant rights group Aurora Unidos CSO, set up booths in front of the Capitol on Saturday.

The demonstrators protested President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the elimination of federal funding for public media by Congress, and mass layoffs at several federal agencies, among other Trump administration priorities.

At around 12:15 p.m., organizers led chants of “When we fight, we win” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” which were met with clapping from the crowd and honks from passing cars.

Brandon Quintanilla, a co-founder of Aurora Unidos CSO, called for protestors to “stand up for our immigrant communities and educate our neighbors.” Quintanilla, 23, said members of his family were deported several years ago, adding that “these attacks on our people have been happening for years, and they have only escalated to unprecedented levels under the Trump administration.”

“We are all well aware of the attacks on our people: masked (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents picking up our parents as they pick up the trash, our siblings being picked up on the way to work or to immigration court,” Quintanilla said.

Protestors yelled “shame” when Quintanilla mentioned the recent federal Republican tax cut and spending law’s allocation of $170 billion in funding for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Denver residents Phaedra Andersen, 54, and Nancy Andersen, 71, have attended several anti-Trump protests in the past eight months. The mother-daughter duo first got involved in community organizing decades ago. Phaedra’s first protest was at age 13, against apartheid in South Africa, while Nancy started out with Vietnam War protests.

“I am hoping that we can break this cycle of human rights violations,” Nancy said. “If anyone’s rights are violated, all of our rights can be attacked. We are on the very edge of losing our democracy.”

Robynn Bartholomew, 52, attended the Denver protest carrying dozens of handmade bracelets beaded with the word “resist.” She stood near the Capitol and handed them out for free to fellow demonstrators.

“I just wanted to do what I could, what’s in my lane, to lift people up, because this is a marathon, not a sprint,” Bartholomew said. “Every day there’s a new thing that can bring you down, but I’m trying to make people smile.

And in many ways, it has worked — particularly when it comes to gender-affirming care for minors.
Mainstream U.S. medical associations have supported gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria for years.
Instead, it has aggressively tried to eradicate gender-affirming care nationwide, regardless of state laws — like those in California — that protect it.","California and a coalition of other liberal-led states sued the Trump administration Friday over efforts to end gender-affirming care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary children and young adults nationwide — calling them an unconstitutional attack on LGBTQ+ patients, healthcare providers and states’ rights.

The lawsuit was brought by California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta and officials from 15 other states and the District of Columbia. It challenges a Jan. 28 executive order by President Trump that denounced gender-affirming care as “mutilation” and called on U.S. Justice Department officials to effectively enforce a ban, including by launching investigations into healthcare providers.

The lawsuit notes the Justice Department last month sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that have provided such care nationwide, with justice officials suggesting they may face criminal prosecution.

Bonta’s office, in a statement, said such efforts “have no legal basis and are intended to discourage providers from offering lifesaving healthcare that is lawful under state law.” The lawsuit asks a federal court in Massachusetts to vacate Trump’s order in its entirety for exceeding federal authority and undermining state laws that guarantee equal access to healthcare.

In a statement to The Times, a Justice Department spokesperson said that, as U.S. Atty. Gen. Pam Bondi “has made clear, this Department of Justice will use every legal and law enforcement tool available to protect innocent children from being mutilated under the guise of ‘care.’”

Trump made reining in transgender rights a key promise of his presidential campaign. Upon taking office, he moved swiftly to do so through executive orders, funding cuts and litigation. And in many ways, it has worked — particularly when it comes to gender-affirming care for minors.

Clinics across the country that had provided such care have closed their doors in response to the threats and funding cuts. That includes the renowned Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, one of the largest and oldest pediatric gender clinics in the United States.

The clinic told thousands of its patients and their families that it was shuttering last month. Other clinics have similarly closed nationwide, radically reducing the availability of such care in the country.

Republicans and other Trump supporters have cheered the closures as a major win, and they praised the president for protecting impressionable and confused children from so-called woke medical professionals pushing what they allege to be dangerous and irreversible treatments.

Bonta said in the Friday statement that Trump and his administration’s “relentless attacks” on such care were “cruel and irresponsible” and endangered “already vulnerable adolescents whose health and well-being are at risk.”

“These actions have created a chilling effect in which providers are pressured to scale back on their care for fear of prosecution, leaving countless individuals without the critical care they need and are entitled to under law,” Bonta said.

Mainstream U.S. medical associations have supported gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria for years. They and LGBTQ+ rights organizations have accused Trump and his supporters of mischaracterizing that care, which includes therapy, counseling and support for social transitioning, and can include puberty blockers, hormone treatment and, in rarer circumstances, mastectomies.

Queer advocates, many patients and their families say such care is life-saving, alleviating intense distress — and suicidal thoughts — in transgender and other gender-nonconforming youth. They and many mainstream medical experts acknowledge that gender-affirming care for young people is still a developing field, but say it is also based on decades of solid research by medical professionals who are far better equipped than politicians to help families make difficult medical decisions.

However, as the number of children who identify as transgender or nonbinary has rapidly increased in recent years, that argument has failed to take hold in many parts of the country. Conservatives and Republican leaders have grown increasingly alarmed by such care, pointing to young people who changed their minds about transitioning and now regret the care they received.

Some of those young people, including Chloe Cole, a prominent “detransitioner” from California, are among the administration’s most vocal supporters. In a post on X last month, Cole praised the closure of the Children’s Hospital clinic in L.A. as the beginning of the end to gender-affirming care in liberal states, writing: “Let’s finish the job!”

The battle has played out in the courts, in part as a state’s rights issue. In June, the Supreme Court ruled that conservative states may ban puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender teens, with the court’s conservative majority finding that states are generally free to set their own standards of medical care.

The Trump administration, however, has not taken the same view. Instead, it has aggressively tried to eradicate gender-affirming care nationwide, regardless of state laws — like those in California — that protect it.

Trump’s Jan. 28 executive order, titled “Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,” claimed that “medical professionals are maiming and sterilizing a growing number of impressionable children under the radical and false claim that adults can change a child’s sex through a series of irreversible medical interventions.”

It defined children as anyone under the age of 19, and said that moving forward, the U.S. wouldn’t “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another,” but would “rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.”

The states’ lawsuit focuses on one particular section of that order, which directed Bondi to convene state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials nationwide to begin investigating gender-affirming care providers and other groups that “may be misleading the public about long-term side effects of chemical and surgical mutilation.”

The section suggested those investigations could be based on laws against “female genital mutilation,” or even around a 1938 law known as the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics.

On July 9, Bondi announced the Justice Department’s subpoenas to healthcare providers, saying doctors and hospitals “that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology will be held accountable.”

On July 25, The Times reported that Bill Essayli, the Trump administration’s controversial pick for U.S. attorney in L.A., had floated the idea of criminally charging doctors and hospitals for providing gender-affirming care, according to two federal law enforcement sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

The targeting of gender-affirming care is part of a wider effort by the administration to eliminate transgender rights more broadly, in part on the premise that transgender people do not exist. On his first day in office, Trump issued another executive order declaring there are only two sexes.

His administration has sought to limit the options transgender people have to get passports that reflect their identities, and the Justice Department has sued California over its policies allowing transgender girls to compete against other girls in youth sports. Many transgender Americans are looking for ways to flee the country.

Still, many in the LGBTQ+ community fear the attacks are only going to get worse. Among those who are most scared are the parents of transgender children — including those who believe their health records may have been collected under the Justice Department’s subpoenas.

One mother of a Children’s Hospital patient told The Times last month that she is terrified the Justice Department is “going to come after parents and use the female genital mutilation law ... to prosecute parents and separate me from my child.”

Bonta said his office has not heard of any parents being targeted, but he hasn’t ruled it out as a possibility, given the Trump administration’s actions to date.

“If they’re willing to use nonexistent law to attack providers, what would stop them from going after parents as well, as they wage these cultural wars?” Bonta said during a Friday morning news conference.

A group of about 100 community members, clergy and Haitian leaders in Springfield, Ohio, gathered this week for several days of training sessions as they prepare to defend potential deportees and provide them refuge.

“We feel that this is something that our faith requires, that people of faith are typically law-abiding people — that’s who we want to be — but if there are laws that are unjust, if there are laws that don’t respect human dignity, we feel that our commitment to Christ requires that we put ourselves in places where we may face some of the same threats,” said Carl Ruby, senior pastor of Central Christian Church.

Ruby said the ultimate goal of the group is to persuade the Trump administration to reverse its decision to terminate legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians in the U.S. under temporary protected status, or TPS.

“One way of standing with the Haitians is getting out the message of how much value they bring to the city of Springfield,” he said. “It would be an absolute disaster if we lost 10,000 of our best workers overnight because their TPS ends and they can no longer work.”

In lieu of that, Ruby said participants in the effort are learning how to help Haitians in other ways. That includes by building relationships, accompanying migrants to appointments with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and providing their families with physical shelter.

Springfield in crosshairs of immigration debate

Springfield found itself in an unwelcome spotlight last year after Trump amplified false rumors during a presidential debate that members of the mid-sized city’s burgeoning Haitian population were abducting and eating cats and dogs. It was the type of inflammatory and anti-immigrant rhetoric he promoted throughout his campaign.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in June that it would terminate TPS as soon as Sept. 2 for about 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States, some of whom have lived here for more than a decade. The department said conditions in the island nation have improved adequately to allow their safe return.

The announcement came three months after the Trump administration revoked legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the country under a humanitarian parole program as part of a series of measures implemented to curb immigration. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal judge’s order preventing the administration from revoking the parole program.

Earlier this month, a federal judge in New York blocked the administration from accelerating an end to Haitians’ TPS protections, which the Biden administration had extended through at least Feb. 3, 2026, due to gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and several other factors.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said at the time that the Trump administration would eventually prevail and that its predecessors treated TPS like a “de facto asylum program.” In the meantime, the government has set the expiration date back to early February.

TPS allows people already in the United States to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. Immigrants from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan and Lebanon, were receiving those protections before Trump took office for his second term in January.

Residents ponder what actions to take

Charla Weiss, a founding member of Undivided, the group that hosted the Springfield workshop, said participants were asked the question of how far they would go to help Haitian residents avoid deportation.

“The question that I know was before me is how far am I willing to go to support my passion about the unlawful detainment and deportation of Haitians, in particular here in Springfield,” she said.

Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a longtime supporter of the Haitian community, was briefed by Springfield leaders during a visit to the city Friday. He told reporters that the state is bracing for the potential of mass layoffs in the region as a result of the TPS policy change, a negative for both the workers and the companies that employ them.

“It’s not going to be good,” he said.

The move came in a ruling by Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that blocked the administration’s termination of a Biden-era program that allowed migrants fleeing Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Haiti to stay in the United States for up to two years. The ruling halted, for now, the rapid removal of individuals paroled into the United States “at any time.”

The Trump administration had announced the end of the program in March. It has since issued a number of other directives authorizing expedited removals by immigration agents and suspended or terminated programs that had allowed various groups of noncitizens to enter the country on a temporary basis.

In her ruling, Judge Cobb said the case presented “a question of fair play,” expressing dismay at what she described as an already tenuous legal landscape shifting under migrants’ feet at the whim of the Trump administration. She noted recent efforts to step up detention and deportation quotas, leaving migrants subject to rapid deportation at the hands of immigration agents, often with little recourse to challenge their arrest or removal through normal channels.

“In a world of bad options, they played by the rules,” she wrote of the migrants admitted under the program. “Now, the Government has not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already here, restricting their ability to seek immigration relief and subjecting them to summary removal despite statutory law prohibiting the executive branch from doing so.”

Judge Cobb, a Biden appointee, also noted a marked rise in expedited removals after pressure from Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, who in May demanded that Immigration and Customs Enforcement step up immigration arrests to 3,000 per day.

Judge Cobb took particular exception to the government’s use of expedited removal more generally, noting that it left people who might be seeking other avenues to stay in the country legally deprived of access to their families or lawyers.

She highlighted the experience of several of the individuals involved the lawsuit, who had sought to remain in the country legally since being admitted but had been arrested by ICE agents immediately upon leaving hearings in immigration court.

“This case’s underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,” she wrote in a passage dotted with case references. “Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that — as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers without explanation or charges — may look to them more and more like the countries they tried to escape.”

“By design, the expedited removal process offers few opportunities to raise objections to eligibility for removal, or to get a neutral adjudicator’s eyes on such objections,” she added.

It was not fully clear exactly how many people were covered by the order, which Judge Cobb wrote applied to “individuals who have been, at any time, paroled into the United States at a point of entry.” As of last year, more than 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela had entered the country through the program, but many people were granted parole from other countries as well.

The ruling came after a federal judge in California blocked the administration on Thursday from pulling protections offered by another program, known as Temporary Protected Status, from around 60,000 migrants from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

The North Carolina General Assembly overrode Governor Josh Stein's veto of a bill that requires greater collaboration between police and federal immigration enforcement.

Legislators bypassed Stein to approve House Bill 318, which strengthens a law passed last year requiring cooperation between North Carolina sheriffs and Immigration Customs Enforcement. The new laws expand when authorities must check the immigration status of prisoners.

Those arrested for nonviolent offenses like fraud or impaired driving must be checked under the new laws.

Veronica Aguilar is the communication director for the North Carolina-based Latino immigrant rights group El Pueblo. She said the governor raised valid concerns about constitutional violations, such as racial discrimination from ICE.

""It will exacerbate fear and uncertainty in our communities,"" said Aguilar. 'We also fear that this will discourage victims and witnesses from reporting crimes, and increasing the insecurity of all communities.""

GOP supporters of the new law say it addresses public safety concerns. It goes into effect in October.

House Bill 318 also delays the start of a mandatory 48-hour detainment period for immigrants while local authorities wait for ICE to take custody, requiring sheriffs to notify the agency before releasing them.

This raises fears among immigrant rights groups of human rights abuses. Aguilar said laws like this passed in other states have been touted as hard on crime.

""What happens is that people fall into the cracks,"" said Aguilar, ""people who aren't committing these crimes, who are not serious offenders, who maybe have never had a criminal history before also end up being affected and detained, deported and separated from their families because of laws like this.""

Aguilar said it's important for community members to know their rights.

Earlier this year El Pueblo released ""Safe Families: An Emergency Guide for Immigrants"" to assist with that.

""One of the things that's very important is that you do not have to state your status,"" said Aguilar, ""and if you are not being arrested then you may ask if you are free to leave.""",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-03 05:56:40.243945

The Trump Administration is committed to restoring integrity to our immigration system and to our justice system.""","A panel of federal judges on Friday limited President Trump's effort to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying his administration can't unilaterally suspend laws that bar the U.S. from deporting migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture.

The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system. U.S. border officials have relied on the order to summarily expel those entering the country illegally, without allowing them to request asylum. Mr. Trump justified the sweeping measure on the grounds that the country is facing an ""invasion"" of migrants.

The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its administrative pause on a July ruling from a federal judge who found Mr. Trump's proclamation defied U.S. laws that require the federal government to hear the claims of migrants who want to apply for humanitarian protection out of fear that they could be harmed if deported.

That ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss struck down the Trump administration's asylum ban and would've required officials to stop enforcing it on a legal class comprised of migrants who are or will be in the U.S.

While it lifted its stay on Moss' ruling, the D.C. Circuit panel also narrowed his order, limiting the class members eligible for relief to asylum-seekers already on American soil while Mr. Trump's decree is in effect. The appellate court also limited the scope of Moss' ruling, partially granting a request from the Trump administration.

The panel allowed the Trump administration to continue using the president's proclamation to deny migrants access to the U.S. asylum system, noting that U.S. law permits, but does not require, the government to grant asylum to those who prove they could be persecuted because of their race, religion, politics or other factors.

But the panel also said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to prevent migrants from applying for other forms of humanitarian protections that the U.S. is legally required to give to certain migrants fleeing persecution and torture. They're known as ""withholding of removal"" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Those protections have a higher legal threshold than asylum, but unlike asylum, they are mandatory, not discretionary, and must be granted to those who meet the requirements.

The panel was made up of Circuit Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, as well as Gregory G. Katsas, an appointee of Mr. Trump. Each judge filed their own statements in the case, with Pillard and Katsas disagreeing with some aspects of the ruling.

While they had some disagreements, all three judges said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to ignore laws around ""withholding of removal"" or Convention Against Torture protections. Pillard said she would've also blocked the administration from denying migrants the right to apply for asylum.

The judges scheduled expedited proceedings to decide the merits of the case, asking both the government and the advocates challenging Mr. Trump's proclamation to file briefs through Sept. 26.

The lawsuit that triggered Friday's decision was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, who have denounced the Trump administration's border crackdown as a draconian policy that has sent migrants to harm's way.

""The President secured the border in record time at an unprecedented level by using every available legal tool provided by Congress,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. ""A rogue district judge took those tools away, threatening the safety and security of Americans and ignoring a Supreme Court decision issued only days earlier admonishing district courts for granting nationwide injunctions. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring integrity to our immigration system and to our justice system.""

Trump administration officials have credited the president's proclamation and other actions — including the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the southern border — for a historic drop in illegal crossings there.

In July, just 4,600 migrants were caught crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest monthly tally recorded by Border Patrol and a figure the Biden administration reported daily during many months. While public monthly reports started in fiscal year 2000, annual data suggest the last time Border Patrol had that level of apprehensions was in the 1960s.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/02/b58ac520-1b0a-4d97-a188-a44d20cc28de/thumbnail/1200x630/10a3016b5bab3459d2720bf39193c2ab/gettyimages-2227352665.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 02:56:27.815569

Joe Neguse joined a dozen House Democrats on Wednesday in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new policy that limits congressional lawmakers’ access to federal immigration detention centers.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security recently implemented a rule requiring members of Congress to give seven days’ notice before visiting detention centers while limiting access to certain Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices.

The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates a federal law that allows for unannounced inspections of detention centers by Congress. While the Department of Homeland Security can issue guidance on how much notice lawmakers should give, federal law allows for immediate entry.

“Such blatant disregard for both the law and the constitutional order by the Trump administration warrants a serious and decisive response, which is why I’m proud to lead the lawsuit we proceeded with earlier today,” Neguse said in a statement.

Neguse’s office raised concerns about reports of “mistreatment, overcrowding,” and “unsanitary conditions” in detention centers.

Detentions of immigrants have risen sharply since the beginning of Trump’s second term, particularly over the past few months. Data released by ICE in late July shows the agency currently holding nearly 57,000 people, a record.

Data shows that nearly half of detainees — 26,474 people — do not have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges, but are instead listed as an “other immigration violator.” Nearly 30% of detainees were listed as having a criminal conviction, while the remainder, less than 25%, had a pending criminal charge.

ICE’s most recent report, as of June 26, also shows that 13 people have died in immigration detention this year.

Lawmakers’ lawsuit comes after several Democrats in Congress reported being denied entry to detention facilities.

Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, whose 6th Congressional District includes a detention center in Aurora, said he was denied entry to the facility in July, despite bringing a printout of the law that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced. Crow is among the dozen House Democrats who joined Wednesday’s lawsuit.

""We look forward to holding the federal government accountable for these authoritarian horrors it unleashed in Southern California, and we invite every person of conscience to join us in defending the integrity and freedom of communities of color across the country.""
""This decision reaffirms that nobody is above the law—not even the federal government,"" said Toczylowski.
""Southern California was never going to back down in the face of lawless attacks on our immigrant communities.","The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit late Friday backed a lower court ruling which found immigration raids targeting people based on their apparent racial identity, language spoken, or vicinity of their capture are unlawful—a decision which dealt a further blow to President Donald Trump's authoritarian policies aimed at migrant workers and working-class communities in California and beyond.

In its ruling, the 3-judge panel of the federal court upheld a previous ruling by a U.S. District Court in early July which found the targeting of migrants during the raids was based not on suspicion of wrongdoing or criminal activity of any kind, but simply for speaking Spanish, appearing to be a certain ethnicity, or being near a location where certain workers tend to congregate, such as a bus stop, large hardware store, or agriculture site.

The ruling stems from a case brought against the Trump administration by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, Public Counsel, workers, and others who argue the raids, which have touched off community anger and unease for months, are, in the words of Public Counsel's senior attorney Mark Rosenbaum, ""unconstitutional, unsupported by evidence, and rooted in fear and harmful stereotypes, not public safety.""

The 9th Circuit ruling means the lower court's ban on such raids in certain areas of southern California will remain in place while the case proceeds.

""Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away."" —Lindsay Toczylowski, Immigrant Defenders Law Center

As the New York Times notes, the latest ruling leaves the Trump administration with two legal options. ""It can ask all the active Ninth Circuit judges to reconsider the panel’s Friday night decision,"" the newspaper notes, ""or it could ask the Supreme Court to issue a stay of [the lower court order issued on July 7.]""

In the meantime—though the legal battle is far from over—the plaintiffs in the case celebrated the ruling and vowed to continue their fight against Trump's far-right, anti-immigrant agenda.

""This decision is further confirmation that the administration's paramilitary invasion of Los Angeles violated the Constitution and caused irreparable injury across the region,"" said Mohammad Tajsar, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California. ""We look forward to holding the federal government accountable for these authoritarian horrors it unleashed in Southern California, and we invite every person of conscience to join us in defending the integrity and freedom of communities of color across the country.""

Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center, another party to the suit, also heralded the ruling.

""This decision reaffirms that nobody is above the law—not even the federal government,"" said Toczylowski.

Newsweek contacted the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Saturday via email outside of regular office hours.

Why It Matters

Donald Trump was elected as president for a second term in November 2024 after vowing to crackdown on illegal immigration into the United States, and his administration has said it hopes to deport at least 1 million illegal migrants per year.

With Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress in addition to the White House, the courts have emerged as one of the main impediments to Trump administration policy. Courts have struck down punitive measures introduced by the president against legal firms involved in cases against him; removed sanctions targeted at International Criminal Court employees; and blocked a bid to strip thousands of Haitian migrants of legal protections.

What To Know

On Friday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a temporary restraining order preventing immigration enforcement agents from detaining people on the basis of their occupation or language was legally valid and can remain in force.

It said part of U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's order had been vague, but added that ""defendants, however, are not likely to succeed on their remaining arguments.""

The initial case was brought by two U.S. nationals who said they were stopped and questioned by immigration enforcement, despite confirming they were citizens, and by three people who were detained at a bus stop where they were looking to find work.

Separately, Friday also saw U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ban the Department of Homeland Security from using a controversial tactic against migrants who had been granted immigration parole, allowing them to live and work in the U.S. legally.

In a number of cases in recent months, the pending cases against such migrants were dismissed after which they were detained outside the courthouse and put through an expedited removal deportation process.

Cobb said that her decision will impact ""hundreds of thousands"" of migrants. It effectively overrules a Trump administration directive issued on January 23 instructing that ""expedited removal,"" a swifter deportation process, should be used widely.

What People Are Saying

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass welcomed Friday's appeals court ruling, saying: ""Today is a victory for the rule of law and for the City of Los Angeles.

""The Temporary Restraining Order that has been protecting our communities from immigration agents using racial profiling and other illegal tactics when conducting their cruel and aggressive enforcement raids and sweeps will remain in place for now.""

Referring to migrants granted immigration parole in her judgment, Judge Cobb said: ""In a world of bad options, they played by the rules. Now, the Government has not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already here.""

Speaking to Politico, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said: ""Judge Cobb is flagrantly ignoring the United States Supreme Court which upheld expedited removals of illegal immigrants by a 7-2 majority. This ruling is lawless and won't stand.""

What Happens Next

District Judge Frimpong's restraining order only temporarily restricted the use of employment and language as the sole factor in detaining suspected illegal migrants, and the full case has yet to be heard.
