Read our updated IBM's Strategic Expansion analysis...","International Business Machines Corporation has now formally closed its acquisition of the data-streaming specialist Confluent, a transaction valued at $11 billion. This move is widely viewed as a pivotal strategic effort to strengthen IBM's position in the competitive field of real-time data processing, a critical component for advancing artificial intelligence capabilities. The completion of the deal, which occurred on Thursday, removes the regulatory overhang that had persisted since the initial announcement.

A Dual-Pronged Growth Strategy Emerges

Market analysts are framing IBM's recent actions as a two-track approach to growth. The immediate focus is on the integration of Confluent, whose technology is built on the industry-standard Apache Kafka data-streaming platform. The core rationale is clear: modern enterprises require live data pipelines to supply AI models with up-to-the-minute information, and Confluent provides the necessary infrastructure. IBM's CEO, Arvind Krishna, anticipates rapid alignment of the two companies' sales networks, with IBM's global consulting arm poised to embed Confluent's solutions directly into existing client engagements. Expected revenue synergies from this combination are a key point of interest for shareholders.

Concurrently, IBM is advancing its long-term ambitions in quantum computing. The company recently unveiled its new ""Nighthawk"" quantum processor, which features 120 qubits. This processor utilizes a novel manufacturing technology based on 300-millimeter wafers, representing a significant technological leap toward the goal of fault-tolerant quantum computers, a milestone targeted for 2029.

Institutional Confidence and Upcoming Financials

Alongside these corporate developments, regulatory filings indicate growing institutional interest. For instance, the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund recently increased its stake in IBM, a signal often interpreted as confidence in the company's medium-term transformation trajectory.

Investor attention now shifts to the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for the end of January. Market participants will be looking for early insights into the Confluent integration process and the combined revenue outlook for 2026. A central question will be the speed at which Confluent's sales team can be effectively incorporated into IBM's broader organization. From a technical perspective, IBM's share price is trading near its 52-week high. A successful execution of the integration strategy could potentially propel the equity beyond the $325 resistance level. This outlook was echoed by analysts at Jefferies, who upgraded IBM to a ""Buy"" rating this week, citing the potent combination of an accelerated software business through Confluent and continued hardware innovation in quantum computing.

Key Takeaways:

BNY launched tokenized deposits to allow on-chain transfers while keeping funds within the regulated banking system.

The service supports faster, 24/7 settlement and programmable transactions for collateral and margin use cases.

The move reflects growing institutional adoption of tokenization by major global banks.

In an announcement published Friday, BNY said it has facilitated an on-chain mirrored representation of client deposit balances on its Digital Assets platform.

The initiative marks the first phase of the bank’s strategy to tokenize deposits, starting with collateral and margin workflow use cases.

BNY Says Tokenized Deposits Mirror Bank Balances On-chain

The tokenized deposits operate as digital book entries that reflect clients’ existing demand deposit claims against the bank.

While balances are mirrored on-chain, they continue to be recorded on BNY’s traditional systems, ensuring regulatory, accounting, and reporting consistency.

The capability runs on BNY’s private, permissioned blockchain and is governed by the bank’s existing risk and compliance frameworks.

BNY said the launch is designed to support programmable, near-real-time cash movement as financial markets shift toward always-on operating models.

Tokenized deposits could help reduce settlement friction, improve liquidity efficiency, and allow rules-based payments across institutional workflows.

Early participants include Intercontinental Exchange, Citadel Securities, DRW Holdings, Baillie Gifford, Circle, Ripple Prime, and several other financial and digital asset firms.

ICE said it plans to support tokenized deposits across its clearinghouses as it prepares for 24/7 trading and settlement.

In September, BNY announced it is making strides towards offering custody services for Bitcoin and Ether, specifically for its exchange-traded product (ETP) clients.

Earlier this year, the SEC’s Office of the Chief Accountant reportedly reviewed BNY Mellon’s approach to crypto custody.

The SEC didn’t object to BNY Mellon’s decision not to include these crypto assets as liabilities on its balance sheet.

The review was key because of the SEC’s SAB 121 rule, which requires banks to account for crypto assets they safeguard as both a liability and an asset on their balance sheets.

BNY Mellon’s unique case with ETPs, however, which bypasses this requirement.

About two dozen drivers and supporters spoke or held up signs calling for safer streets and greater accountability outside the offices of the California Public Utilities Commission, which met Friday to consider further regulations on autonomous vehicles.

A steady stream of Waymo cars drove past the protest, a testament to the growing ubiquity of the white cars in San Francisco.

“I personally am not against technology; what I am against is unfair treatment,” said Joseph Augusto, who drives for both Uber and Lyft. “We have these people, these companies, these autonomous vehicle companies who are driving around the city, and they don’t seem to be held to the same standards as we drivers.”

The California Public Utilities Commission, which regulates Uber and Lyft, is refining and expanding policies around autonomous robotaxis as the industry grows. The California Gig Workers Union says the vehicles should be removed from streets until safety concerns are addressed.

The state agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Neither did Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet.

Hobbled Waymos blocked San Francisco streets during a mass power outage days before Christmas, forcing the company to pause service and raising questions about the cars’ ability to adapt to real-world driving conditions.

In September, a Waymo pulled an illegal U-turn in front of a sign telling drivers not to do that, but San Bruno police could not issue a ticket because there was no human driver. In October, a Waymo crushed a popular neighborhood cat named Kit Kat.

Augusto, the driver, said he saw Waymos stalled at intersections as people darted around them on Dec. 20 when the lights went out across San Francisco.

Snake River is always exploring new product ideas and ways to introduce incredible regional cuts to audiences who may have never experienced them before, Kelso said.
Brisket, she said, will always be BBQ royalty — but there are so many exceptional cuts that deserve their moment in the spotlight.
“If we limit BBQ to just brisket and ribs, we miss out on a world of truly delicious possibilities.
Cooks are experimenting more, “playing with their food,” and pushing beyond traditional low-and-slow smoking into hot-and-fast, direct-flame and other techniques.","Over the past decade, Snake River Farms has seen a steady and significant rise in consumer demand for traditional BBQ cuts — most notably beef brisket, but also ribs, shoulder, and most recently pork collars, said Annella Kelso, the company’s head of e-mail and BBQ marketing. But increasingly, Americans are also open to experimenting with new cuts.

The overall growth, she said, has been fueled in large part by the explosive popularity of competitive BBQ and the rise of BBQ-focused television, streaming, and digital content.

“As more people are exposed to the craft through these platforms, they’re becoming not just fans of BBQ, but students of it. Today’s consumers want to understand the process, hone their skills, and recreate authentic, competition-quality results at home. That passion for mastering the art of smoke continues to drive sustained demand across the entire category.”

Social media allows people to learn how to BBQ in real time — how to select the right cut, how to season it, how to manage a fire, and how to achieve great results at home.

Snake River is always exploring new product ideas and ways to introduce incredible regional cuts to audiences who may have never experienced them before, Kelso said. Brisket, she said, will always be BBQ royalty — but there are so many exceptional cuts that deserve their moment in the spotlight.

Cuts like picanha, bavette (sirloin flap) and outside skirt steak are gaining traction as pitmasters and home cooks experiment with different techniques and flavors.

“If we limit BBQ to just brisket and ribs, we miss out on a world of truly delicious possibilities. What’s exciting right now — and moving into the future — is how open consumers are to discovery, experimentation, and elevating everyday cooking through fire.”

Live-fire cooking is another huge trend that Snake River is tracking right now, and it’s changing the way people approach BBQ. Cooks are experimenting more, “playing with their food,” and pushing beyond traditional low-and-slow smoking into hot-and-fast, direct-flame and other techniques.

That openness, Kelso said, has created space for people to explore unique cuts they might not normally smoke — “and we’re absolutely here for that kind of creativity.”

Tallow is also having a major moment, she added. More people are frying in it, wrapping with it, and using it as a flavor-builder across all kinds of cooking — not just BBQ.

“Wagyu tallow is something we’ve had in our lineup for a long time, and it’s incredibly versatile.

La Bourse surveille de près les chiffres de l'emploi aux Etats-Unis

Les investisseurs sont rassurés ce vendredi par les clarifications du ministère chinois du Commerce, qui a précisé jeudi que ces restrictions ne cibleraient que des équipements de défense. Ces développements mis à part, «les investisseurs préfèrent rester un peu en retrait (…), la prudence domine et les prises de position restent limitées», relève John Plassard, responsable de la stratégie d'investissement chez Cité Gestion Private Bank. Ils attendent en effet la publication du rapport sur l'emploi aux Etats-Unis au mois de décembre, une donnée déterminante pour anticiper l'évolution de la politique monétaire de la Réserve fédérale (Fed), la banque centrale américaine.

Une dégradation du marché de l'emploi serait interprétée comme un signe du ralentissement de l'activité, ce qui offrirait davantage de marges de manœuvre à la Fed pour baisser ses taux, un scénario positif pour les marchés d'actions. En même temps, «des chiffres trop faibles pourraient peser sur le moral» des investisseurs, suscitant des inquiétudes sur la solidité de la première économie mondiale, tempère Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyste pour Swissquote Bank.

Verdict crucial sur les droits de douane

Autre point d'attention majeur des marchés : la décision attendue de la Cour suprême des Etats-Unis sur la potentielle illégalité d'une large partie des droits de douane américains imposés par Donald Trump à ses partenaires commerciaux. Il s'agit de «l'un des plus grands tests pour les actions mondiales» depuis l'imposition de «ces droits de douane en avril», qui avaient fait plonger les marchés, avant un rebond, relève Patrick Munnelly, de Tickmill Group.

ID7,Best Buy,2026-01-09 20:02:16+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Trump Orders Fannie and Freddie to Buy $200 Billion in Mortgage Bonds,"Matthew Goldstein, Joe Rennison, www.nytimes.com, matthew-goldstein, joe-rennison",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/business/trump-fannie-freddie-mortgage-bonds.html,"In a post on social media on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds.
While his announcement was short on details, bond investors reacted quickly to the potential for giant government purchases of mortgage bonds.
In theory, if Fannie and Freddie again became a buyer of mortgage bonds, it would provide a new investor for those securities, pushing up the price of those mortgage bonds, and, in theory, might also help reduce mortgage rates broadly.
Fannie and Freddie are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and its director, Bill Pulte, a stalwart ally of Mr. Trump.
The report noted that the Fed often calmed the markets by buying mortgage-backed bonds.","President Trump said he was ordering the two big government-controlled mortgage finance firms to start buying bonds backed by mortgages, his latest bid to make it easier for Americans to buy a home.

In a post on social media on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy up to $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. While his announcement was short on details, bond investors reacted quickly to the potential for giant government purchases of mortgage bonds.

After the statement, the difference between the interest rates on mortgage bonds and Treasuries narrowed by 0.1 percentage points, a sharp move in that market and an early indication that the initiative could have some effect on the mortgage market.

Some analysts questioned the extent of the impact on consumer mortgage rates over time, given that those rates are influenced by a number of factors, including Federal Reserve policy.

Mr. Trump’s announcement is part of a recent effort by the White House to show it is responding to the public’s concerns about the cost of living and specifically the issue of housing affordability. It is an issue that could dog Republicans in this year’s midterm elections.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted Congress to bar big Wall Street firms from buying more single-family homes to operate as rental properties. Some housing experts have said institutional buyers of single-family homes have driven up home prices and led to higher rents in some communities.

Mr. Trump is also said to be considering asking Congress to permit home buyers to take money out of their retirement savings to pay for down payments.

A move by Fannie and Freddie to buy mortgage-backed securities would be a back-to-future moment of sorts. Buying risky mortgage-backed securities was one investment strategy that got the two firms in trouble in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, when many homeowners fell into default. The federal government was forced to step in and take them over to avoid bankruptcy.

The main job of Fannie and Freddie is to buy mortgages from banks and loans and package them into bonds that are sold to investors. In selling home loans to Fannie and Freddie so they can be packaged into bonds, banks and lenders are freed up to do more lending.

In theory, if Fannie and Freddie again became a buyer of mortgage bonds, it would provide a new investor for those securities, pushing up the price of those mortgage bonds, and, in theory, might also help reduce mortgage rates broadly. Bond prices move inversely to rates.

“There is no question if Fannie and Freddie get back into buying mortgage bonds for their portfolios, mortgage rates will undoubtedly fall,” said David Dworkin, president and chief executive officer of the National Housing Conference, a coalition of affordable housing providers.

Mr. Dworkin, a Treasury official during the Obama and first Trump administrations, said Mr. Trump’s idea was an intriguing one. But some mortgage analysts questioned how much of an impact it would have.

“This could have a small impact on affordability,” said Scott Buchta, head of fixed income strategy at Brean Capital, in emailed comments, with rates falling as much as 0.25 percentage points.

But he added that the move could give a boost to mortgage refinancing activity, which is still economically important.

The average 30-year mortgage rate stood at 6.23 percent on Thursday, its lowest level since September 2022, according to Bankrate.

Mr. Buchta said that if mortgage rates fell below 6 percent, that would be “a huge positive” for the psychology of the market.

Fannie and Freddie are overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and its director, Bill Pulte, a stalwart ally of Mr. Trump. One of the first things that Mr. Pulte did after being sworn into office last year was to appoint himself as the chairman of the boards of both companies.

“We are on it, Mr. President,” Mr. Pulte said Thursday on social media, responding to Mr. Trump’s proposal.

Just a few days ago, the Urban Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank, published a report commenting on the fact that the big market for mortgage-backed securities was “operating without a net” because the Federal Reserve had reduced its role as buyer of last resort for mortgage bonds. The report noted that the Fed often calmed the markets by buying mortgage-backed bonds.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/08/multimedia/08biz-trump-mortgage-bonds-lcfg/08biz-trump-mortgage-bonds-lcfg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 19:03:23.872585

Winners and Losers in the Biotech Shakeup The primary winner in this transaction is undoubtedly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY).
By securing Ventyx’s oral platform, Lilly gains a technological edge over competitors who are still reliant on injectable immunology treatments.
Historically, this move mirrors Lilly’s previous successful acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion purchase of Dice Therapeutics in 2023, which also focused on oral immunology.
Summary and Investor Outlook The acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences by Eli Lilly is a masterclass in strategic M&A, perfectly timed to coincide with Lilly's peak market influence and technical stock strength.","In a move that underscores the tightening intersection between metabolic health and systemic inflammation, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) officially announced on January 7, 2026, its definitive agreement to acquire Ventyx Biosciences (NASDAQ: VTYX) for approximately $1.2 billion. The all-cash transaction, priced at $14.00 per share, represents a significant 62% premium over Ventyx's 30-day volume-weighted average price. This acquisition marks a pivotal moment for Lilly as it seeks to fortify its immunology portfolio and explore the ""holy grail"" of drug development: the combination of weight-loss therapies with oral anti-inflammatory agents.

The immediate market reaction was swift and decisive. Shares of Ventyx Biosciences surged over 60% following the announcement, while Eli Lilly saw its stock jump 3.3% in early trading, clearing a critical technical resistance level of $1,080. For Lilly, which recently became the first healthcare entity to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization in late 2025, the acquisition is seen as a strategic ""bolt-on"" that could yield exponential returns if Ventyx’s oral small-molecule pipeline successfully navigates upcoming Phase 2 readouts.

The Crown Jewels of the Ventyx Pipeline

The centerpiece of this deal is Ventyx’s portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors, specifically VTX3232 and VTX2735. NLRP3 is a protein complex that acts as a ""master switch"" for the body's inflammatory response. VTX3232 is a central nervous system-penetrant inhibitor currently in Phase 2 trials for Parkinson’s disease and obesity-associated cardiometabolic diseases. Data released in late 2025 indicated that VTX3232 could reduce inflammation biomarkers, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), by nearly 80% in patients with obesity. By acquiring this asset, Lilly aims to pair it with its blockbuster GLP-1 agonist, Zepbound (tirzepatide), to treat the underlying inflammation that often persists even after significant weight loss.

Beyond NLRP3, the acquisition brings tamuzimod (VTX002), an oral S1P1 receptor modulator in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, and VTX958, a highly selective allosteric TYK2 inhibitor. These assets are designed to compete in the high-growth immunology market, where the shift from injectable biologics to convenient oral pills is rapidly accelerating. The timeline leading to this deal was catalyzed by Ventyx's successful mid-stage data in late 2025, which caught the eye of Lilly’s business development team as they looked for ways to diversify beyond their core diabetes and weight-loss franchises.

Winners and Losers in the Biotech Shakeup

The primary winner in this transaction is undoubtedly Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY). By securing Ventyx’s oral platform, Lilly gains a technological edge over competitors who are still reliant on injectable immunology treatments. The deal also validates Lilly's strategy of using its massive cash flow from GLP-1 sales to ""buy the future"" of the biotech sector. Ventyx shareholders are also clear victors, realizing a substantial premium after a volatile 2024 and 2025 for the small-cap biotech space.

Conversely, the ""losers"" or those under increased pressure include legacy immunology giants like AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) and Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY). AbbVie, which has long dominated the space with Humira and its successors Rinvoq and Skyrizi, now faces a formidable rival in Lilly that can offer a combined metabolic-immunology approach. Bristol Myers Squibb, which markets the TYK2 inhibitor Sotyktu, may see its market share threatened if Ventyx’s VTX958 proves to have a superior safety profile or better efficacy in Crohn's disease. Furthermore, Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) may find itself playing catch-up in the ""inflammation-obesity nexus,"" as it currently lacks a comparable NLRP3 asset to pair with its own GLP-1, Wegovy.

A New Era of ""Oral Biologics"" and Metabolic Synergy

This acquisition fits into a broader industry trend toward ""oral biologics""—small molecules that offer the potency of traditional injectable antibodies but with the convenience of a daily pill. As the pharmaceutical sector moves toward 2030, the ability to provide oral treatments for complex autoimmune diseases like ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s is expected to be a major differentiator. The deal also highlights the growing realization that obesity is not just a metabolic condition but a chronic inflammatory state, suggesting that the next generation of ""super-blockbusters"" will likely be combination therapies.

Historically, this move mirrors Lilly’s previous successful acquisitions, such as the $2.4 billion purchase of Dice Therapeutics in 2023, which also focused on oral immunology. However, the Ventyx deal is more ambitious in its scope, targeting the CNS-penetrant NLRP3 pathway. Regulatory scrutiny is expected to be manageable, as the deal is relatively small for a company of Lilly’s size and does not present immediate antitrust concerns in any single therapeutic market, given that most of Ventyx's assets are still in the clinical stage.

Technical Breakout and the Path Ahead

From a technical perspective, Eli Lilly's stock is currently in a ""blue sky"" breakout phase. After consolidating between $700 and $800 for much of mid-2025, the stock surged through the $1,000 psychological barrier in November. The Ventyx announcement acted as a catalyst to push the stock toward its all-time high of $1,117. Analysts at major firms have already begun raising their 2026 price targets, with some forecasting a move toward $1,500 by year-end, contingent on the successful integration of Ventyx’s assets and continued growth in the GLP-1 market.

In the short term, investors should watch for Phase 2 data readouts for VTX3232 in Parkinson's and obesity, expected in mid-2026. These results will be the first real test of whether Lilly’s $1.2 billion bet will pay off. Long-term, the strategic pivot will require Lilly to successfully manage a sprawling pipeline that now touches everything from Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s to IBD and obesity. The challenge will be maintaining the clinical momentum of these diverse assets without spreading its research and development resources too thin.

Summary and Investor Outlook

The acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences by Eli Lilly is a masterclass in strategic M&A, perfectly timed to coincide with Lilly's peak market influence and technical stock strength. By securing a leading position in the NLRP3 and TYK2 pathways, Lilly is not just expanding its immunology footprint; it is redefining the treatment paradigm for metabolic and inflammatory diseases.

For investors, the key takeaways are clear: Lilly is aggressively defending its $1 trillion valuation by diversifying its revenue streams. Moving forward, the market will be hyper-focused on the synergy between Zepbound and Ventyx’s anti-inflammatory molecules. As the ""obesity wars"" between Lilly and Novo Nordisk evolve into the ""inflammation wars,"" the ability to provide a comprehensive, oral, multi-disease solution will likely determine the next decade's healthcare leader. Watch for further consolidation in the small-cap biotech space as other pharmaceutical titans look to replicate Lilly's bold move.

As global financial markets transition to an always-on operating model, the demand for streamlined asset movement grows. The introduction of tokenized bank deposits is a response to this shift, aiming to reduce friction and unlock liquidity in financial transactions. This move aligns with the ongoing overhaul of legacy financial infrastructure to accommodate the digital age.

In a related development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have proposed a transition to 24/7 capital markets. Their joint statement, released in September 2025, suggests that expanding trading hours could better align U.S. markets with the global economy's evolving reality. The traditional financial system, reliant on intermediaries, does not operate during nights, weekends, or certain holidays, which can leave investors and traders unable to act when markets are closed.

Blockchain technology, by eliminating intermediaries and enabling round-the-clock operations, offers reduced settlement times, lower transaction costs, and decreased friction in cross-border commerce. Real-world asset tokenization (RWA) is a key component in facilitating 24/7 capital markets, allowing physical or traditional assets to be represented on a blockchain. This approach is particularly beneficial for traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate and collectibles. However, the SEC and CFTC have noted that while 24/7 onchain markets and tokenization are viable for certain asset classes, a universal approach may not be suitable for all. The financial industry continues to explore these innovations as it adapts to the demands of a digital economy.",https://public.bnbstatic.com/images/common/feed-og-image-2.png,N,,2026-01-09 17:14:48.075479

Spark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.
After an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.
Johnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.
Nvidia staffers ramp up responses Following Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.","An internal Nvidia email chain revealed how senior executives at the chip giant — including founder and CEO Jensen Huang — mobilized in response to customer criticism of a key product launch late last year.

The thread offers a glimpse into how the company responds to public backlash as it expands products designed for individual developers and researchers.

The thread, which Business Insider has seen, centered on the launch of DGX Spark, a desktop AI system designed for developers and researchers to build AI products and work on apps for data science, medicine, and other fields.

While much of Nvidia's business targets data center customers, Huang underscored Spark's significance in the thread, calling it the ""ultimate developer's platform — out of the box easy to run all NVIDIA.""

Spark drew criticism soon after its launch, with some citing software stability and performance issues, which garnered coverage in other tech outlets.

An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

Anshel Sag, a Moor Insights & Strategy analyst who has tracked Nvidia launches for 15 years and was an early DGX Spark tester, said the company's long experience releasing graphics cards in the gaming industry — where products are routinely scrutinized — has made it adept at handling public feedback, with Huang typically keeping a close eye on new releases.

In recent years, the company has become even more reactive, Sag said, due to increased internal resources and ""sensitivity about the stock price and how negative sentiment can draw that down.""

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang steps into the fray

In the fall of last year, AstraZeneca executive director Justin Johnson wrote in a LinkedIn post that while the DGX Spark met performance and speed claims, the software experience was buggy and unstable.

After an Nvidia executive shared Johnson's post in an internal email thread, Huang entered the fray.

""Jump on x and say you will fix,"" he wrote.

Subsequently, an Nvidia engineer replied that the company had reached out to Johnson to resolve most of the issues, which were related to a version mismatch of CUDA, Nvidia's software that allows developers to build AI apps powered by its GPUs.

Johnson responded that he appreciated the outreach and was exploring setting up DGX Spark at the pharmaceutical company, the chain said.

Nvidia staffers ramp up responses

Following Johnson's criticism, Nvidia staffers saw other unfavorable responses online and set up a social listening campaign to flag complaints from other influential figures, as well as discussions on Nvidia forums and Reddit, the emails said.

Staffers tracked complaints and engaged directly with key critics who raised concerns about DGX Spark's performance, heating issues, and pricing.

Another incident involved the researcher Christopher Kouzios, who wrote on LinkedIn that he'd purchased DGX Spark to conduct medical research after his daughter died from a rare brain tumor, with the goal of studying cancer risk in his sons.

Kouzios said software incompatibility had rendered the system unusable and that he'd only received an automated acknowledgment 38 hours after filing a support ticket.

After an Nvidia executive flagged the post, team members said they were fixing the bug, according to the emails. The executive later circulated an updated post in which Kouzios lauded Nvidia's customer support.

""While the situation initially frustrated me, Nvidia's response time was exceptional,"" Kouzios told Business Insider. ""In more than 33 years working with large technology companies, I have never seen an organization respond that quickly to public technical feedback.""

It's often standard for hardware to ship without fully finished software, Sag said, adding that Nvidia tends to be more ""high-touch"" than other tech companies in fielding complaints — an approach that flows down from an exceptionally ""hands-on"" CEO.

Nvidia has previously faced some launch hiccups and early criticism for new products, such as its Blackwell rollout, which encountered manufacturing challenges.

While a CEO's involvement is notable and Nvidia's backchannel efforts appeared to placate critics, such an approach isn't without risks, another analyst said.

""C-suite engagement during product controversies has become more common in tech, particularly for founder-led companies,"" said Kate Holterhoff, a senior industry analyst at RedMonk. ""It can signal authenticity and accountability, but it also carries reputational risk if the response is perceived as defensive or dismissive.""",https://i.insider.com/696127a1832e0ef1ead77ac9?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 15:00:34.606467

To quickly recap, the CalPrivacy Board created a Data Broker Enforcement Strike Force to investigate privacy violations by the data broker industry. Additionally, the Delete Act was created to provide a single mechanism for Californians to request their data be deleted from multiple brokers’ databases. The Delete Act requires data brokers to register and pay an annual fee which helps fund the development of the Delete Request and Opt-Out Platform (Drop). Failure to register as required leads to investigations (and fines) by the Strike Force and that is exactly what happened here.

A Texas limited liability company Rickenbacher Data LLC d/b/a/ Datamasters was fined $45,000 for failing to register as a data broker in violation of the Delete Act. Datamasters bought and resold the names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal information of millions of people with Alzheimer’s disease, drug addiction and other health problems for targeted advertising. Additionally, as explained in the decision, Datamasters bought and resold lists of people based on age and race as evidenced by them offering “Senior Lists” and “Hispanic Lists,” as well as lists based on political views, grocery store purchases, health-related purchases and other identifiable means. This was all done while they failed to register with the California Data Broker Registry. The Agency found that while Datamasters tried to comply with California’s privacy laws at various points, those attempts were imperfect and “lacked sufficient written policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the Delete Act….”

For failing to register as required by the Delete Act and complying with applicable privacy laws, the Agency fined Datamasters $42,000.00. The Agency reasoned that not only was this fine warranted because of the failure to register but the head of enforcement at CalPrivacy said that “reselling list of people battling Alzheimer’s disease is a recipe for trouble…in the wrong hands, these lists could be used to target people for more than just advertising and the same risks apply to selling lists of seniors…people who identify as conservative or liberal….” Not only was the fine warranted for not registering as required but given that such personal and intimate information of the most vulnerable members of society was being sold, ensuring that there was accountability was paramount for the Agency.

The second decision required a New York based provider of data and technology known as S&P Global, Inc. to pay a $62,000.00 fine for failing to register as a data broker. From the decision, the Agency found that S&P Global failed to register because of an administrative error as evidenced in the decision that read in part “S&P Global intended to register the company as a data broker for its 2024 activities and S&P Global believed that the registration had been completed….” An investigation was opened as to why S&P Global was not registered and after the company learned that they were being investigated, they quickly acted to complete the registration. However, because they were unregistered for 313 days, the Agency found that the fine was warranted and issued new terms to the company to ensure such oversight does not happen again (to which S&P Global agreed to). Those terms were adopting written policies and procedures to ensure timely registration as a data broker in compliance with the Delete Act and reviewing its procedures for auditing data broker registration status and update those audit procedures as the company deems appropriate to identify missing or incomplete registration.

While the second circumstance seems to be a good faith error as opposed to the first decision, both orders underscore the importance of adhering to the requirements posed by the Delete Act. California has taken a much more active approach in how they oversee the handling of people’s personal information and will look to hold data brokers accountable for any missteps regardless of the reason. These preventative measures are enacted to ensure that the most intimate details of people’s lives stay private unless they consent to disclose such information. California seeks to empower consumers with greater control over their personal data and ensuring compliance of requirements set forth in the Delete Act by the data brokers is a crucial component in empowering the public. These orders serve as a reminder to the companies that acquire and sell data that it is up to them to ensure that they are diligent in adhering to all the requirements.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2026-01/CCPA%20Compliance%20CPRA%20California%20Data%20Privacy.jpg.webp?itok=oG4PgQLc,N,,2026-01-09 14:02:35.396137

Datavault AI Inc. (Nasdaq:DVLT), today highlighted the strategic importance of its New York and Philadelphia edge network deployment with Available Infrastructure's SanQtum AI platform. This GPU-powered, zero-trust edge infrastructure features national security-grade cybersecurity and enables instant data monetization - positioning Datavault AI to address a market opportunity exceeding $2 billion in each selected location with potential annual recurring revenue (ARR) within the Philadelphia and New York metropolitan regions alone, with strong demand and interest within the RWA, digital twins that have strong applicability within the insurance and financial services sectors.

The Philadelphia and New York installation, part of Datavault AI's initial multi-city rollout and planned expansion to 100 cities nationwide in 2026, integrates SanQtum AI Enterprise Units directly into Datavault AI's patented Information Data Exchange DataScore and Datavalue AI agents. Operating within SanQtum's private, quantum-resistant edge environment, the platform allows real-time data scoring, tokenization at birth, and enterprise-grade AI processing without reliance on public cloud infrastructure. This breakthrough capability eliminates latency, reduces security exposure, and transforms raw data into authenticated, tradable digital assets at the moment of creation.

Philadelphia and New York's robust insurance and financial ecosystems - home to major institutions driving trillions in managed assets and premiums - generate vast volumes of high-value data in areas such as risk assessment, fraud detection, claims processing, and personalized financial services. By deploying SanQtum's advanced cybersecurity features, including zero-trust architecture and real-time threat isolation, Datavault AI enables secure, compliant data commerce that meets the stringent requirements of regulated industries. Company estimates indicate an addressable market greater than $2 billion in each market potential recurring revenue per major metro area from applications including near real-time data tokenization, edge-based verification, AI workloads, and secure micro-exchanges.

""New York and Philadelphia represent a cornerstone of our national rollout, where SanQtum's unmatched cybersecurity foundation allows us to deliver what enterprises in insurance and finance have demanded for years: instant, protected, data monetization at scale,"" said Nathaniel Bradley, CEO of Datavault AI. ""With this deployment, we're not just processing data-we're creating a new asset class with national security-grade protection, opening revenue streams that could potential exceed $2 billion annually in this market alone.""

""These two larger deployments that include IBM's WatsonX.ai will be complemented by the Datavault AI and Available Infrastructure build out of 100 locations that each have estimated, and additional serviceable addressable markets (SAM) potential exceeding $100 million from each market. ""

The Datavault AI Edge Network activation will support multiple monetization channels, including:

Real-time quantum encrypted tokenization fees for converting enterprise data into tradable assets

GPU-backed AI processing for financial modeling, risk analytics, and fraud prevention

Per-event revenue from credentialing, identity scoring, and secure attestations

DataScore applications in advertising, compliance, and predictive analytics

Operation of private token exchanges within SanQtum's secure network

Looking Ahead

Datavault AI and Available Infrastructure look forward to expanding this national rollout and supporting additional customer deployments that benefit from secure communications, secure storage, near-edge compute, and secure data processing. As coverage scales across the U.S., the companies expect the combined infrastructure footprint to help accelerate trusted tokenization, exchange, and valuation workflows by placing cybersecure edge nodes closer to where data is generated and decisions are made.

2026 RTIH Innovation Awards

E-commerce will be a key focus area at the 2026 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards will open for entries in April. They celebrate global retail technology innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

Our winners will be revealed at the 2026 RTIH Innovation Awards Ceremony, taking place at The HAC in Central London on Thursday, 15th October.

Check out our 2025 winners here.

Our 2025 hall of fame entrants were revealed during a sold out event which took place at The HAC on 16th October and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by award winning comedian, actress and writer Tiff Stevenson.

In his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “This is the awards’ fifth year as a physical event. We started off with just 30 people at the South Place Hotel not far from here, then moved to London Bridge Hotel, then The Barbican, and last year RIBA’s HQ in the West End.”

“But I’m conscious of the fact that, to quote the legend that is Taylor Swift, You’re only as hot as your last hit, baby. So, this year we’ve moved to our biggest venue yet, and also pulled in our largest number of entries to date and broken attendance records.”

He added: “This year’s submissions have without doubt been our best yet. To quote one of the judges: The examples of innovative developments across both traditional and digital retail spaces were truly remarkable.”

Congratulations to our winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Tiff Stevenson, and all those who attended our 2025 gathering.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/590eeff5b8a79b2147a783be/590ef147e6f2e1fda30e84c5/695fe30724ac16712be7bea1/1767936989706/walmart-thanksgiving-shopping-11.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-09 14:14:22.757808

The Power of Maintenance and Uncertainty The industry rarely celebrates maintenance.

In a fast-moving creative industry, knowing when not to rush is a competitive advantage.","Every January, the industry slips into anxiety. Declarations pile up on timelines. You see new strategies, bold announcements, and huge promises. Everyone appears to be “coming back stronger” or “redefining their direction.” Indeed, the volume is remarkable as urgency spreads.

If you have worked long enough in advertising or creative work, a pattern becomes clear. Specifically, the people who move fastest in January rarely shape the year. Urgency often masks nervousness. It reflects the fear of getting left behind. Furthermore, it shows the need to signal progress before substance exists.

The Psychology of the January Rush

January amplifies this feeling because it follows rest and reflection. Silence feels risky. In fact, stillness feels like a loss of relevance. However, experienced creatives understand something different. Creative power does not come from volume. Instead, it comes from orientation.

January is not a month for proof. Rather, it is a month for recalibration. Confidence does not return on its own after time away from clients and deadlines. Consequently, it requires reconnection. The smartest professionals do not rush back into output. They pause and observe. They clean up systems and refine thinking. Ultimately, they realign priorities before acting.

Strategic Patience vs. Speed

This approach does not signal hesitation. Instead, it signals control. In brand work, pressure often looks like ambition. Tight timelines and constant visibility create the illusion that speed equals seriousness. But speed without direction only creates noise. Noise does not create impact.

The creatives who endure focus on structure, not momentum. They revisit ideas that once mattered. They refine concepts developed in haste. Moreover, they strengthen existing relationships instead of chasing new ones. What looks like slowness often reflects strategic patience.

January rewards restraint. This is when professionals set boundaries before calendars fill up. Senior creatives know that January commitments often become mid-year regrets. Therefore, they choose carefully. They do not act from scarcity, but from clarity about capacity. This selectiveness reflects self-awareness, not arrogance.

The Power of Maintenance and Uncertainty

The industry rarely celebrates maintenance. Yet, maintenance preserves creative strength. Teams align systems and simplify processes. They reduce friction before pressure builds. These actions attract no applause, but they compound over time.

Reinvention rarely arrives through grand announcements. Instead, it unfolds through small, deliberate shifts across the year. Respected creatives do not reinvent their identities each January. Rather, they deepen them.

The ability to sit with uncertainty remains an undervalued skill. January often feels unclear. Direction remains fluid. While less experienced creatives rush to escape discomfort through activity, experienced ones allow uncertainty to work. They trust interaction over force.

Building a Competitive Advantage

Ironically, those who resist urgency often move ahead. Their thinking sharpens and their output strengthens. Also, their energy lasts longer. While others chase momentum in January, they quietly build foundations. This marks the difference between starting fast and starting well.

If January feels slower than expected, it may not signal failure. In fact, it may show awareness of energy, craft, and long-term intent. In a fast-moving creative industry, knowing when not to rush is a competitive advantage. The people who thrive rarely shout urgency. Instead, they move with intent.",https://marketingedge.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image_fx-1-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:00:40.607093

Figure 4. HP debuted the HyperX Clutch Tachi, HP’s first Xbox-licensed arcade controller. (Source: HP)

The HyperX Clutch Tachi expands HP’s gaming input portfolio with a leverless Xbox-licensed controller. Magnetic switches with TMR sensors support fast actuation, while Ngenuity software enables configuration of button behavior, rapid-trigger adjustments, and personalized layouts. The design also supports 3D-printed modifications for users who want custom button shapes or unique artwork.

HyperX is also collaborating with Neurable to develop a headset that interprets brain activity in real time. This collaboration explores how neurotechnology and AI may support player focus and accuracy during gameplay.

All new HyperX products begin rolling out in the spring, with pricing details scheduled for announcement closer to launch.

What do we think?

Together, HP’s announcements at CES 2026 sketched a clear picture of where the company intends to go next. Its new AI-focused notebooks show a commitment to meeting the practical needs of modern workers who move constantly, depend on local intelligence, and require systems that stay secure and serviceable through heavy daily use. The merger of Omen and HyperX signals a parallel shift in gaming, bringing hardware, peripherals, displays, and software into a single ecosystem shaped around player behavior rather than separate product lines. The new systems and accessories emphasize responsiveness, thermal stability, visual clarity, and deeper personalization, giving both competitive and casual players tools that adapt to their pace. HP’s exploration of neurotechnology through its partnership with Neurable adds another dimension, hinting at experiences that react not just to inputs but to the player’s cognitive state. With these combined efforts, HP moves into 2026 with a unified strategy built around mobility, intelligence, and user-directed design.",https://www.jonpeddie.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hp-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 13:00:21.466850

In testing, most of its designs met common preclinical quality standards, and nearly all target proteins produced at least one promising antibody candidate. Cryo-EM studies confirmed that the antibodies bind exactly where predicted, even in complex regions. Chai-2 also generated antibodies for difficult targets like GPCRs and KRAS G12V with relatively few design attempts.

Today, we are looking at diversified banks stocks, starting with PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC).

At their core, diversified banks take in deposits and engage in various forms of lending, which means revenue is generated through interest rate spreads (difference between loan and deposit rates) and fees. Other revenue comes from adjacent services such as wealth management, card and account fees, and products such as annuities. These institutions benefit from rising interest rates that improve NIMs (net interest margins), digital transformation reducing operational costs, and expanding wealth management services as populations age. However, they face headwinds including fintech competition disrupting traditional models (how disruptive is crypto?), stringent regulatory requirements increasing compliance costs, and cybersecurity threats requiring substantial technology investments. Economic downturns also pose risks through potential loan defaults and compressed margins during accommodative monetary policy periods.

The 7 diversified banks stocks we track reported a strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 2.3%.

Luckily, diversified banks stocks have performed well with share prices up 18% on average since the latest earnings results.

Therefore, we revised our assessment of the company’s business risk profile to weak from fair.
The remaining portfolio consists of Callaway Golf, Odyssey, TravisMathew, and OGIO, representing established brands with market recognition and pricing power across golf clubs, balls, apparel, and accessories.
Following the transaction close, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. expects to change its name to Callaway Golf Co. within 30 days.
“We expect Callaway will generate consistent free operating cash flow (FOCF) despite the sale of Topgolf.","“Our leverage assessment incorporates a significant reduction in finance and operating lease liabilities associated with separating the Topgolf business, given the limited lease exposure of the company’s remaining core operations. In addition, all deemed landlord financing obligations and venue-level financing liabilities related to Topgolf are expected to transfer with that business.

“The sale of Topgolf reduces the scale, profitability level, and diversification of stand-alone Callaway. We forecast total consolidated sales of approximately $2.1 billion in 2026, compared with approximately $3.9 billion in 2025 for the combined entity, reflecting the divestitures of both Jack Wolfskin and Topgolf. Therefore, we revised our assessment of the company’s business risk profile to weak from fair.

“Despite the reduction in absolute scale, we expect the company’s golf equipment and apparel segments to demonstrate stable demand trends, supporting low-single-digit percent year-over-year revenue growth for stand-alone Callaway. We anticipate elevated tariff-related input costs will partially pressure profitability, limiting margin expansion. As a result, we forecast S&P Global Ratings–adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 12.0% in 2026 and 12.2% in 2027, corresponding to adjusted EBITDA of roughly $255 million and $265 million, respectively.

“Callaway has repositioned its operating model as a pure-play golf equipment and apparel company focused on its core product offerings. Callaway has simplified its business model following the divestiture of its Topgolf entertainment segment. By exiting a capital-intensive, venue-based operating model, the company is concentrating on its traditional strengths in golf equipment and active lifestyle products, which should simplify operations and improve visibility into earnings and cash flow. The remaining portfolio consists of Callaway Golf, Odyssey, TravisMathew, and OGIO, representing established brands with market recognition and pricing power across golf clubs, balls, apparel, and accessories.

“In our view, this streamlined structure enhances management’s ability to prioritize product innovation, control costs, and allocate capital more efficiently. It also reduces exposure to discretionary entertainment spending and execution risk associated with physical venue expansion. Following the transaction close, Topgolf Callaway Brands Corp. expects to change its name to Callaway Golf Co. within 30 days.

“We expect Callaway will generate consistent free operating cash flow (FOCF) despite the sale of Topgolf. As of the end of the third quarter (ended Sept. 30, 2025), the company had roughly $866 million of cash on hand and $427 million available across its U.S and international asset-based lending (ABL) facilities. We project the stand-alone Callaway will generate reported FOCF of around $150 million annually after capital expenditure (capex) of about $40 million–a steep reduction in capital spending compared with $300 million for the former combined entity. We expect most of its capex will fund technology investments, improve existing stores, and support expansion. The company does not face any near-term maturities, with its ABL facilities maturing in 2028 and its term loan facility maturing in 2030.

“The positive outlook reflects our view that we could raise our ratings on Callaway over the next 12 months if we expect S&P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage sustained below 2x.”",,N,,2026-01-09 14:03:09.991932

The reaffirmed positive sentiment from analysts has arrived alongside solid recent momentum, with a 90 day share price return of 26.49% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 42.68%, suggesting interest in Parker Hannifin’s long term potential is building.

If this kind of aerospace and industrial story interests you, it could be a good moment to broaden your watchlist with that are also drawing attention from investors.

With the shares up strongly over the past year, trading around $906.47 and sitting only a few percent below an average analyst price target, the key question now is simple: is Parker Hannifin still undervalued, or is the market already factoring in the next leg of growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 20% Undervalued

Compared with the last close at $906.47, the most followed narrative sees fair value closer to $907.86, with that view resting on specific growth, margin and valuation assumptions.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $787.857 for Parker-Hannifin based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $880.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $500.0.

Curious why this fair value sits above a wide spread of analyst targets? The narrative leans on steady revenue expansion, firm margins and a richer future earnings multiple. Want to see exactly how those moving parts add up?

Result: Fair Value of $907.86 (UNDERVALUED)

However, you still need to weigh the risk that weaker demand in transportation and off highway markets, or a setback in the Curtis Instruments integration, could pressure margins.

Another View On Valuation

If you zoom out from the narrative fair value of US$907.86, the current P/E of 31.4x paints a different picture. It sits above the estimated fair ratio of 30.1x and the Machinery industry average of 26.3x, yet still below peer levels around 37x. That mix of premium and relative discount raises a simple question: how much valuation risk are you really comfortable with at this price?

Introduction

In the volatile world of global fashion, few brands have successfully navigated the treacherous transition from ubiquitous department-store apparel to genuine luxury prestige. As of early 2026, Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) stands as the preeminent example of this ""premiumization"" masterclass. While many of its North American peers have struggled with brand dilution and heavy discounting, Ralph Lauren has spent the last five years executing a disciplined ""Next Great Chapter"" strategy that has fundamentally re-rated the stock in the eyes of Wall Street. Today, the company is no longer viewed merely as a maker of polo shirts, but as a lifestyle titan with significant pricing power and an expanding footprint in the high-growth Asian markets. With the stock trading near all-time highs and a new three-year strategic plan currently in its first year of implementation, RL remains one of the most compelling narratives in the consumer discretionary sector.

Historical Background

The Ralph Lauren story began in 1967 with a single collection of men’s ties, sold under the ""Polo"" label by a young entrepreneur with no formal fashion training. Ralph Lauren’s vision was never just about clothing; it was about the ""American Dream""—an aspirational mix of Ivy League tradition, English aristocracy, and Western ruggedness. The company expanded rapidly in the 1970s and 80s, becoming the first American designer to open a free-standing boutique on New York’s Madison Avenue.

The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1997. For much of the early 2000s, Ralph Lauren expanded its reach through extensive licensing and a heavy reliance on wholesale partners like Macy’s (NYSE: M). However, this strategy eventually led to brand over-exposure and excessive discounting. The turning point arrived in 2017 with the appointment of Patrice Louvet, a veteran from Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), who partnered with the founder to initiate a radical multi-year transformation aimed at elevating the brand and reclaiming its luxury status.

Business Model

Ralph Lauren operates a vertically integrated business model that balances global scale with localized agility. The company’s revenue is generated through three primary channels:

Direct-to-Consumer (DTC): This is the core of the company’s modern strategy, comprising owned retail stores and a robust e-commerce platform. In late 2025, DTC accounted for nearly two-thirds of total revenue, up significantly from previous years.

Wholesale: This includes sales to premier department stores and specialty retailers. The company has deliberately reduced its wholesale footprint—particularly in ""off-price"" channels—to preserve brand equity.

Licensing: While smaller in terms of direct revenue, licensing allows the brand to extend into lifestyle categories like fragrances, eyewear, and home furnishings through partnerships with experts in those fields.

Geographically, Ralph Lauren is a global powerhouse. While North America remains its largest market, Europe and Asia (particularly Greater China) have become the primary engines of margin-accretive growth, with Asia now representing the most profitable segment on a per-unit basis.

Stock Performance Overview

Ralph Lauren has been a standout performer in the ""post-pandemic"" era, delivering exceptional returns for shareholders who recognized its structural shift early.

1-Year Performance: Over the past twelve months, RL has gained approximately 58%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and the broader retail index.

5-Year Performance: Investors who bought in 2021 have seen their holdings nearly triple. The stock’s rally accelerated in late 2024 as the market began to reward RL's consistent earnings beats and margin expansion.

10-Year Performance: On a decade-long horizon, the stock reflects the ""V-shaped"" recovery of the brand—from a period of stagnation in 2015-2017 to a powerhouse trajectory starting in late 2022. As of January 2026, RL is trading near $360, up from the sub-$100 levels seen during the depths of the 2020 market cycle.

Financial Performance

PredictStreet’s analysis of Ralph Lauren’s most recent fiscal results (ending mid-2025) reveals a company operating at peak efficiency.

Revenue Growth: Fiscal year 2025 revenue reached $7.10 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year. This growth was notably achieved despite a deliberate 10% reduction in sales to off-price wholesale channels.

Operating Margins: Adjusted operating margins climbed to 14.0% in 2025, a 150-basis-point expansion from the prior year. This was driven by a cumulative 60% increase in Average Unit Retail (AUR) over the last five years.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company reported adjusted EPS of $12.33 in 2025, a 20% increase over 2024.

Balance Sheet: Ralph Lauren maintains a fortress balance sheet with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and a net cash position. This liquidity has supported a consistent dividend and aggressive share buybacks, totaling over $600 million in the last fiscal year.

Leadership and Management

The leadership at Ralph Lauren is defined by a unique partnership between creative vision and operational discipline.

Patrice Louvet (President & CEO): Louvet has been the architect of the brand’s financial turnaround. His ""Next Great Chapter"" plans have prioritized digital transformation, marketing ROI, and geographic optimization.

Ralph Lauren (Executive Chairman & Chief Creative Officer): At 86, the founder remains the soul of the company. He continues to oversee every creative aspect of the brand, ensuring that the ""lifestyle"" narrative remains coherent across all product lines.

Justin Picicci (CFO): Appointed in 2024, Picicci has maintained a strict focus on inventory management and capital allocation, earning him high marks from the analyst community.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Ralph Lauren’s product strategy is built on a ""tiered"" architecture that captures the full spectrum of the luxury market:

Luxury Pinnacle: The Purple Label and Ralph Lauren Collection (Women’s) compete with the likes of Hermes and Loro Piana. These lines have seen double-digit growth as the ""quiet luxury"" trend remains a dominant force in 2026.

Core Polo: The Polo Ralph Lauren brand has been successfully elevated, with a focus on icons like the cable-knit sweater and the Oxford shirt.

Category Expansion: The ""Next Great Chapter: Drive"" plan, launched in late 2025, focuses on expanding underpenetrated high-margin categories, specifically handbags, outerwear, and home decor.

Innovation: The company has integrated AI into its supply chain to predict demand at a hyper-local level, reducing markdowns and improving full-price sell-through rates.

Competitive Landscape

In the current market, Ralph Lauren is increasingly compared to European luxury conglomerates rather than its traditional American rivals.

vs. PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH): While PVH (owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein) has struggled with wholesale reliance in North America, RL has pivoted more aggressively to DTC.

vs. Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) and Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI): Tapestry (Coach) and Capri (Michael Kors) have focused on ""accessible luxury,"" which has proven more susceptible to macro-economic headwinds. Ralph Lauren’s more diversified lifestyle brand and higher price points have shielded it from the volatility seen by these handbag-centric firms.

Market Share: RL has successfully gained share in the ""premium menswear"" and ""luxury sportswear"" categories, particularly in Western Europe and the Tier-1 cities of China.

Industry and Market Trends

Several macro trends are currently favoring the Ralph Lauren business model:

Brand Elevation/Quiet Luxury: The shift away from loud logos toward timeless, high-quality garments plays directly into Ralph Lauren’s core aesthetic.

Asian Middle-Class Growth: Despite broader macro concerns in China, the demand for ""classic Americana"" remains robust among the Chinese upper-middle class, where RL is perceived as a top-tier aspirational brand.

Digital/Physical Integration: The ""Win in Key Cities"" strategy uses flagship ""World of Ralph Lauren"" stores (including Ralph’s Coffee shops) to drive both physical and digital sales within a 50-mile radius, a model that has significantly boosted customer lifetime value.

Risks and Challenges

Despite the current momentum, several risks remain:

Macro-Economic Sensitivity: A significant global recession would likely dampen demand for even premium luxury goods, particularly in the ""Lauren"" and ""Polo"" segments which have more exposure to aspirational (vs. ultra-high-net-worth) consumers.

Tariff and Trade Policy: With evolving US trade policies in 2025 and 2026, any major increase in tariffs on goods from Asia could pressure gross margins, although the company has diversified its sourcing away from China (now less than 20% of production).

Succession Planning: While the company has a deep bench of professional talent, the eventual departure of Ralph Lauren himself—whose personal brand is inextricably linked to the company—poses a long-term narrative risk.

Opportunities and Catalysts

Looking forward to the remainder of 2026 and 2027, several catalysts could drive further upside:

Handbag Penetration: Handbags currently represent a small fraction of RL’s revenue compared to peers like Coach or Gucci. The 2025 launch of the ""RL 888"" and ""Polo ID"" collections represents a major push into this high-margin category.

China Recovery: If the Chinese economy sees a broader stimulus-led recovery in 2026, RL is better positioned than almost any other US retailer to capture that upside.

Earnings Consistency: The company has a multi-year streak of beating analyst estimates. Continued execution of the ""Drive"" strategy (FY26-FY28) targets another 100-150 bps of margin expansion.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Sentiment on Wall Street is overwhelmingly positive. As of January 9, 2026, a majority of analysts covering RL maintain a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" rating.

Price Targets: Recent targets from major institutions range from $400 to $435, suggesting a 10-20% upside from current levels.

Institutional Activity: There has been a notable increase in institutional ownership from ""quality"" and ""growth"" oriented funds over the last 18 months, shifting away from the ""value"" funds that previously dominated the shareholder base.

PredictStreet View: Our AI-generated earnings models suggest RL is well-positioned to exceed the consensus EPS of $13.50 for the current fiscal year, driven by stronger-than-expected holiday performance and continued AUR growth.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Ralph Lauren is navigating a complex regulatory environment:

ESG and Sustainability: The company is under increasing pressure from EU regulations regarding textile recycling and supply chain transparency. RL has committed to 100% sustainably sourced key materials by 2030, a goal that requires significant R&D investment.

Geopolitics: The ""China+1"" sourcing strategy is nearly complete, with increased production in Vietnam, India, and Turkey, mitigating the risk of sudden geopolitical shifts in East Asia.

Conclusion

Ralph Lauren Corporation (NYSE: RL) has successfully navigated the most difficult era in modern retail by doubling down on brand heritage while modernizing its operational backbone. By choosing to sell fewer items at higher prices and focusing on direct relationships with consumers, management has transformed the company from a cyclical apparel play into a structural luxury winner.

For investors, RL represents a rare combination of top-line growth, margin expansion, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. While the stock's valuation is no longer ""cheap"" by historical standards, it remains attractive relative to European luxury peers and reflects a business that is fundamentally more profitable and resilient than it was a decade ago. Investors should watch for the upcoming Q3 earnings report (February 2026) for confirmation that the ""Drive"" strategic plan is delivering on its handbag and outerwear expansion goals.

(NG) announces that Donlin Gold LLC (“Donlin Gold”), which is owned 60% by NOVAGOLD and 40% by Paulson Advisers LLC (“Paulson”), and Glenfarne Alaska LNG, LLC (“Glenfarne”), majority owner and developer of the Alaska LNG Project (“Alaska LNG”), signed a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for natural gas supply from the Alaska LNG Pipeline and the development of the infrastructure needed to deliver the gas and power the proposed mine.

Under the LOI, Glenfarne and Donlin Gold will continue to evaluate ways to formalize a potential natural gas sales agreement for up to 50 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and cooperate on the most effective method for development and construction of the Donlin Gold natural gas pipeline. The pipeline extends from Southcentral Alaska to the Donlin Gold project in Southwest Alaska and will feed a power plant to supply electricity to the proposed mine.

“A reliable, secure supply of economic natural gas from Alaska LNG has the potential to substantially enhance our ability to unlock value and upside potential in Donlin Gold,” said John Paulson, President of Paulson. “Glenfarne’s global energy experience is well-suited to provide a long-term turnkey energy solution that helps advance this opportunity.”

“Powering Donlin Gold with natural gas from Alaska LNG could offer major advantages for the proposed mine and the Southwestern Alaska region by harnessing the strategic potential of such an important gold endowment for the industry and the United States,” said Greg Lang, NOVAGOLD’s President and CEO. “Aligning Alaska LNG and Donlin Gold’s pipeline schedules could reduce fuel costs, optimize transportation and logistics, streamline material procurement, and leverage shared expertise to lower overall project expenses.”

“Alaska LNG offers abundant low-cost natural gas that will enhance the economics and facilitate development of energy-intensive mining projects in Alaska,” said Glenfarne Alaska LNG President Adam Prestidge. “We have great confidence in the future success of Donlin Gold following the significant investment by Paulson. Adding a foundational customer like Donlin Gold, one of the largest known undeveloped gold deposits in the world, Alaska LNG provides significant volume discount benefits that will result in lower energy costs for Alaska consumers. As we continue to add more pipeline customers, the cost of gas for Alaskans will continue to go down.”

Donlin Gold Natural Gas Pipeline & Permitting

As per the 2021 Technical Report (as defined below) and the S-K 1300 Technical Report Summary (as defined below), Donlin Gold envisions a buried, 316-mile natural gas pipeline from an existing 20-inch natural gas pipeline near Beluga, Alaska to the Donlin Gold mine site to supply reliable, lower-carbon emitting, energy for mining operations. Key federal and state permits for the pipeline route have been issued. Recently the State of Alaska Supreme Court upheld the Alaska Department Natural Resources issuance of the pipeline right-of-way lease. Supplemental environmental review is ongoing under the Fixing America’s Transportation Act (“FAST-41”) program, coordinated by the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leading a court-directed Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement.

Donlin Gold Bankable Feasibility Study Update

Donlin Gold continues to advance the selection of a prime contractor for the Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS), having received proposals from leading engineering firms with the expertise required to design what is expected to be the largest single gold mine in the United States. A prime contractor is expected to be selected in the first quarter of 2026. In parallel, requests for proposals have been issued for specialist contractors covering the power plant, pipeline, and pressure oxidation and oxygen plant scopes of work, which will be incorporated into the BFS. Upon completion of the contractor selection process, a detailed timeline and budget for completion of the BFS will be established. Final construction approvals remain subject to completion of the environmental review, permitting, and the BFS.

The company has more than 120 years of history in lighting, under parent company Signify, formerly Philips Lighting and Philips. Now, Genlyte is the maker of a wide scope of professional lighting—from office and retail projects to Broadway shows to illuminating monumental landmarks.

Kevin Poyck, president and CEO of the Bridgewater, New Jersey-based unit spoke with Chief Executive to share the company’s roots and its strategy for moving forward.

Tell us about Signify’s Genlyte Solutions business, your history and how the company has grown.

Genlyte Solutions, a Signify business, has a 120-plus year legacy of lighting innovation and manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada, as well as Mexico and Central America. We are committed to unlocking the extraordinary potential of light for professional customers in the region.

Our collection of cutting-edge indoor and outdoor luminaires, LED lamps and electronics, and connected lighting systems and controls are designed to enhance well-being and performance, elevate experiences and advance sustainability—supporting brighter lives and a better world.

Among our trusted brands are Color Kinetics, which illuminates prominent buildings, bridges and landmarks; Vari-Lite, which lights concert tours, theater productions and large-scale entertainment events; and Philips, known for its high-quality and energy-efficient LED lamps.

To offer a bit of history: Signify is the world leader in lighting for professional and consumer customers. The company, founded as Philips in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, has led the lighting industry since 1891. Following the separation from Philips in 2016, we are now known as Signify.

Genlyte is a professional lighting business, focused on the North American market. Genlyte is fully responsible for its end-to-end processes including offer development, manufacturing, sales and marketing. The Genlyte name is not new to the company or lighting and electrical industries. Many of our luminaire brands come from Philips’ acquisition of Genlyte Group in 2008.

Over the last two years, our focus has been on distinguishing the Genlyte business and re-establishing our brands’ identities in the market given their strong legacies. We continue to strengthen our selling partnerships and invest, for example, in our digital capabilities, so we can best support our customers—along every stage of their project.

What do your U.S. manufacturing operations look like?

Genlyte operates three manufacturing facilities: two in Pennsylvania—a factory in Littlestown and a foundry in New Oxford—as well as a factory in Dallas, Texas.

Our Littlestown facility is best known for its production of our Hadco urban outdoor and landscape lighting solutions. We also manufacture at this site a robust portfolio of indoor and outdoor lighting products that meet domestic preference requirements, in line with the Build America, Buy America Act and Buy American Act.

In addition, Littlestown has become the manufacturing hub of our 3D printed lighting portfolio, encompassing decorative pendants, high and low bays, tracks and downlight accessories veracious under Genlyte’s Lightolier and Day-Brite CFI brands.

3D printing, as a manufacturing method, offers numerous benefits. The technology gives our customers the freedom to create their own unique designs, whether to suit a specific brand experience or space, in a timely and cost-effective manner. It supports a circular economy and sustainability; we use recyclable and bio-based materials and even waste like fishing nets.

Compared to traditional luminaires, 3D printed lighting fixtures don’t use paint or glue, and require fewer parts and screws, so they can be easily disassembled for reuse. Plus, they are produced on demand, reducing lead times, limiting waste and preventing large stock storage.

In our Dallas facility, we design and manufacture our Vari-Lite moving lights for the entertainment industry, along with control and power systems for theatres. These products make their way to Broadway productions, school and university theaters, and on tour with global artists.

Our people are at the heart of our U.S., and entire North America, manufacturing operations. Their health and well-being are our top priorities; we have strong programs in place to drive a safety culture. We invest in continuous learning and development, as well, so we build on our strong legacy while leading, challenging and shaping the future—for our business, Signify, the industry and the world we live in.

How about your operations in Canada and elsewhere?

Genlyte operates two manufacturing facilities in Canada: in Boisbriand, Quebec, home to our Lumec outdoor lighting brand; and in Langley, British Colombia, home to our Ledalite indoor architectural lighting brand. Both surpassed milestone anniversaries—50 and 40 years, respectively.

We also have two manufacturing facilities in Mexico—in Camargo, Chihuahua and in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon—as well as a robust regional distribution center network across North America with ready-made lighting stock available.

There are several other foundational elements to our manufacturing operations, one being our lean capabilities. Our sites are constantly on the lookout for opportunities to improve the level of quality and service we are delivering to our customers. So much so, Signify hosts an annual, global competition in which teams share their lean best practices and encourage replication throughout the entire company.

Another is sustainability. Our sustainable operations program focuses on reducing our carbon footprint. We employ energy-efficiency measures, including using 100 percent renewable energy. We also strive to minimize the amount of manufacturing waste that ends up in landfills; we achieved our commitment of sending zero waste to landfill at the end of 2024. We also engage with our suppliers and logistics and transport partners to drive their own emissions reductions.

How do you navigate a U.S.-Canada-Mexico business given today’s trade challenges?

It has never been more important to ensure that you have several contingency plans in place and to build a diversified footprint. With Signify being a global company, Genlyte has the benefit of using this reach to our advantage.

These steps have enabled us to adapt to the changing trade environment and mitigate short-term impacts as much as possible. We have, and continue to, assess developments as they unfold, while remaining focused on delivering for our customers and staying in close communication with them.

What’s next for Genlyte?

Lighting is an industry in the fast lane. It’s going through several different waves of transformation concurrently, which is exciting for our business.

The first is the shift to LED. While virtually every new construction project incorporates LED lighting and controls, there is still a big opportunity to upgrade existing buildings to high-performance technologies. Genlyte continues to bring new, ultra-efficient LED products to the market, to help our customers realize greater energy savings and quicker ROI.

Connected lighting systems, complemented with tailored lighting services, is a growing business. This can enable cities and businesses to realize even greater efficiency and value, with precise control over their lighting assets and energy use and the ability to extract actionable insights—whether for driving operational efficiency or supporting the well-being and performance of citizens or building occupants.

And now we are seeing another transition, harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. It is being applied to speed up lighting design processes and support customers’ product searches and quoting, so we can efficiently manufacture and deliver their projects.

Genlyte is committed to supporting our customers, no matter what “wave” they’re at. Our strategy focuses on delivering exceptional service, making it easy for them to get the custom lighting solutions they need, when they need it. The future looks bright and connected.",https://chiefexecutive.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kevin-Poyck-1.webp,N,,2026-01-09 14:02:31.247915

One could’ve easily sold bred heifers and replaced with the 5-year-old breds, selling $160 value into the market and getting paid $1,100 for it.","The top consultants in our industry have told me the reason my schools are the best is because I have chosen my “therapy” over everything else. What they mean is there is enough demand for me to do a school every month somewhere, but I have chosen to stay home to raise cattle and execute sell/buy trades earning money the same way I have for nearly 30 years. I enjoy the day-to-day tasks and going to auctions, which is now a welcome break from everything else in my life, which is why they now call it therapy.

I wasn’t in a good head space yesterday and must have felt I needed more time in my session. Despite the wind and the rain, I sat on the fence at the sale barn I was at and watched the sale barn cowboys load out trucks. Two things came to me.

I realized no one can criticize anything I do there. Sure, some will try, and quickly get put in their place. Thing is they have no clue what my numbers are telling me. Some have tried to lay claim to my success. They have no right since they didn’t have any skin in anything I’ve done. I also have no one to blame but myself. My only restraint is my numbers, and that is only because I am committed to making prosperous trades.

Some people don’t like auctions referring to it as a snake pit. My previous paragraph almost makes it sound like a safe space. Self-reflection is becoming a big thing for me. I’ve learned how things work and my perception is different.

My second thought was I should be used to being copied and maybe I should be flattered. Truth is it still makes me cringe, because no one respects a coat tail rider. If some in ag media, or even the education space, were sitting where I was on that fence in the rain with manure on their boots, they might be able to come up with their own original material, instead of relying on me.

Livestock haulers essential despite media calls for restrictions

Some in ag media have shared with me they think livestock haulers should have more restrictions and requirements. I will not hesitate to snap back at them they have no clue what they just said because it would crash our whole system.

I’ll save my rant, but here’s where I am going with this. If these people got their wish bull haulers would quit. Then what? Markets wouldn’t exist if we didn’t have a way to quickly transport the stock.

I think it makes sense that we need to support these people who haul livestock, instead of making things more difficult for them. The size and location of the operation doesn’t matter for this subject. At some point after the animal is sold it will take the ten-lug ride. Commerce in this industry has always been dependent on wheels. It used to be steel wheels under trains, now its 22 tires.

Weight gain business signals clear through feeder auction results

Feeder auctions sent the crystal-clear signal this is a weight gain business. Early in the week there was a leapfrog between five and six weight steers, but later in the week that got covered up.

This week feeder bulls were up to 70 back, and unweaned calves were up to 20 back. Replacement quality heifers caught a 20-dollar premium, and load lots caught one of 10 in places.

Geographical spreads were huge this week. Comparing certain weights against each other it could easily double the return on the gain, compared to buying close to home. Good thing the bull haulers don’t have all those restrictions to make this trade possible and keep the market afloat in those other states.

Cattle quality determines market success over breeder preferences

The last couple weeks I have witnessed people get upset their cattle didn’t sell well. We must sell something other people want to buy for it to sell well. A couple weeks ago I was the co bidder on some black hided, smooth headed steers that came out of a bucking stock program. These sold right at the top of the market. Time and time again, clubbie influenced cattle struggle to reach half the price the plain cattle sell for, with some not even getting a bid and being passed out as no value. If we are going to throw a fit about this on sale day remember that when ordering the straws this spring.

Breeding stock is the same way. No one wants thin cows, or small heifers. Some buyers will flat ignore certain consignments because of what they are bred to. What breed the female is will also matter to some buyers.

Female cattle depreciation patterns contradict popular industry advice

The female sale I kept tabs on looked like this. Bred heifers were the bellringers of bred stock. There was a $600 price drop for 3-4-year-olds. Then another price drop of $500 for 5-7-year-olds. Then any cow older than that was only $100 back from 5-7’s. Look where the depreciation actually happened.

The only pairs in the offering were in that 5-7-year-old range. They were over-valued to bred cows of the same age, and if the cow was bred back the 3 in 1 was worth $450 more.

Real market experience beats theoretical education and podcasting

We hear noise about deflecting depreciation and capturing appreciation. Again, these people should’ve been sitting where I was. The only two trades that work against open heifers were to sell the pairs, or bred heifers, and replace with opens.

One could’ve easily sold bred heifers and replaced with the 5-year-old breds, selling $160 value into the market and getting paid $1,100 for it. This is a better trade than swapping out for open heifers, especially since there was $1,500 value capture for having the calf at side, which gives us time value of money as well!

The previous paragraph just told readers about another great trade, 5-7-year-old pairs to breds of the same age. This sells $400 value into the market while getting paid almost $1,500 for it.

Isn’t that something, the cow the educators and podcasters tell us to sell was the best buy.

The view from the seats and drover’s alley is different and offers clarity. Now the joke is these sessions do not require insurance and are free, until we buy something.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt2e0568960277f8ae/69610c3c26eb620516aab1a0/Doug_Fergusonbeef_column.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-09 10:01:35.863535

Also, be sure to check out our list of the best CES tech we saw this year at the show.

Dreame Cyber X robot vacuum

Robot vacuums can be a little unsettling already, but Dreame’s Cyber X takes it up a level by sprouting chunky treaded “legs” and hauling itself up a full staircase like a tiny cleaning tank. In person, it navigated both up and down with surprising confidence, using its treads horizontally rather than actually stepping. The vacuum itself docks inside the climbing rig, so it’s more about getting your bot to the next floor than scrubbing the stairs, which still feels like a fair trade if you hate hauling appliances around.

OlloBot

CES loves a companion robot, but OlloBot might be the first one we’ve met that’s part cyber pet, part penguin, part ET and somehow comes with a warm, furry, telescoping neck. Its “face” is basically a tablet for expressions, photos and messages, and it’s meant to evolve a personality over time based on how your household interacts with it. Bonus: its memories live in a removable heart-shaped module, so if the body breaks, you can (theoretically) transplant your robot’s soul into a new shell.

ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo

Dual screens on a laptop aren’t new, but ASUS cramming two 16-inch OLED panels into a gaming notebook is the kind of chaotic CES energy we respect. The Zephyrus Duo uses a detachable keyboard and a built-in kickstand so you can stack screens, spread out, or generally arrange your portable battle station however you like. It’s hefty, it’s ambitious and it almost certainly won’t be cheap — but if you’ve ever wanted your gaming rig to moonlight as a two-screen creator setup, this is the loudest possible way to do it.

Throne toilet computer

Throne is a toilet-mounted computer that uses cameras and microphones to analyze your bowel movements, which is a sentence we did not expect to type this week. Designed to establish a personal “baseline” for your bathroom habits, it aims to flag changes that could indicate digestive or metabolic issues, including for people on GLP-1 drugs. We can’t speak to its effectiveness yet… but if knowledge is power, this thing might know way too much.

Vivoo Hygienic FlowPad smart menstrual pad

Vivoo looked at at-home health tracking and decided the bathroom was still underutilized. Alongside its clip-on smart toilet that analyzes your hydration by literally monitoring your pee, the company also unveiled a menstrual pad infused with microfluidics that can track fertility and hormone markers once you scan it with your phone. It’s a bold reminder that CES 2026 is fully committed to quantifying everything — even the stuff we’d rather not discuss over brunch.

Lenovo Legion Pro Rollable

Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable is what happens when a gaming laptop decides it wants to be a widescreen monitor mid-match. Its 16-inch display can physically expand sideways into ultra-wide formats, turning flight sims and racing games into full cockpit experiences at the press of a couple of keys. It’s impractical, faintly ridiculous and absolutely the kind of CES concept we hope survives long enough to escape the demo floor.

Lenovo ThinkBook XD Rollable

If the Legion Pro Rollable is excessive, the ThinkBook XD Rollable is philosophically confusing. Its flexible display doesn’t just grow taller, it wraps over the lid to create a “world-facing” screen for people sitting across from you, which feels either futuristic or deeply unnecessary depending on your mood and situation (maybe this is the perfect device for hotel check-ins and other points of sale?). Still, it’s a gorgeous piece of hardware theater and proof Lenovo is determined to roll screens onto every surface it can reach.

OhDoki Handy 2 Pro

OhDoki’s Handy 2 Pro arrived at CES with one clear message: more power, fewer limits and absolutely no chill. The upgraded sex toy model cranks battery life up to five hours and unlocks a Turbo mode so aggressive it was described as “overclocked,” which is not a term we expected to hear in this category. It can also charge your phone, because apparently even pleasure tech needs to justify itself with productivity.

iPolish

iPolish finally made Total Recall nail tech real, minus the dystopia and Schwarzenegger. These press-on acrylic nails use an electric charge to switch between hundreds of colors in seconds, letting you change your manicure as often as your outfit. It’s delightfully impractical, surprisingly affordable and the most convincing argument yet for treating your nails like a customizable display.

Hisense S6 FollowMe display

Despite the name, Hisense’s FollowMe doesn’t actually follow you at all. It’s a 32-inch 4K smart display on wheels that you manually drag from room to room, delivering strong TV-and-VCR-on-a-cart energy, just with Wi-Fi 6, a built-in camera, far-field mics and a 10-hour battery. It won’t judge you, chase you or demand attention, which might make it one of the least emotionally exhausting smart displays at CES.

GE Profile Smart Fridge

If you’ve ever bought a “just in case” bag of spinach and discovered three more at home, GE’s latest smart fridge wants to be your grocery reality check. A camera in the crisper records what’s inside, while a built-in barcode scanner in the water dispenser can add items to your shopping list with a quick wave, no app fumbling required. The AI bits are mostly there to answer practical questions like “Where’s my water filter?” which is the most convincing argument we’ve heard for putting a voice assistant on a fridge.

The Big Question What is your go-to escapist car film/book/tv show?","The confluence of politics and cars has been a little exhausting lately. Honestly, the confluence of politics with everything is overwhelming what few circuitbreakers I have left in my psyche. That’s why I’m glad that, today of all days, the car news is a little slow and boring, so I can provide a little bit of good news.

A new Jackass movie is coming this summer! Johnny Knoxville, Wee Man, and… other people, I’m sure, will be back. It’s been far too long, and while I don’t think it’ll mend all of America’s tears, maybe it’ll distract us long enough to remember we’re all part of the same fabric. And also, it’s fun to watch people do dumb things with cars.

Because CES is going on, there’s still a lot of talk about self-driving, and Ford’s made a kind of surprising announcement. Lucid and Uber made an announcement, but I’m less surprised by it, as it seems obvious.

And, finally, Volvo has a car that plans to fight range anxiety.

Who Is Ready For Jackass This Summer?

A post shared by Johnny Knoxville (@johnnyknoxville)

We did three film festivals at Jalopnik, and the last one was the biggest and also my least favorite. It got too big because we got more than a million dollars for it, and the more money you take, the more you gotta do. It had some great moments, including showing the documentary about car culture in Cuba, Havana Motor Club (a couple of participants in the film were on hand and may have done some hilarious thing with a reader’s AMG wagon…).

In retrospect, the film order was all wrong. We started the day with Mad Max and then transitioned into Being Evel, the Johnny Knoxville-helmed doc about Evel Knievel, finishing with our big “get,” which was the North American premiere of Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans. This was a doc about the making of the Le Mans film and, like the film it’s based on, it was good, not great.

I hadn’t even seen Being Evel; it was just available, so we tossed it in the lineup. My bad! It’s fantastic. As someone who has made a couple of documentaries since, I’m overwhelmed by the thoughtfulness. The McQueen documentary has a hard time resolving the fact that its subject was a deeply flawed person, clearly fearful that it would make the project itself not worth making if it fully acknowledged McQueen’s behavior. Hagiography is a bit like gastroenterology in that they’re both primarily consumed with making difficult shit disappear.

Being Evel directly confronts the person of Evel Knievel and doesn’t pull any punches, which somehow doesn’t make you care less about his accomplishments.

This is all to say that I think if you look with any scrutiny at Johnny Knoxville’s body of work, the most consistent feature is a remarkable consciousness. A large percentage of his oeuvre is dedicated to people getting hit in the nuts or turning their pink torpedoes into beehives or whatever, but none of it feels like punching down. That seems impossible.

The last Jackass project was in 2022, with the film Jackass Forever. Not everyone from the original MTV prank show was there for reasons both tragic and litigious, but it felt like it came at exactly the right time. According to a new post from Johnny Knoxville, a new Jackass film is coming this summer.

Given everything else in the world, I think a few of us might need this. Watching someone fired like a projectile out of a piece of artillery or slammed in the nards with a pumelo isn’t going to fix everything, or anything, but I welcome the distraction.

Just leave the poor Ford Contours alone!

Ford Thinks It’s Going To Catch Up To GM’s Eye-Free Driving With Its Cheapest EV

Ok, this one got me. In the self-driving space, we’ve been sort of stuck at Level 2, so people keep inventing their own SAE labels like “Level 2++” or FSD. Essentially, no one is willing to commit to Level 3 because, seemingly, the handoff between driver and passenger feels harder at 75 mph if the driver is, say, asleep.

Mercedes announced its FSD-like Level 2 system this week, and GM has said it’ll bring “eyes-off driving” to the super expensive Cadillac Escalade IQ for highways in 2028. Ford said it’ll match its crosstown rival with Level 2 in 2027 on its cheapest vehicle and then L3 in 2028.

Doug Field, the company’s head of all things technological and EV, said this:

Autonomy shouldn’t be a premium feature. By designing our own software and hardware in-house, we’ve found a way to make this technology more affordable. This means we can put advanced hands-free driving into the vehicles people actually buy, not just vehicles with unattainable price points. With 1.2 million BlueCruise-equipped vehicles already on the road, we are able to learn from real-world miles to continuously improve the experience for our customers.

Just as important, we’re focused on efficiency — delivering more capability, not just sheer processing power. Because we own the technology behind our driver assistance systems, we can deliver significantly more capability at a 30% lower cost than if we bought it from outside suppliers, which makes advanced driver assistance scalable.

We plan to introduce new hardware and software, thanks to our in-house teams, starting in 2027 on our all-new, affordable Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform. And we aren’t stopping at hands-free driving; building on this same flexible foundation, L3 eyes-off driving will be road ready in 2028, making the ultimate in-vehicle experience available for the many, not just a privileged few

It sounds like, then, Ford and GM will debut systems at roughly the same time, but the difference is that it’ll be on Ford’s Skunkworks truck or other cheap EV, and for GM, it’ll start out on the Escalade IQ.

Uber And Lucid Are Doing A Thing

It’s been clear for a long time that Uber’s long-term goal is to get rid of drivers, although the path to this has been rocky. Uber initially partnered with Volvo on a self driving program that resulted in the first self-driving fatality.

Uber is trying again in the United States, this time with a robotaxi based on the Lucid Gravity. That car is arguably the best three-row anything for sale right now, so that’s not a bad place to start. How big the market is for three-row EVs remains to be seen, but this seems like a good use of the company’s growing production capacity.

The company says the taxis are already testing in San Francisco, and a production-intent version will go into production later this year, featuring tech from Nuro.

From Lucid:

“The debut of our production intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale,” said Dave Ferguson, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Nuro. “By bringing together Nuro’s proven level 4 autonomy, Lucid’s advanced vehicle architecture, and Uber’s global reach, we’re building a robotaxi service designed for real-world operations and long-term growth.”

“Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year,” said Sarfraz Maredia, Global Head of Autonomous Mobility & Delivery at Uber. “By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy, and ridehailing, we’re building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond.”

As with Waymo, but unlike Tesla, this system uses Lidar.

The Volvo EX60 Gets 400 Miles Of Range

A new Volvo compact crossover EV is coming in the form of the Volvo EX60. The company is very excited about the 400 miles of range and charging time:

“The EX60 is designed to be a gamechanger,” says Anders Bell, Chief Technology Officer at Volvo Cars. “With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety.”

The EX60 does not only boast the longest range of any fully electric Volvo, it also charges faster than any electric Volvo before in all weather conditions. Instead of a full lunch break, a quick coffee stop is now enough to recharge the battery and hit the road again.

Fun fact, when someone says something is going to be a “gamechanger” it is not going to change any games. It used to be that 300 miles was the gold standard of EVs, but for luxury EVs, I think it’s probably been surpassed. 400 is the new 300, you heard it here first.

Delta Earnings On Deck.","HARRISON MILLER, Investor's Business Daily",,,,,https://www.investors.com/news/southwest-airlines-luv-stock-double-upgrade-q4-airline-earnings-outlook/,"Southwest Airlines broke out early Friday after receiving a double upgrade from JPMorgan.
Multiple analysts have raised their price targets on shares this week as Delta (DAL) kicks off earnings for airline stocks early next week.
JPMorgan on Friday upgraded Southwest Airlines (LUV) to overweight from underweight and hiked its price target on LUV stock to 60 from 36, The Fly reported.
Southwest Stock Southwest shares surged 4.4% Friday to break out above a 43.54 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.
Delta stock gained 1.6% Friday.","Southwest Airlines broke out early Friday after receiving a double upgrade from JPMorgan. Multiple analysts have raised their price targets on shares this week as Delta (DAL) kicks off earnings for airline stocks early next week. Other airline stocks rose early Friday.

JPMorgan on Friday upgraded Southwest Airlines (LUV) to overweight from underweight and hiked its price target on LUV stock to 60 from 36, The Fly reported. The firm said that the potential for a $5 earnings-per-share outlook for 2026 is ""attractively probable,"" and such a guidance would ""handily dwarf"" the $2.98 consensus estimate. It added that Southwest's core business was starting to stabilize and its initiatives, such as bag fees and seat assignments, are progressing.

Southwest reports its results on Jan. 29. FactSet expects Southwest to report a 1 cent increase in earnings to 57 cents per share on 5% decline in revenue.

The double upgrade comes after Morgan Stanley on Thursday raised its price target on Southwest from 48 to 50. The report noted that airlines have sounded very positive about underlying demand trends. However, Q4 will likely be ""another noisy quarter"" to cap off a ""write-off year"" for airlines. Still, the ""tone may be different"" despite the noise. The firm kept an overweight rating on LUV stock.

UBS on Tuesday said that the setup heading into earnings season appears favorable. The firm expects bullish outlooks for Q1 and 2026, driven by rebounding demand, modest Q1 capacity growth, easing fuel prices and easier demand comparisons starting in February.

UBS raised its price target on LUV stock to 45 from 43 and kept a neutral rating on the shares.

Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines reports Q4 results on Tuesday. FactSet analysts expect earnings will fall 17% to $1.53 per share on 4% revenue growth to $14.7 billion.

Delta in its Q3 report said it expects earnings to range from $1.60 to $1.90 per share on 2% to 4% revenue growth. CEO Ed Bastian in October said that Q4 could potentially be ""the best fourth-quarter performance in our history.""

Southwest Stock

Southwest shares surged 4.4% Friday to break out above a 43.54 buy point in a four-weeks-tight pattern.

The four-weeks-tight pattern, a follow-on buying opportunity, took shape after Southwest broke out of a six-month cup base in early December.

Southwest stock is trading near its highest price since June 2022.

American Airlines (AAL) swung 3.5% higher Friday morning. United Airlines (UAL) rose more than 2% to advance out of a buy zone.

Delta stock gained 1.6% Friday.

At CES 2026, HP Inc. is highlighting its growing problems, which are being faced by professionals worldwide: workplace stress and low job satisfaction. As per HP’s research, only 20 per cent of knowledge workers currently have a healthy relationship with work. The company believes this can change with the right mix of AI-driven tools, flexible devices and employee-first technology. When companies invest in modern technology, employee satisfaction and productivity rise significantly — a message that strongly resonates with India’s rapidly growing hybrid workforce.

HP has rolled out a bunch of new devices and platforms aimed at making hybrid work, creativity, and business growth a little easier.

1. HP EliteBoard G1a

Let’s start with the HP EliteBoard G1a. It’s the first full AI PC hidden right inside a keyboard. You just pick it up, drop it into any workspace, and you’ve got serious computing power in something that barely takes up space. The thing even snagged a CES 2026 Innovation Award.

2. HP EliteBook X G2 Series

These are high-end business laptops built for the age of AI. They’re made for folks who want performance, tight security, and smart features all in one slim package.

3. OmniBook Ultra 14 and OmniStudioX

On the consumer side, HP gave its OmniBook lineup a refresh. The new OmniBook Ultra 14 and OmniStudioX promise faster speeds, sharper video, and smarter AI tools—great for everyday users and creators who want something extra.

4. HP Printer with Microsoft 365 Copilot

Printing gets a big upgrade, too. HP became the first to bake Microsoft Copilot right into its office printers. With HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot, you can summarise documents, translate, and organise files straight from the printer. That’s a real time-saver, especially for busy offices and small businesses in India.

5. Workforce Experience Platform (WXP)

For IT teams, HP improved its Workforce Experience Platform (WXP). Managing devices, keeping business running smoothly, and supporting remote work just got a lot simpler.

6. HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M

HP also introduced some new accessories, all designed with comfort and sustainability in mind. Think: the HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M (now in pink for a little flair), a compact 65W USB-C GaN charger, and protective laptop sleeves built to last.

7. OMEN and HyperX

Gamers, you’re not left out. OMEN and HyperX are now unified under the HyperX brand, and there’s the new HyperX OMEN MAX 16. HP calls it the world’s most powerful gaming laptop, complete with all-internal cooling.

8. HP Digital Passport

Another highlight is the HP Digital Passport. This platform, which also won a CES 2026 Innovation Award, gives you everything you need to know about your device—from features and sustainability details to support—all in one spot.

9. HP’s Future of Work Accelerator

And one thing to look ahead to is the HP Future of Work Accelerator, which is going to take place in 2026. It will offer funding, hardware and mentorship to organisations working in AI and workforce development.

Pour UBS, les ""étoiles s'alignent' pour L'Oréal, quand JPMorgan a intégré l'action dans sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"".

L'Oréal bondit à la Bourse de Paris vendredi, à la faveur d'un relèvement de recommandation par UBS, qui identifie une combinaison rare de facteurs bénéficiant au géant français des cosmétiques, tandis que JPMorgan l'a inscrit sur sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"" à l’approche des résultats de février.

Vers 12h, le titre gagne 4,4% à 380,30 euros tandis que son indice de référence, le CAC40 montant de 0,70% au même moment.

Dans une note publiée jeudi, UBS souligne que ""les étoiles s’alignent"" pour L’Oréal, le groupe étant porté par l’accélération du secteur et des gains de parts de marché, une valorisation jugée ""attrayante"" ainsi qu’un profil de risque amélioré.

Le courtier, qui relève sa recommandation à ""acheter"" contre ""neutre"", anticipe désormais une croissance organique de 6,4% au quatrième trimestre 2025, contre un consensus à 6,1%, et de 5,8% en 2026.

""Nous nous attendons à ce que L’Oréal indique une nouvelle année de surperformance par rapport à l’industrie de la beauté et de progrès supplémentaires en matière de rentabilité"", ajoute UBS.

""Positive Catalyst Watch""

En parallèle, JPMorgan a placé le groupe sur sa liste ""Positive Catalyst Watch"".

Selon le courtier, les commentaires optimistes sur l’amélioration aux États-Unis et la reprise progressive en Chine donnés en décembre lors d'une journée des investisseurs, ainsi que les données récentes, devraient rassurer sur l’accélération de la ?croissance organique sous-jacente des ventes.

""La dynamique du chiffre d’affaires à court terme devrait être rassurante, avec un bon point de sortie vers 2025 et une poursuite probable de la dynamique au premier ?trimestre, ce qui pourrait renforcer la confiance pour 2026"", ajoute-t-il.

JPMorgan indique toutefois s’attendre à une croissance organique limitée à 4,4% en 2026, en dessous du consensus (+5%), en raison du ralentissement en Europe occidentale et d’une accélération séquentielle limitée en Chine.

Une ""surprise positive"" à court terme serait bien accueillie par le marché, souligne le courtier, mais une revalorisation durable du titre nécessiterait une surperformance plus marquée, ajoute-t-il cependant.

Additional content: Is BigBear.ai a NVIDIA-like AI Stock and Top 2026 Buy?
Currently, BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
Zacks Investment Research does not engage in investment banking, market making or asset management activities of any securities.","Our estimates for Mounjaro and Zepbound suggest a CAGR of 44.6% and 73.7%, respectively, over the next three years. Meanwhile, in addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly is investing broadly in obesity and has several new molecules currently in clinical development with a range of oral and injectable medications with different mechanisms of action.

Lilly Inks Obesity Drug Deal with Trump Administration

LLY has inked a deal with the Trump Administration to provide wider access to obesity drugs through the ""TrumpRX"" platform. The new ""BALANCE"" program will allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover GLP-1s for obesity with lower co-pays ($50/month) starting in 2027. These incentives should help to drive hot obesity drug sales even further.

New Drugs, Future Pipeline will Continue to Drive Growth

In addition to Mounjaro and Zepbound, Lilly has received approvals for other new drugs in the past couple of years. Omvoh/mirikizumab was approved for its first inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) indication, ulcerative colitis, in the United States, Europe and Japan in 2023 and for its second IBD condition, Crohn's disease, in the United States, Europe, and Japan in 2025. Additionally, Lilly has been building its pipeline and has a wide range of compounds in various stages of development.

Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates expect robust EPS growth of 41.24% in 2026. LLY, which recently crossed the $1 trillion market cap landmark, will continue to attract institutional investors, as the company has the rare and coveted combination of rapid growth and underlying liquidity.

LLY Bounces off the Rising 10-Week MA

Beyond fundamentals, LLY's price action is also bullish. LLY shares are bouncing off the rising 10-week moving average for the first time since breaking out in late 2025, offering investors a high reward-to-risk entry point.

Bottom Line

Eli Lilly has solidified its position as a global pharma titan. With leading drugs and a massive obesity market, Lilly is poised to be a juggernaut for years to come.

Bear of the Day:

Based in Beijing, Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock JD.com one of the largest Chinese e-commerce and technology companies. Also known as Jingdong, JD.com separates itself from the competition by being an essentially vertically integrated e-commerce retailer. JD holds its own inventory, is responsible for its own logistics and deliveries, and provides its own customer service.

JD is similar to Amazon in that it sells a wide variety of products on its e-commerce platform, including clothing, groceries, electronics, and more. Beyond e-commerce, JD also operates health, technology, real estate, and industrial segment businesses. Additionally, JD owns Ochama, a European-based retail brand with operations in the Netherlands France, and Poland.

JD Suffers from Relative Price Weakness Vs. Peers

Legendary growth investor William O'Neil once proclaimed that Wall Street's great paradox is, ""Stocks that seem too high in price and risky for most investors usually go higher and stocks that seem low and cheap often go lower."" I have largely discovered that more often than not, O'Neil's paradox comes to fruition. That's bad news for JD shares, which trade at $30 and are well off their all-time high of >$100.

Additionally, relative price action can provide investors with valuable clues. Currently, JD shares exhibit troubling relative weakness and are -15.02% over the past year, far underperforming top competitors like Pinduoduo and Alibabawhich are up 20.76% and 83.76% respectively.

JD: Slowing Sales Growth

JD sales growth is declining at an alarming rate. For the current quarter, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that earnings growth will be just 6.68%%. Meanwhile, Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest sluggish annual revenue growth of 5.22% in 2026.

JD Food Delivery Business is a Headwind

JD is making an aggressive play for the Chinese food delivery market. While the number of users for the company's Uber (UBER) Eats or DoorDash (DASH) like business has increased, the segment has produced significant losses thus far. Worse still, the company must invest significant capital to maintain its reputation for fast and reliable delivery in a highly competitive market.

Bottom Line

JD.com currently faces a difficult uphill battle. Between alarming slowdowns in growth and the financial strain of expansion into the competitive food delivery market, JD's ""cheap"" share price may be warranted.

Is BigBear.ai a NVIDIA-like AI Stock and Top 2026 Buy?

BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. has strengthened its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings and growth potential through a recent strategic acquisition and a robust cash position. However, a slowdown in revenue growth and rising losses raise questions about whether the stock is a buy now and whether it's too early to call it the next NVIDIA Corporation. Let's take a closer look.

Reasons to Be Bullish on BigBear.ai

BigBear.ai's recent $250 million acquisition of Ask Sage is expected to drive revenue growth by strengthening its footprint in national security, defense and intelligence markets. Ask Sage is a rapidly growing generative AI platform tailored for the defense industry and used by agencies, including Defense Health and the U.S. Space Force.

BigBear.ai's Ask Sage integration has added a secure generative AI workflow to its portfolio, enabling customers to deploy AI while preserving data sovereignty and security. Kevin McAleenan, CEO of BigBear.ai, added that ""Ask Sage is already operating at scale in mission-critical environments, and together we are bringing to market a secure, integrated AI platform that unifies data, software, and mission services in one place,"" as noted in the company's news release.

BigBear.ai's management is optimistic about future sales growth and has already raised full-year 2025 revenue guidance to between $125 million and $140 million, citing ir.bigbear.ai. Additionally, BigBear.ai's solid cash balance of $456.6 million as of Sept. 30, 2025, has provided the company with ample funds to support growth initiatives.

Is BBAI the Next NVIDIA-Like AI Stock & a Top Buy for 2026?

The Ask Sage acquisition, strong cash position and potential boost in government spending from President Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" could accelerate BigBear.ai's revenue growth. The company is also moving closer to profitability. It reported third-quarter 2025 net income of $2.5 million, in contrast to the net loss of $15.1 million a year ago, which may encourage stakeholders to hold onto the stock.

However, even if it's anticipated that BigBear.ai will experience an acceleration in revenue growth, its results show a deceleration. BigBear.ai's third-quarter 2025 revenues of $33.1 million fell 20% year over year, following second-quarter 2025 revenues of $32.5 million, which declined 18% year over year. Moreover, the company posted a third-quarter operating loss of $21.9 million, more than double the previous year's figure.

All these factors suggest that it may not be the ideal time for new entrants to place bets on BigBear.ai. Declining sales growth and rising operating losses could hinder the company's growth momentum, making it premature to label BigBear.ai as the ""next NVIDIA"" in the field of AI.

The Jensen Huang-led company, on the other hand, has been reporting consistent increases in quarterly revenues and earnings, banking on the incessant demand for their next-generation Blackwell chips and CUDA software platform (read more: Top 3 AI Stocks, Including NVIDIA to Buy Now for 2026 Growth).

Currently, BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

The rollout of OpenAI for Healthcare makes it clear the company is betting that health is going to be a big vertical. OpenAI is looking to make ChatGPT a key tool on both sides of the healthcare equation. Anthropic has also launched Claude for Life Sciences and has embedded its models into healthcare workflows. Both model providers will compete and partner with healthcare efforts from multiple software and cloud vendors.

ChatGPT for Healthcare is rolling out with some major customers. In a blog post, OpenAI said AdventHealth, Baylor Scott & White Health, Boston Children’s Hospital, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, HCA Healthcare, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Stanford Medicine Children’s Health and University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) will use ChatGPT for Healthcare.

OpenAI said healthcare providers have been tailoring OpenAI API to be HIPAA compliant. ChatGPT for Healthcare can help with serving up medical knowledge, admin work and personalize care. OpenAI provided sample prompts and use cases for ChatGPT for Healthcare.

ChatGPT for Healthcare includes:

GPT-5 models specifically built for healthcare and tested by physicians and benchmarked.

Citations for evidence retrieval to check sources.

Integrations with enterprise tools so healthcare providers align ChatGPT for Healthcare with policies, document repositories and best practices.

Templates for workflow automation for patient instructions, discharge summaries, clinical letters and authorizations.

Governance and access management based on roles.

HIPAA compliance. Content shared with ChatGPT for Healthcare isn't used to train models.

ChatGPT for Healthcare appears to have a better footing in the enterprise with big name customers already in the fold. It remains to be seen how ChatGPT Health fares with consumers.

Launched earlier this week to a small number of customers, ChatGPT Health is a dedicated experience where consumers can share medical records, data and wellness information. ChatGPT Health promises to keep conversations encrypted and isolated.

ChatGPT Health also integrates with Apple Health, Function and MyFitnessPal and will likely expand its roster of health apps in the future. OpenAI said that ChatGPT Health conversations won't flow over to regular chats. Ultimately, OpenAI sees ChatGPT Health as an advisor to prep consumers for doctor visits, improve nutrition and craft exercise programs. The service will even digest your lab results and point out what's important.

What could go wrong? Given that health is a primary use case for ChatGPT already, I didn't expect much wariness from health savvy consumers in my circle. Instead, the answers were unanimous with some form of ""hell no."" Biggest concern was sharing your data with OpenAI. Now this informal poll isn't scientific, but there will be some set of consumers that won't trust OpenAI's dedicated health service without some HIPAA-like promise.

Either way, ChatGPT for Healthcare may take care of patient usage. It'll just be a question of whether patients use OpenAI directly or indirectly.",https://www.constellationr.com/sites/default/files/styles/metatag/public/uploads/Screenshot%202026-01-09%20063242.png?itok=DLTJ05Da,N,,2026-01-09 08:01:56.950858

Significant Technical Reversal for L'Oréal

L'Oréal's stock marked an increase of 4.64% to 379.75 euros this Friday, January 9 at midday, up from a closing at 362.90 euros the previous day. This rise represents a significant technical reversal for the French cosmetics giant, as it now surpasses its key resistance level of 377.95 euros identified in previous days. The 50-day moving average, set at 365.21 euros, is also exceeded upwards, signaling a potential short-term trend change after several weeks of consolidation. This rebound occurs after Swiss bank UBS upgraded its recommendation from neutral to buy this morning, simultaneously raising its price target from 367 to 430 euros. UBS justifies this change by a significant improvement in the group's performance indicators, strengthened commercial dynamics in the United States and China, and reduced risks related to capital allocation. The bank anticipates a comparable sales growth of 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and 5.8% in 2026, above the consensus established at 6.1% and 5.1% respectively. JPMorgan has also added the stock to its list of securities offering the best short-term yield-risk ratio.

Technical Indicators and Valuation

The RSI, standing at 39, confirms that the stock had been moving in a technically neutral zone without signs of overbuying, leaving room for progression. The MACD trend indicator, although slightly negative with a MACD line at minus 0.68 point below the signal line at 0.63 point, does not prevent this vigorous rebound supported by a major fundamental catalyst. The moderate monthly volatility of 5.22% and an almost zero beta at 0.10 demonstrate a relatively decoupled evolution from the movements of the CAC 40, which enhances the interest in this independent movement of the stock. UBS highlights that the stock's valuation has become attractive again, with a ratio of 26.5 times the estimated earnings for 2026, a level 20% below its five-year average. The brokerage also praises the strategic decision of the group to limit its stake in Galderma to 20%, ending uncertainties over future capital allocation. Bernstein has also slightly lowered its price target from 410 to 405 euros while maintaining its market performance recommendation. The group will publish its annual 2025 results on February 12, a date that will focus investor attention following this bond issue of 1.75 billion euros carried out on January 7 to partly finance the acquisition of an additional 10% stake in Galderma.

To own Best Buy, you need to believe the company can offset pressures in lower margin electronics with healthier earnings from services, memberships and vendor support. The recent news about disciplined holiday promotions and a tilt toward higher margin offerings supports that thesis and may help the key short term catalyst of margin stability, but it does not remove the core risk that mix shifts, promotions and competition could still pressure gross profit.

Among recent announcements, the continued commitment to a US$0.95 quarterly dividend stands out in this context, because it highlights management’s focus on returning cash to shareholders while working through softer earnings and margin compression. For investors, this sits alongside the push into higher margin services as a key part of how Best Buy is trying to balance current profitability with future reinvestment, even as online competition and direct to consumer brands test the resilience of its store centric model.

Yet behind this push into services, investors should still be aware of the risk that heavier exposure to lower margin categories and intense promotions could...

Best Buy's narrative projects $44.5 billion revenue and $1.5 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 2.3% yearly revenue growth and roughly a $700 million earnings increase from $778.0 million today.

Uncover how Best Buy's forecasts yield a $83.57 fair value, a 21% upside to its current price.

Local AV specialist and PPDS partner Mansveld Techniek completed the installation in three weeks, ahead of the start of the 2025/26 Eredivisie season. The project requirements included high-quality performance, reliability, flexibility for various hosted events beyond football, and sustainability.

Sjors van den Boogaart, director of Philips Stadion, said: “After more than a decade of service, our displays have made way for the new LED walls in the Philips Stadion, delivering a huge leap in image quality and brightness, which perfectly aligns with our ambitions for innovation. Fans now experience sharper visuals, whilst installations continue to support dynamic and impactful content.”

That same intelligence now supports a broader set of fresh food decisions, giving grocery teams a shared view of what is happening today and what needs to happen next.","Food technology executive joins Afresh, following record 70% growth, to expand its AI platform across merchandising, operations, and supply chain organizations.

SAN FRANCISCO — Afresh announced the appointment of Adam Litle as Chief Revenue Officer, following the company’s biggest year to date, with more than 70% year-over-year topline growth and usage across more than 12,000 grocery departments in North America. The hire reflects Afresh’s focus on accelerating adoption of its AI platform across the grocery industry. Litle joins a leadership team with deep experience operating enterprise software companies through periods of rapid growth.

Over the past year, Afresh has expanded its platform with several of the largest grocery retailers in the U.S., including Albertsons, Wakefern, and Meijer. As adoption has grown, more merchandising, operations, and supply chain teams are relying on Afresh’s platform to run fresh food categories. With the launch of several new products in 2025—including Production Planning, Period Ending Inventory, Fresh Buying, and a major upgrade to its flagship Fresh Replenishment solution—the company is scaling to support continued growth across both U.S. and international markets.

Litle brings deep experience building and scaling technology companies in food, agriculture, and retail. He most recently served as CEO of Sound Agriculture and previously held the role of Chief Revenue Officer at Granular, where he helped grow the company from inception through its acquisition by Corteva—the second-largest agtech exit at the time. Earlier in his career, Litle led sales at Monetate, where he launched AI-driven personalization solutions for retail e-commerce, working closely with merchandising and digital teams. At Afresh, Litle will lead go-to-market strategy as the company expands how grocery teams use AI to plan, buy, and operate fresh food categories every day.

“What stood out to me about Afresh wasn’t just its leadership in fresh—it was the potential for it to expand its AI platform to all aspects of the food supply chain,” said Litle. “The company was built to tackle the staggering reality that 30-40% of global food production is wasted. Afresh applies cutting-edge AI to manage thousands of variables that impact buying, ordering, and inventory decisions for produce, meat, seafood, deli, and baked goods. The opportunity for Afresh’s technology to help optimize decisions across grocery and food distribution, all the way back to the farm, is massive.”

From the beginning, Afresh has focused on solving the operational complexity of fresh food at scale. The company first demonstrated this approach in fresh replenishment, where accurate ordering requires accounting for daily shifts in demand and supply. That same intelligence now supports a broader set of fresh food decisions, giving grocery teams a shared view of what is happening today and what needs to happen next.

“Afresh is at a pivotal moment as grocery teams face more volatility—and pressure to get decisions right—than ever before,” said Matt Schwartz, CEO and co-founder of Afresh. “Adam has spent his career helping food and agtech companies turn complex technology into real customer value. His experience scaling organizations in dynamic environments will be critical as we build on our momentum and expand Afresh’s impact across the industry.”",https://perishablenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/B_Afresh.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 16:01:45.410939

Dior’s next retail opening in Asia centers on landscape as much as fashion. When the Dior Bamboo Pavilion opens on February 12 in Tokyo’s Daikanyama district, the House will introduce a temporary structure shaped by vegetation, architectural craft, and long-standing cultural ties between France and Japan. The Pavilion continues Dior’s recent series of experiential retail projects in cities including Bangkok and Seoul, while placing an unusually strong emphasis on gardens and plant life as organizing principles.

The exterior draws on Dior’s historic flagship at 30 Avenue Montaigne, incorporating recognizable house motifs such as the star Christian Dior regarded as his good luck charm. In Tokyo, those references take the form of a golden, bamboo-inspired facade, aligning the structure with the surrounding neighborhood. Daikanyama’s residential character, marked by small shops, cafes, and independent galleries, provides a subdued setting for the Pavilion’s architectural presence.

A garden as the pavilion’s core

Vegetation shapes the Pavilion from the inside out. The indoor green space conceived by floral artist Azuma Makoto forms the spatial center of the project, spanning more than 19,000 square feet. Makoto’s work for Dior has previously translated botanical forms into sculptural installations; in Tokyo, the scale expands to create an immersive environment that moves through layered plantings and architectural framing. The installation reflects Christian Dior’s documented fascination with gardens and their influence on his approach to color, silhouette, and composition.

Additional landscape elements extend throughout the Pavilion. A Zen garden designed by landscape designer Seijun Nishihata introduces a contemplative rhythm to the space, while a terrace and a pond populated with koi carp rendered in luminous glass introduce water and light as design elements.

The emphasis on gardens aligns the Pavilion with broader developments in luxury retail design, where biophilic environments have become increasingly common. Dior’s approach distinguishes itself through scale and integration, with vegetation shaping circulation, sightlines, and the pacing of the retail experience.

Fashion, craft, and cultural continuity

Within this landscaped setting, Dior will present women’s and men’s collections designed by creative director Jonathan Anderson, including ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories, and jewelry. A dedicated room for the customization of Lady Dior and Book Tote bags introduces a focused area for bespoke interaction, consistent with the Pavilion’s attention to craftsmanship.

Interior finishes combine established Dior codes with Japanese materials and techniques. Versailles parquet flooring appears alongside ceilings and walls finished in washi paper, while lanterns modeled after the Lady Dior bag punctuate the space. The Pavilion also includes works by contemporary designers and studios such as Takt Project, Sho Ota, Ayumi Shibata, We+, Hana Mitsui, and Chikaken, reinforcing connections to Tokyo’s design community.

The Pavilion will house Café Dior, featuring an exclusive menu developed by chef Anne-Sophie Pic, extending Dior’s ongoing collaboration with the Michelin-starred chef. The opening follows the launch of the Monsieur Dior restaurant in Beijing and reflects the House’s continued expansion into hospitality as part of its broader lifestyle strategy.",https://the-ethos.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/dior-garden.webp,N,,2026-01-09 10:13:23.834740

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-09 08:05:51+00:00,EE Times,Nvidia Bets Big on China with H200 Push - EE Times,"Pablo Valerio, Sunny Bains",,,,,https://www.eetimes.com/nvidia-bets-big-on-china-with-h200-push/,"This would require Chinese companies to buy a certain number of domestic chips, like Huawei’s Ascend series, with every Nvidia H200 order.
To make this work, Beijing has reportedly told tech companies to temporarily stop buying H200 chips.
Now, buyers must pay the full amount upfront for H200 orders, with no option to cancel or get a refund.
Even with these tough terms, Chinese companies are still eager to buy, underscoring their need for computing power to train large language models.
As TSMC increases production and the U.S. collects its fees, the movement of H200 chips will show where global tech separation is heading.","This week, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang appeared confident despite the complex geopolitical challenges facing the company.

Standing before a packed crowd, Huang confirmed the substantial Chinese demand for Nvidia’s advanced H200 artificial-intelligence processors. “We’ve fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,” he said Tuesday during a Q&A session. “We’re getting the last details of the licensing finished with the U.S. government.”

Despite Huang’s confident statements, Nvidia faces a complicated set of regulations that make selling these chips unusually difficult. The company has asked TSMC to increase production, but it must deal with two major challenges: a 25% tax from the U.S. government and a policy from Beijing that pushes customers to buy from local competitors.

Frenzy in the supply chain

Nvidia is acting quickly to capitalize on what it sees as a new opportunity. People familiar with the situation say the company has officially asked TSMC to make more H200 chips to meet rising demand from Chinese tech companies.

The data shows a significant demand for computing power. Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba have reportedly placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, with deliveries scheduled for this year. This demand is well above Nvidia’s current stock of about 700,000 units, so the company plans to start additional manufacturing runs in the second quarter of 2026.

Each chip costs about $27,000 and represents a significant improvement over earlier H20 processors sold in China. But delivering these orders is not just a matter of logistics—it also depends on political stability. As Huang said on Tuesday, “The future ships on schedule; the present ships when it’s allowed to.”

Washington’s price of admission

The resumption of high-end chip sales to China follows a chaotic period of policy shifts in Washington. The Biden administration had previously instituted a broad ban on advanced AI semiconductors to thwart China’s military modernization.

In a major change, President Donald Trump recently allowed the export of the H200 to “approved customers,” but added a new rule: 25% fee on sales revenue must go to the U.S. Treasury. To sell to China, Nvidia must first ship the chips to the U.S., pay the 25% as an import tax, undergo a “security inspection,” and then send the chips to Chinese customers.

Experts say this policy marks a shift from trying to contain China to making money from sales. It has sparked heated debate within the U.S. government. Senate Democrats and some national security advocates have called the decision “dangerous,” saying the H200—about six times more powerful than the previous model—will “turbocharge” China’s military capabilities. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, seven senators warned that the administration was sacrificing national security at risk for corporate profits.

“The President’s dangerous decision to give away critical national security controls represents a significant departure from longstanding bipartisan efforts to ensure that U.S. technology does not turbocharge China’s military and technological capabilities,” the senators wrote.

Even with presidential approval, shipments are still slowed by bureaucracy. Each export needs its own license, which can delay or stop shipments. Nvidia executives say the final details of the licensing process are still being worked out, so shipping dates remain uncertain.

Beijing’s “matchmaking” mandate

While Washington seeks to tax Nvidia’s entry, Beijing is maneuvering to limit it. The Chinese government is treating the H200 not just as a product but as a strategic lever to force domestic self-sufficiency.

According to Reuters, regulators at the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) are creating a “matchmaking” policy. This would require Chinese companies to buy a certain number of domestic chips, like Huawei’s Ascend series, with every Nvidia H200 order.

To make this work, Beijing has reportedly told tech companies to temporarily stop buying H200 chips. This pause prevents a rush to buy U.S. chips and to protect local companies’ market share. Soon, commercial buyers may also have to explain why domestic chips are not enough before they can import Nvidia products.

For the public sector, access is not allowed. Beijing plans to stop the military, state-owned companies, and key infrastructure operators from buying the H200, citing security risks and the chance that the U.S. could disable the hardware remotely.

Nvidia’s strict payment conditions

Stuck between two unpredictable governments, Nvidia has protected itself by setting strict payment rules for Chinese customers. Now, buyers must pay the full amount upfront for H200 orders, with no option to cancel or get a refund.

This cash-before-delivery approach puts all the financial risk on Chinese buyers if regulations change. Nvidia is being careful because, in 2025, it had to write off $5.5 billion in inventory after new U.S. export rules made its China-only H20 chip unsellable overnight.

“Nvidia has been burned in the past,” said a source familiar with the company. The payment structure ensures that if the political winds shift again, Nvidia isn’t left holding the bag. Even with these tough terms, Chinese companies are still eager to buy, underscoring their need for computing power to train large language models.

Geopolitical tug-of-war

The struggle over the H200 highlights a fundamental bifurcation in the global technology stack. While the U.S. attempts to maintain leverage through export controls and tariffs, China is accelerating its “Silicon Sovereignty” campaign.

U.S. bans have actually helped drive Chinese innovation. Local chipmakers like Huawei and Baidu are moving from backup roles to becoming “core pillars” of China’s AI industry, now controlling over 70% of the local cloud-computing chip market. While the H200 is still better for large-scale training, analysts note that the performance gap is narrowing.

For now, Nvidia is still in control. At CES, Huang avoided talking about politics and focused on supply and demand. “We learn about everything through purchase orders,” Huang said. “If the purchase orders come, it’s because they’re able to place purchase orders.”

Right now, the situation looks like a tug-of-war over regulations. The U.S. sometimes loosens rules to collect revenue but also tries to block sales to military sectors. China, seeing that it can’t rely on the U.S., is working hard to build its own technology so it won’t have to depend on American chips in the future.

As TSMC increases production and the U.S. collects its fees, the movement of H200 chips will show where global tech separation is heading. Nvidia is getting plenty of orders, but with constant policy changes, the situation remains unstable.",https://www.eetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/H200-China.png,N,,2026-01-09 04:58:45.073274

The 7.2% core growth rate achieved marked the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential core growth acceleration.
This structural resilience is why Agilent’s execution advantage becomes most visible during industry stress and not at cycle peaks.
For example, Danaher’s Life Sciences business saw a base-business core revenue drop of ~3% (11.5% including acquisitions/spins) in Q3 2023.
Conclusion: Value Justifies the Premium Agilent’s valuation premium is best understood through an owner’s lens, not through short-term earnings beats.","is a broad-based life science and analytical instrument company with a product portfolio spanning chromatography (GC/LC), mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, lab automation, vacuum technology, and related software/consumables. This workflow breadth and integrated approach differentiate it from peers. Agilent often wins large multi-instrument lab contracts and then captures high-margin follow-on revenue (service and supplies) through its Agilent CrossLab business.

Its pricing power is evidenced by industry-leading gross margins (~54% in FY2024) lifted by targeted price increases. The company also boasts a rapid innovation cycle for example, in 202223 Agilent introduced first?of?its?kind products like the HydroInert hydrogen-carrier gas source for GC-MS and new automation systems (AssayMAP and Seahorse), reinforcing technological leadership.

In contrast to (focused primarily on chromatography) or (smaller, Asia-centric), Agilent’s scope and recurring revenue streams (services + consumables) give it stronger customer lock-in. Compared to giants like or , Agilent’s pure-play instrument/service model allows leaner operations and faster share gains in niche markets.

Workflow breadth

Agilent uniquely offers end-to-end lab solutions (sample preparation automation, various analytical platforms, instrument-agnostic consumables, and software). It is a major vendor not only of GC/LC but also of mass spec, spectroscopy, and even cell analysis equipment. This contrasts with Waters (mostly HPLC/LCMS) or Shimadzu (strong in GC-MS in Asia but narrower). Agilent’s wide offering lets it bundle products and services across workflows, making customer switching harder.

Pricing power

High recurring volume and product differentiation allow Agilent to maintain healthy pricing. In FY2024, Agilent implemented targeted price increases that expanded overall gross margin by ~4 points to 54.3%stocklight.com, even with mixed sales.

In late 2023, Waters similarly noted gross-margin expansion of 170 bp (to ~59.6%) despite softer orders, but Agilent’s overall margin is buoyed by its service/consumable mix (CrossLab operating margin ~31.9% in FY2024). In practical terms, Agilent can raise prices on instruments and especially on recurring kits/columns year-over-year without losing all volume, a sign of pricing power above commoditized peers.

Innovation cycle

Agilent invests ~78% of sales in R&D, generating a steady stream of new products. Recent innovations (HydroInert, advanced LC columns, automated sample prep) have won awards and share gains. Management notes an innovation engine fueled by AI and technology partnerships.

Such rapid product refresh keeps Agilent’s lineup competitive. By contrast, some peers move more slowly or rely on acquisitions; Agilent’s focused R&D spending and leaner structure mean it can roll out new platforms (and the higher margin they command) faster.

Analyzing the Q4 Financial Beat: Margin and Growth Dynamics

Agilent concluded its fiscal year 2025 with strong operational results, showcasing accelerating momentum. For the fourth quarter ended October 31, 2025, the company reported revenue of $1.86 billion. This figure successfully surpassed the company’s own guidance range (which was $1.822 billion to $1.842 billion) and exceeded consensus expectations. The revenue represented a 9.4% reported increase and a 7.2% core growth rate compared to Q4 2024.

The strong top-line performance translated effectively into the bottom line. Non-GAAP net income reached $452 million, resulting in Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $1.59. This Non-GAAP EPS grew 9% from the prior year’s quarter and narrowly surpassed analyst forecasts.

GAAP net income was $434 million, or $1.53 per share, representing an even stronger YoY growth of 25%. For the full fiscal year 2025, Agilent generated total revenue of $6.95 billion, a 4.9% core growth increase, with Non-GAAP EPS of $5.59. The modest operating leverage demonstrated, where 9% EPS growth outpaced 7.2% core revenue growth, suggests effective cost management and pricing power were utilized throughout the period.

A critical element of the Q4 performance was the quality of execution demonstrated by management. The 7.2% core growth rate achieved marked the sixth consecutive quarter of sequential core growth acceleration. Management commentary emphasized that these top-line results ""compare very favorably with our peers,"" indicating market share capture and operational strength in a market environment still defined by signs of normalization.

The robust execution performance substantially reduces the intrinsic execution risk modeled into future projections, particularly the outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. Strong current execution means a lower probability of a major shortfall in the subsequent period. The fact that the company is delivering strong financial results while simultaneously planning for ""incremental investments in growth and innovation"" indicates management’s confidence in its operational efficiencies. This level of confidence allows investors and analysts to model future cash flows with a higher degree of certainty, which, in a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation framework, warrants a lower required discount rate, thereby bolstering the calculated intrinsic value.

Execution Excellence Is Structural, Not Cyclical

Agilent’s recent outperformance should not be viewed as a short-term execution win tied to a single quarter. Instead, it reflects a deliberate business architecture designed to perform best during industry downturns, precisely when relative execution differences become visible.

Agilent has intentionally built a large, services- and consumables-heavy revenue stream that is economically tied to its installed base rather than new instrument placements. During tool-sector slowdowns, when customers defer capital equipment purchases, demand for services, compliance support, replacement parts, and consumables does not disappear in many cases; it increases. Labs sweat existing assets harder, raising utilization and service intensity. This makes CrossLab counter-cyclical in practice, not just defensive in theory.

Second, installed-base monetization rises when instrument spending pauses

Unlike peers that rely more heavily on upfront instrument sales, Agilent monetizes customers across the full instrument lifecycle. Once a system is placed, it generates years of high-margin follow-on revenue through qualification, maintenance, software, and consumables. This means that when new system demand normalizes, Agilent continues to compound value from past placements, a dynamic that only becomes visible during downturns.

Third, balance-sheet conservatism enables reinvestment when peers retrench

Agilent’s low leverage and operating discipline inherited from its HP lineage allow it to maintain R&D intensity and make incremental growth investments even during cyclical slowdowns. While more leveraged peers are forced to protect margins or reduce spending, Agilent can play offense: funding innovation, strengthening customer relationships, and selectively investing in capacity or tuck-in acquisitions.

All major life-science tools companies possess elements of these traits, but Agilent’s model combines them more evenly and consistently. This structural resilience is why Agilent’s execution advantage becomes most visible during industry stress and not at cycle peaks.

Navigating Cyclical Normalization

The analytical tools sector is cyclical, tied to lab capex budgets and macro swings. Agilent’s recent earnings illustrate how it handled a downcycle better than most peers. In FY2023 (ended Oct ’23), many labs delayed equipment spend; Agilent’s Life Sciences segment (instruments) fell ~4% on the year (core), but CrossLab grew ~10% core.

Overall revenue was essentially flat (+1.5% core) with GAAP EPS steady at $4.19. Management noted that despite a challenging year for the industry, Agilent delivered leveraged earnings and expects a slow but steady recovery.

By contrast, peers saw sharper declines. For example, Danaher’s Life Sciences business saw a base-business core revenue drop of ~3% (11.5% including acquisitions/spins) in Q3 2023. Waters’ Q4 2023 sales fell ~8% organically, with instrument sales off ~14% even as recurring revenue grew.

Agilent’s more diversified end markets (pharma, biotech, academia, environment, materials) and its heavy tilt toward consumables/services meant it was less exposed to any single slump. Structurally, Agilent benefited from:

Lean cost structure: Even as top-line softened, Agilent held the line on R&D and cut some SG&A, which expanded margins. (FY2024 non-GAAP OPEX shrank ~4% YoYs)

Segment reorganization: In late 2023, Agilent regrouped its units (forming a Life Sciences & Diagnostics Markets Group, etc.), aiming for tighter market focus. This build/buy strategy (including the 2024 BioVectra CDMO acquisition) positioned Agilent to capture growth as markets recover.

Operational discipline: Through the cycle, Agilent generated roughly stable operating cash (~$1.75 B in FY24, similar to $1.77 B in FY23), showing it can sustain cash flow even with uneven revenues.

Capital Efficiency & Value Creation

Agilent’s business model converts sales into cash very efficiently, fueling high ROIC and shareholder returns. In FY2024, it generated ~$1.75 B of operating cash. After capital expenditures ($378 M) and acquisitions, free cash flow ran about $1.4 B (consistent with reporting and analytics). In other words, ~90% of net income flows out as cash.

This is aided by moderate reinvestment: FY2024 capex was only ~6% of (mostly to expand manufacturing, e.g., in diagnostics and CDMO), and R&D spends around 78% of revenue. The result is a high return on invested capital. Agilent’s ROIC has been ~1314% in recent years, meaning each dollar reinvested yields strong profit.

With this cash, Agilent aggressively rewards investors. In FY2024, the company repurchased 8.4 million shares at ~$1.15 Bn and paid $274 M in dividends. That $1.15 Bn buyback alone was ~10% of market cap, cutting share count significantly and boosting EPS. The board has authorized up to $2.0 B more in buybacks. Meanwhile, leverage remains low modest net debt after the BioVectra acquisition. In summary, Agilent turns profit into cash, then redeploys it into growth (BioVectra, R&D) and buybacks, compounding intrinsic value.

Growth Drivers & GLP1 Tailwind

Agilent’s future growth rests on secular trends across life sciences and applied markets. Major end markets include pharma/biotech R&D, diagnostics (e.g., cancer screening), food/environment testing, and advanced materials (semiconductors, EV batteries). In each, demand for precision analysis is rising. For example, as biologic drug R&D grows, so does the need for Agilent’s chromatography and mass spec systems.

The recent cell therapy boom and genomics also help Agilent’s diagnostics tools. In industrial markets, trends like semiconductor reshoring and PFAS water testing require analytical instruments.

GLP-1 peptide drugs (e.g. weight-loss diabetes treatments) have drawn investor hype as a demand driver. Agilent notes that its GLP-1-related sales were about $130 million in FY2025 (split roughly evenly between its new BioVectra manufacturing subsidiary and lab instruments/consumables), which was up ~20% from the prior year. In Q4 alone, GLP-1 work drove ~$40M of revenue.

However, GLP-1s are just one end-market. They accounted for only a few percent of Agilent’s ~$6.8B sales, and growth there partly reflects Air chromatography columns and Oligo synthesis tools that also serve other peptide/oligo markets. We view GLP-1 as a proportional tailwind, not a core moat.

The company itself treats GLP-1 as a subset of its Pharma & Biotech market growth. Over the long run, fundamental drivers remain broader: multi-year CAGR in global lab equipment (?57%), genomics, biologics R&D, and lab automation adoption.

Other growth levers include Agilent’s expanding footprint in high-value fields: its recent BioVectra acquisition (~$145M revenues, specializing in custom synthesis/CDMO for mRNA and oligos) promises to tap booming biologics manufacturing demand. Its Diagnostics & Genomics Group (cancer diagnostics, next-gen sequencing) is small today but growing. Meanwhile, capitalizing on software and AI (integrated lab informatics) could unlock more value per customer (Agilent is asymmetrically investing in software in CrossLab).

Valuation Landscape: Price vs. Intrinsic Value

A deep dive into Agilent’s valuation multiples, comparing the stock against its historical averages and its high-quality peer group, helps determine if the current market price reflects the company’s strong operational execution and robust intrinsic value drivers. As of November 26, 2025, Agilent’s stock trades at a premium when viewed against its recent historical valuation averages.

Agilent Valuation Multiples (Absolute and Historical)

The current Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.07x represents an approximate 8.16% premium over the stock’s 5-year average P/E of 33.35x. This premium suggests that the market is already pricing in the expected acceleration in core growth, the achievement of the projected 75 basis points in operating margin expansion, and the de-risking of the business model through the strong Q4 FY2025 execution. The market is effectively assigning a higher growth rate and/or lower risk to Agilent’s future earnings profile relative to its own recent history.

Peer Group Comparison: Benchmarking Execution Quality

Comparing Agilent using the Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) multiple offers a clearer view of its relative operational valuation, independent of capital structure differences. Agilent trades at 23.7x EV/EBITDA on a trailing twelve months (LTM) basis.

Comparative Valuation Metrics: Life Science & Applied Markets Peers

Agilent’s valuation multiple is slightly higher than or equivalent to its key large peers, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (23.0x EV/EBITDA) and Waters Corporation (22.0x EV/EBITDA). This marginal premium assigned to Agilent validates management’s assertion of superior execution. Despite being smaller than global giants like Thermo Fisher, Agilent is valued equivalently or slightly higher on a per-unit operating profit basis. This market assessment implies that investors are willing to pay a premium for Agilent’s high-quality revenue base (ACG), its demonstrated ability to capture market share, and its focused exposure to powerful secular trends like GLP-1, positioning it as a ""premium-priced growth stabilizer"" within the life science tools sector.

Following the Financial Titans: Recent Guru Activity

Agilent’s valuation premium is further supported by the presence of patient, long-term institutional owners that have historically favored resilient, cash-rich compounders over cyclical earnings stories. Firms such as Durable Capital (Henry Ellenbogen), Capital Group, and Wellington Management all rank among Agilent’s meaningful shareholders, collectively representing a substantial portion of the company’s long-term institutional ownership base.

These firms are known for building concentrated positions in businesses that demonstrate high free-cash-flow conversion, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to reinvest consistently through economic cycles. Durable Capital, in particular, has a track record of backing companies with structurally recurring revenues and strong balance sheets, while Capital Group and Wellington have long emphasized downside resilience and capital preservation alongside growth.

Conclusion: Value Justifies the Premium

Agilent’s valuation premium is best understood through an owner’s lens, not through short-term earnings beats. The company consistently converts a high proportion of operating income into free cash flow, supported by a recurring revenue base that stabilizes cash generation precisely when industry conditions weaken.

The CrossLab business is central to this dynamic. Its recurring, contract-driven revenue stream lowers cash-flow volatility and reduces the risk of capital impairment across cycles. This predictability allows Agilent to self-fund reinvestment through downturns, sustaining R&D, supporting innovation, and strengthening competitive positioning, while peers with higher leverage or more cyclical revenue profiles are forced to pull back.

This combination of high cash conversion, structural recurrence, and balance-sheet strength underpins Agilent’s ability to compound intrinsic value over time. Investors are not paying a premium for growth alone but for a business model that preserves and reinvests capital efficiently across cycles.

Long-term patient capital has historically recognized these traits. Institutions such as Durable Capital, Capital Group, and Wellington have demonstrated sustained interest in companies with resilient cash-flow profiles, disciplined reinvestment, and durable competitive advantages, characteristics that align closely with Agilent’s operating model. Viewed through this lens, Agilent’s modest valuation premium reflects lower business risk and higher long-term capital efficiency, rather than optimism embedded in near-term earnings expectations.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 08:01:29.681434

The brokerage maintained its negative outlook on European autos heading into 2026, warning that ""downgrades and deratings coming"" despite the sector’s year-end resilience.

Analysts identified and Ferrari as their most preferred original equipment manufacturers, while keeping , Stellantis, and at “equal weight.”

""Ultimately, it has been striking, and to some extent surprising to us, how much the market has shrugged off BMW’s (mostly China-related) Q3 profit warning and how the share price has decoupled from forward earnings revisions,"" the analysts said.

BMW’s downgrade comes with an unchanged €82.50 price target, implying 12% downside from €93.06 levels.

Barclays forecasts BMW’s automotive EBIT at roughly €6.5 billion with a 5.2% margin for 2026, sitting 7% and 50 basis points below Bloomberg consensus respectively. The brokerage’s €10.57 earnings per share estimate for 2026 trails consensus by 7%.

The analysts remain ""structurally negative on premium German OEMs in China,"" where BMW generates about 30% of both volume and profit.

A significant headwind comes from Neue Klasse production, expected to drive a ""high three-digit"" million euro increase in depreciation year-over-year.

Porsche received a price target cut to €40 from €42.50, representing 15% downside from €46.49. Barclays sits 6% below consensus on 2027 EBIT, forecasting about 20,000 fewer units than the street expects.

""Even the bottom of the new mid-term target margin ambition of 10-15% should be very difficult to reach until 2028 at the earliest, in light of lower volumes, persistent US tariffs, persistent supplier compensation, China weakness/luxury tax and weaker BEV demand,"" according to the brokerage.

Volkswagen maintained its “overweight” rating and €125 price target, implying 21% upside. For 2026, Barclays forecasts €18 billion in EBIT and €5.5 billion in free cash flow, with the latter approximately 20% above consensus.

The company has committed to €1.5 billion in wage savings in Germany by 2026 versus 2024.

Mercedes-Benz retained “equal weight” with the price target raised to €55 from €52.50, though this implies 9% downside from €60.36.

The analysts positioned Mercedes as preferred over BMW given ""MBG’s stronger H2 FCF and re-start of its SBB vs BMW’s Q3 warning and strong stock performance.""

U.S. tariffs remain a 100 to 150 basis point EBIT margin burden across European automakers. Mercedes-Benz faces 150 to 200 basis points of impact, BMW sees 150 basis points, Volkswagen confronts 100 to 150 basis points, and Porsche deals with 150 to 200 basis points of margin headwind in 2026, according to Barclays estimates.

SPX Technologies Investment Narrative Recap

To own SPX Technologies, I think you need to believe that its HVAC and Detection & Measurement platforms can convert project backlogs and data center demand into durable earnings, despite cyclical and competitive pressures. Whitman’s appointment and the warm-water cooling debate do not appear to change the core near term catalyst, which still centers on executing against data center cooling demand, or the key risk around potential growth lumpiness in the D&M project pipeline.

The most relevant recent development here is Nvidia’s warm-water data center cooling commentary, which briefly pressured SPX’s share price but, according to TD Cowen analysis, still leaves cooling towers as a required part of liquid-cooled designs. For investors focused on SPX’s data center catalyst, this reinforces that the OlympusV Max launch and ongoing capacity expansions matter most, while also highlighting how quickly sentiment can swing on perceived technology shifts.

Yet investors should be aware that if large Detection & Measurement projects pulled into 2025 do not repeat in later years, SPX’s earnings could...

SPX Technologies' narrative projects $2.6 billion revenue and $388.1 million earnings by 2028. This requires 8.9% yearly revenue growth and about a $176.5 million earnings increase from $211.6 million today.

Uncover how SPX Technologies' forecasts yield a $234.78 fair value, a 13% upside to its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Successor liability arises from the concept of undertaking which defines the infringer in EU antitrust law.
In reality, the apparent inconsistency of the CJEU’s case law on successor liability conceals a clear underlying objective that shapes the EU approach.
Instead, the Commission’s principal aim with successor liability is to secure payment of the fine.
As a first step, antitrust liability should be reframed as a form of substitute liability in the context of M&A successor liability.","Mergers & acquisitions (M&A) practices are often known for their frantic pace, a rhythm that can conflict with the careful consideration required for antitrust issues. Yet, while frequently underestimated in M&A deals, antitrust risks can become quite costly under the EU’s doctrine of successor liability.

Successor liability arises from the concept of undertaking which defines the infringer in EU antitrust law. On this basis, the Commission may attribute liability for antitrust infringements to a legal entity that was not operating the business at the time of the misconduct, including a buyer in an M&A transaction. While this approach broadens the scope of antitrust liability, it stands in tension with fundamental principles of corporate law, which generally preserve the legal separateness of entities and protect shareholders from company debts.

Traditionally, the doctrine of successor liability was applied in three situations: when the original infringer no longer existed, when companies were linked through structural ties, and when the transfer occurred under abusive, non-market conditions. Yet, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) gradually expanded the scope of successor liability through its case law, making its application increasingly unpredictable and creating significant legal uncertainty for M&A transactions.

This uncertainty is illustrated by four factually very similar cases in which the CJEU nevertheless reached four different outcomes. In each case, a company involved in a cartel sold its infringing assets, raising the same legal question: after the transfer, which entity should bear the fine for breaches of EU antitrust law? In Hoechst [2009], liability remained with the original infringer despite the transfer of cartelised assets (para 16), while in Moreda liability was shifted to the newly merged successor notwithstanding a similar transfer of infringing assets (para 318). By contrast, in Parker Hannifin [2014], the Court held the acquirer of the cartel-related assets responsible, allowing liability to follow the transferred assets rather than the original infringer (para 41). Finally, in Prysmian [2020], liability was extended simultaneously to both the former and new parent companies (para 19).

In reality, the apparent inconsistency of the CJEU’s case law on successor liability conceals a clear underlying objective that shapes the EU approach. Contrary to what some scholars suggest, the Commission’s concern here is not primarily deterrence, as it is in the doctrines of parental and subsidiary liability. Parental liability rests on the parent company’s control over the infringing entity at some point in time. By contrast, in cases of successor liability, assuming the infringing activity was discontinued, successors had no such control and thus could not have prevented the infringement. For this reason, deterrence offers little justification for extending liability to successors. Instead, the Commission’s principal aim with successor liability is to secure payment of the fine.

EU legislators should acknowledge this enforcement goal openly and shift the burden away from buyers in M&A transactions, placing it instead on sellers, who are considerably more likely to have exercised control over the infringement at some point in time. This could be achieved through a two-step approach: (1) introducing substitute liability and (2) establishing mandatory escrow accounts.

As a first step, antitrust liability should be reframed as a form of substitute liability in the context of M&A successor liability. The law ought to recognize that buyers had no control over antitrust infringements committed prior to an acquisition, and acquirers should therefore be seen as paying on behalf of the perpetrator rather than being the perpetrator themselves. In practice, this would mean that the successor could be required to satisfy the fine not because it engaged in the infringement, but to ensure that it is collected when no other alternative is available. Borrowing from the 2017 amendments to the German Competition Act, specifically section 81 a, such an obligation would function as a financial guarantee rather than a sanction, placing the acquirer in the role of guarantor rather than culprit.

This approach carries several advantages. It avoids stigmatizing successor companies as cartelists and shields them from reputational harm. It also protects acquirers from regulatory consequences such as repeat-offender status, license revocations, or blacklisting. Codifying this substitute liability would further enhance legal certainty, since buyers would know in advance that they may be pursued as substitute payers. For enforcers, the model is equally attractive: because it does not involve any allegation of wrongdoing, the procedural safeguards attached to fines need not apply. At the same time, it ensures more reliable collection, makes evasion more difficult, and simplifies enforcement by avoiding complex continuity tests and reducing litigation, as the substitute debtor cannot dispute intent or fault.

This brings us to the financial risks faced by acquirers in M&A transactions. Protection from reputational and regulatory consequences, as well as greater legal certainty, offers limited comfort when buyers may still be required to shoulder substantial antitrust fines. To address this concern, the second part of the solution is the introduction of mandatory antitrust escrow accounts to M&A deals.

Escrow accounts were originally a common law mechanism which serve as a financial safeguard and thus complement the benefits of substitute liability. Their trigger event should be the payment of antitrust indemnification claims brought by the buyer or third parties against the target. Crucially, though, to ensure that fines are paid following an M&A deal, such accounts must be subject to both a minimum amount and a minimum term. The reasoning is straightforward: if the funds are insufficient, antitrust fines cannot be paid, and the burden once again shifts from the seller to the buyer.

The escrow amount should cover a substantial portion, though not the entirety, of any potential antitrust fine. The key is to strike a balance: easing the buyer’s financial burden, while addressing moral hazard and avoiding excessive immobilization of the seller’s proceeds. As for the minimum escrow term, the most appropriate benchmark from a buyer’s perspective is the prescriptive period of antitrust fines, excluding disputed sums.

Overall, substitute liability in combination with mandatory escrow accounts could substantially reduce the antitrust related risks faced by acquirers in M&A transactions in Europe. By combining elements from both common law and civil law traditions, this approach would increase legal certainty for buyers, shield them from reputational and regulatory harm, and ensure that a significant share of fines is born by sellers. At the same time, it would facilitate enforcement by guaranteeing payment, even if this means temporarily restricting access to part of seller’s proceeds.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/fileTPSASt,N,,2026-01-09 02:00:11.663884

It is easy to understand that few investments perfectly meet these four criteria, making it complex to rank the options considered.","What a journey from the blackboard to dark chocolate!

From a young age, we learn on the blackboard in math class that if A is greater than B and B is greater than C, then A is greater than C. But very early on, sometimes as soon as the next recess, the game rock-paper-scissors casts doubt on these obvious truths: indeed, the player who shows a hand symbolizing rock beats the one representing scissors, scissors beat paper, but paper beats rock by covering it! Thus, the hierarchy of choices is not so obvious and is so complex that this basic game has given rise to abundant literature on how to win.

The problem of transitivity of preferences becomes more complex when the choice is no longer based on one criterion (in our example, rock wins or loses) but on three criteria to rank options. Imagine Céline hesitating between three boxes of dark chocolates to offer her guests at the New Year's Eve party:

- the ""artisan box"" costs €15 for 12 chocolates with 3 fillings,

- the ""gourmet box"" costs €20 for 20 chocolates with 2 fillings,

- the ""luxury box"" costs €25 for 24 chocolates but with only one filling.

Obviously, on the price criterion, the artisan box is preferred over the gourmet box, which in turn is preferred over the luxury box. For the number of fillings, the gourmet box is preferred over the luxury box; but the luxury box, overlooked in the previous criteria, is preferred over the artisan box for the number of chocolates it contains!

The landmark study2 on intransitivity of preferences in multicriteria choices dates back to 1969. Amos Tversky asked participants to rank 45 candidate profiles by successive pairs according to three criteria (intelligence, emotion and sociability), the first indicated as essential and each quantified by scores. The author highlights the use of the semi-lexicographic order3, which is a decision rule where options are compared according to a hierarchy of criteria, taking into account thresholds to judge whether a difference is relevant. The existence of a sensitivity threshold below which small differences are ignored leads to intransitive preferences and ultimately to contradictions between choices that participants do not perceive at all.

One can easily imagine the complexity of choosing the box of dark chocolates to offer when, moreover, one must choose not according to one’s own (incoherent) preferences but on behalf of someone else!

Not everything is so black!

Thus, even in the presence of clear criteria, choice can be complex. Enough to discourage any desire to make relevant financial decisions. In personal finance, it is already complicated to rank choices based solely on the risk/return pair. Indeed, to be meaningful, one must properly understand the desired level of return and the acceptance of risk (which vary between individuals) but also correctly assess the probabilities of realizing that return and that risk.

The question of transitivity of preferences arises as soon as different criteria are mixed. Yet, the risk/return pair constitutes a criterion to be evaluated just like liquidity (the ability to sell a financial asset without time constraints), volatility (a linear increase in the value of an asset or erratic evolution that can cause the discomfort of a latent loss), or the time dimension (short, medium, or long term). It is easy to understand that few investments perfectly meet these four criteria, making it complex to rank the options considered.

Returning to the reference study on the subject, Tversky compares the results proposed by participants with those given by the Weighted Scoring Technique method, which precisely respects transitivity and coherence. This method ranks options by adding the scores obtained for each of the different criteria, previously weighted.

In this methodology, we find the principle known to students: that of the weighted average of different scores… including that of the math class at the beginning of the article! Like rock-paper-scissors… the circle is closed once again.

Aktis priced 17.65 million shares at $18 each, more than what it planned to sell, according to an updated securities filing earlier this week. It upsized the round after Eli Lilly, which previously partnered with the cancer drugmaker, stepped in to purchase $100 million, or a third of the shares. Aktis will begin trading Friday on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “AKTS.”

The company, which is based in Boston, is developing a twist on specialized cancer drugs that it says can hit tumor targets “outside the scope” of other radiopharmaceuticals.

AKY-1189, its most advanced prospect, is a “miniprotein radioconjugate” targeting Nectin-4, the same protein that Pfizer’s bladder cancer drug Padcev binds to. Aktis is studying what other cancers it could be used in, with Phase 1 study results expected in the first quarter of 2027.

A second experimental drug, dubbed AKY-2519, goes after solid tumors that express a protein called B7-H3. Tumors with high levels of B7-H3 have been hard to treat, responding poorly to other cancer therapies such as anti-PD1 drugs, according to Aktis. The collaboration with Lilly could yield additional radiopharmaceutical targets.

Prior to its IPO, Aktis banked $346 million in private funding to advance its pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals, including investments from MPM BioImpact, Vida Ventures and RA Capital.

Canada-U.S. flight volumes fell more than 14 per cent year-over-year in the fourth quarter among Canada’s five largest carriers — Air Canada, WestJet, Porter Airlines, Air Transat and Flair Airlines — according to figures from aviation data firm Cirium.

Florida, California and Nevada saw some of the biggest drops in capacity from Canadian carriers, with volumes to Las Vegas down by a third from a year earlier.

Meanwhile, as passengers looked farther afield, airlines ramped up flight volumes in the Caribbean and South America — by 36 per cent last quarter and 45 per cent in the current one.

The number of domestic flights and trips to Europe and Asia also rose from 2024 as airlines scrambled to rejig their networks.

Former transport professor Jacques Roy says Canadians’ distaste for U.S. visits triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff war and social policies nonetheless marks a problem for airlines north of the border, which will have to compete in more crowded fields overseas and domestically.

“There is a natural reaction from Canadian travellers, who try to get their suntan from other destinations,"" he said.

Nor are there signs of a return to business as usual. Canadian airline schedules show a 15 per cent drop in U.S. flight volumes during the first three months of this year compared to 2025 — when passengers had already started to shy away from travel to a country whose leader spouted 51st-state rhetoric in reference to its northern neighbour.

First-quarter volumes for Arizona-bound flights are scheduled to fall by more than 20 per cent year-over-year. For Florida, the figure is nearly 19 per cent.

""The airlines were hoping that this was just going to be a flash in the pan ... that it would eventually settle back into a return to sun destinations by the time the fourth quarter rolled along,"" said John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University.

That didn't happen. ""And the first quarter doesn’t look much brighter.”

The first-quarter decrease amounts to nearly 850,000 seats, according to Cirium.

""We see no indication that this trend will change in the foreseeable future, so we are anticipating further reductions to our transborder network in 2026,"" said WestJet spokeswoman Julia Kaiser in an email.

On the plus side, Canadians' appetite for winter air travel has persisted, despite trips that are farther from home and sometimes harder on the wallet.

Air Canada launched more than a dozen fresh routes and several new destinations in the Caribbean and South America — Rio de Janeiro, Guatemala City, and Cartagena, Colombia, among them — over the last few months.

Some beachy getaway spots saw massive surges. WestJet increased flights to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic last quarter to 1,018 from 320 a year earlier.

Canadian flight volumes to Cancun, Mexico, jumped by 35 per cent, and to Central America by nearly a third last quarter. This quarter, they're poised to leap by 104 per cent for the Bahamas, 36 per cent for Brazil, and 28 per cent for Aruba, according to Cirium.

""Canadians are moving and they're trying different destinations,"" Gradek said.

Mark Galardo, Air Canada's chief commercial officer, stressed that the downturn in tourist travel to the U.S. is ""not catastrophic,"" with the decline in its U.S. flight volumes holding steady at about 10 per cent through most of last year and into 2026.

“We see a plateau. The situation has not worsened,"" he said in a phone interview.

Meanwhile, Americans continue to flock to Canada by air. The tally rose more than six per cent year-over-year to 448,000 in October, according to Statistics Canada. And residents of both countries still touch down on each other's turf for layovers on flights to Europe and Asia, keeping planes largely full.

Canadians' thirst for trips to Europe is only partly linked to their aversion to America, Galardo added.

""We're seeing a lot of demand growth into European leisure destinations,"" he said. Hence new routes to Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.

In the U.S., the airline has swapped in smaller planes and lowered flight frequencies to airports in southern states, and even dropped a few routes, he noted.

For its part, Porter had to pivot drastically last year amid a rapid fleet expansion that hinged largely on growth in U.S. markets.

More than 40 per cent of its flight volume stemmed from American trips a year ago, versus just over a quarter now, according to vice-president of network planning Andrew Pierce.

The country's third-largest airline flew zero routes beyond Canada and the U.S. in January 2025; this month it will fly about 500 — to Cancun and Puerto Vallarta in Mexico as well as Costa Rica and the Cayman Islands.

""We're new to a lot of that region of the world, but it's exactly the right timing for the demand,"" Pierce said.

Agreement provides Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical products an exemption from U.S. tariffs

Company announces two new additional manufacturing facilities to be built in North Carolina and Pennsylvania; continues to deliver on $55 billion U.S. investment

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) (the “Company”), healthcare’s leading, most comprehensive innovation powerhouse, today announced a voluntary agreement with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The joint agreement meets the requests laid out by President Trump to the industry and provides the Company’s pharmaceutical products an exemption from tariffs1.

“Today’s agreement shows that when the public and private sectors work together towards shared goals, we can deliver real results for patients and the U.S. economy,” said Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & Johnson. “I’m proud that Johnson & Johnson is answering President Trump’s call to lower drug prices for everyday Americans while maintaining our role in improving and saving lives and ensuring that the United States continues to lead the world in healthcare innovation.”

Improving Access and Lowering Costs for U.S. Patients

Johnson & Johnson is working with the Trump Administration to improve access to medicines and lower costs for millions of American patients. The Company is:

Participating in TrumpRx.gov, a direct to patient platform, which will allow millions of American patients to purchase medicines from Johnson & Johnson at significantly discounted rates.

Enabling American patients to access medicines at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Providing Medicaid program access at comparable prices to other developed countries.

Continuing to support the Administration's efforts to ensure better recognition of the value of health care across developed markets globally.

Delivering On Our $55B U.S. Investment

Johnson & Johnson also continues to deliver on our previously announced $55 billion investment to support U.S. manufacturing, research and development, and technology investments by early 2029. In just the last 10 months, the Company has initiated billions of dollars in investment in U.S. manufacturing, which will support the Company’s goal of manufacturing the vast majority of its advanced medicines in the U.S. to meet the needs of U.S. patients.

Today, as part of the $55 billion investment, the Company is announcing two new U.S. manufacturing facilities, including a next generation cell therapy manufacturing site in Pennsylvania and a state-of-the-art drug product manufacturing facility in North Carolina.

Additionally, construction is progressing on our $2 billion state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing facility in Wilson, North Carolina, which the Company broke ground on last year. That project will create approximately 5,000 skilled manufacturing and construction jobs in the state. Johnson & Johnson is already ramping up the hiring of advanced manufacturing employees to work at the facility.

In September, the Company also secured a new 160,000+ square foot dedicated biopharmaceutical manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina. The $2 billion commitment over the next 10 years will create approximately 120 new jobs in North Carolina.

Johnson & Johnson expects to announce additional U.S. investments later this year.

Prospectus Supplement dated November 16, 2023Prospectus dated April 12, 2024

The notes are not deposits or savings accounts and are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

The Notes

The notes are debt securities of Morgan Stanley. We describe the basic features of these notes in the sections of the accompanying prospectus called “Description of Debt Securities—Fixed Rate Debt Securities” and prospectus supplement called “Description of Notes,” subject to and as modified by the provisions described below. All payments on the notes are subject to the credit risk of Morgan Stanley.

The stated principal amount and issue price of each note is $1,000. This price includes costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes, which are borne by you, and, consequently, the estimated value of the notes on the pricing date will be less than the issue price. We estimate that the value of each note on the pricing date will be approximately $976.50 or within $56.50 of that estimate. Our estimate of the value of the notes as determined on the pricing date will be set forth in the final pricing supplement.

What goes into the estimated value on the pricing date?

In valuing the notes on the pricing date, we take into account that the notes comprise both a debt component and a performance-based component linked to interest rates. The estimated value of the notes is determined using our own pricing and valuation models, market inputs and assumptions relating to volatility and other factors including current and expected interest rates, as well as an interest rate related to our secondary market credit spread, which is the implied interest rate at which our conventional fixed rate debt trades in the secondary market.

What determines the economic terms of the notes?

In determining the economic terms of the notes, including the interest rate applicable to each interest payment period, we use an internal funding rate, which is likely to be lower than our secondary market credit spreads and therefore advantageous to us. If the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging costs borne by you were lower or if the internal funding rate were higher, one or more of the economic terms of the securities would be more favorable to you.

What is the relationship between the estimated value on the pricing date and the secondary market price of the notes?

The price at which MS & Co. purchases the notes in the secondary market, absent changes in market conditions, including those related to interest rates, may vary from, and be lower than, the estimated value on the pricing date, because the secondary market price takes into account our secondary market credit spread as well as the bid-offer spread that MS & Co. would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type, the costs of unwinding the related hedging transactions and other factors.

MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the notes and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time.

Risk Factors

The notes involve risks not associated with an investment in ordinary fixed rate notes. This section describes the material risks relating to the notes. For a complete list of risk factors, please see the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus. Investors should consult their financial and legal advisers as to the risks entailed by an investment in the notes and the suitability of the notes in light of their particular circumstances.

Risks Relating to an Investment in the Notes

￭Investors are subject to our credit risk, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the notes. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the notes on interest payment dates and at maturity and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. The notes are not guaranteed by any other entity. If we default on our obligations under the notes, your investment would be at risk and you could lose some or all of your investment. As a result, the market value of the notes prior to maturity will be affected by changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any actual or anticipated decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the notes.

￭The price at which the notes may be sold prior to maturity will depend on a number of factors and may be substantially less than the amount for which they were originally purchased. Some of these factors include, but are not limited to: (i) actual or anticipated changes in interest and yield rates, (ii) any actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads and (iii) time remaining to maturity.Generally, the longer the time remaining to maturity and the more tailored the exposure, the more the market price of the notes will be affected by the other factors described in the preceding sentence. This can lead to significant adverse changes in the market price of securities like the notes. Depending on the actual or anticipated level of interest and yield rates, the market value of the notes is expected to decrease and you may receive substantially less than 100% of the issue price if you are able to sell your notes prior to maturity.

￭The rate we are willing to pay for securities of this type, maturity and issuance size is likely to be lower than the rate implied by our secondary market credit spreads and advantageous to us. Both the lower rate and the inclusion of costs associated with issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes in the original issue price reduce the economic terms of the notes, cause the estimated value of the notes to be less than the original issue price and will adversely affect secondary market prices. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors, the prices, if any, at which dealers, including MS & Co., are willing to purchase the notes in secondary market transactions will likely be significantly lower than the original issue price, because secondary market prices will exclude the issuing, selling, structuring and hedging-related costs that are included in the original issue price and borne by you and because the secondary market prices will reflect our secondary market credit spreads and the bid-offer spread that any dealer would charge in a secondary market transaction of this type, the costs of unwinding the related hedging transactions as well as other factors.

The inclusion of the costs of issuing, selling, structuring and hedging the notes in the original issue price and the lower rate we are willing to pay as issuer make the economic terms of the notes less favorable to you than they otherwise would be.

￭The estimated value of the notes is determined by reference to our pricing and valuation models, which may differ from those of other dealers and is not a maximum or minimum secondary market price. These pricing and valuation models are proprietary and rely in part on subjective views of certain market inputs and certain assumptions about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, because there is no market-standard way to value these types of securities, our models may yield a higher estimated value of the notes than those generated by others, including other dealers in the market, if they attempted to value the notes. In addition, the estimated value on the pricing date does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which dealers, including MS & Co., would be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The value of your notes at any time after the date of this pricing supplement will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including our creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.

￭The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange and secondary trading may be limited. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore, there may be little or no secondary market for the notes. MS & Co. may, but is not obligated to, make a market in the notes and, if it once chooses to make a market, may cease doing so at any time. When it does make a market, it will generally do so for transactions of routine secondary market size at prices based on its estimate of the current value of the notes, taking into account its bid/offer spread, our credit spreads, market volatility, the notional size of the proposed sale, the cost of unwinding any related hedging positions, the time remaining to maturity and the likelihood that it will be able to resell the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the notes easily. Since other broker-dealers may not participate significantly in the secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which MS & Co. is willing to transact. If, at any time, MS & Co. were to cease making a market in the notes, it is likely that there would be no secondary market for the notes. Accordingly, you should be willing to hold your notes to maturity.

Use of Proceeds and Hedging

The proceeds we receive from the sale of the notes will be used for general corporate purposes. We will receive, in aggregate, $1,000 per note issued, because, when we enter into hedging transactions in order to meet our obligations under the notes, our hedging counterparty will reimburse the cost of the Agent’s commissions. The costs of the notes borne by you and described on page 2 above comprise the Agent’s commissions and the cost of issuing, structuring and hedging the notes.

Supplemental Information Concerning Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of Interest

The agent may distribute the notes through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley Wealth Management”), as selected dealer, or other dealers, which may include Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”) and Bank Morgan Stanley AG. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, MSIP and Bank Morgan Stanley AG are affiliates of Morgan Stanley. Selected dealers, including Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, and their financial advisors will collectively receive from the agent, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, a fixed sales commission of $ for each note they sell; provided that dealers selling to investors purchasing the notes in fee-based advisory accounts will not receive a sales commission with respect to such notes.

MS & Co. is our wholly owned subsidiary and it and other subsidiaries of ours expect to make a profit by selling, structuring and, when applicable, hedging the notes. When MS & Co. prices this offering of notes, it will determine the economic terms of the notes such that for each note the estimated value on the pricing date will be no lower than the minimum level described in “The Notes” on page 2.

MS & Co. will conduct this offering in compliance with the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., which is commonly referred to as FINRA, regarding a FINRA member firm’s distribution of the securities of an affiliate and related conflicts of interest. MS & Co. or any of our other affiliates may not make sales in this offering to any discretionary account.

Acceleration Amount in Case of an Event of Default

In case an event of default with respect to the notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the amount declared due and payable per note upon any acceleration of the notes shall be an amount in cash equal to the stated principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., Jan. 8, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Johnson & Johnson today announced Tony Hunter, Ph.D., of the Salk Institute as the recipient of the 2025 Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research. Dr. Hunter is honored for his role in the discovery of tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation as mechanisms for the malignant transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and other disease states.

""Dr. Hunter's discoveries are the cornerstone upon which today's cancer therapies have been built,"" said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine R&D for Johnson & Johnson. ""His groundbreaking work embodies the legacy and spirit of Dr. Paul Janssen and J&J's ongoing commitment to cancer research – addressing patient needs and improving health for all.""

Dr. Hunter's seminal discovery four decades ago paved the way for the development of more than 80 cancer therapies and sparked innovation in neuroimmunology, neurology, hematology, and autoimmune disorders. His lab at the Salk Institute continues to lead the field in understanding how chemical additions to proteins control the cell cycle and growth, leading to new potential therapeutic targets for cancers.

An independent committee of world-renowned scientists selected Dr. Hunter for this recognition. He joins 25 other scientists who have received the Dr. Paul Janssen Award since 2004, including ten who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.

""Dr. Hunter's work stood out to the selection committee for its foundational impact in addressing one of the most pressing medical questions of our generation: Why do cancers thrive, and how do we stop them from growing? His discoveries have already made a great impact, and they continue to pave the way for new innovations in cancer therapies, improving outcomes for patients worldwide,"" said Elaine Fuchs, Ph.D., Selection Committee Chair for the Dr. Paul Janssen Award. ""As in every year, we had an impressive slate of researchers nominated for their exceptional work in the field of biomedical research.""

Johnson & Johnson will honor Dr. Hunter during a virtual symposium, cohosted with The New York Academy of Sciences on March 2, 2026. The symposium is free to anyone interested in celebrating scientific innovation. (Registration is required.)

""I am delighted to receive the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research,"" Hunter said. ""I discovered tyrosine phosphorylation as a cancer mechanism while carrying out studies with a simple chicken tumor virus, hoping our findings would give us clues as to how human cancer develops. This serendipitous discovery led to a whole new class of cancer drugs and underscores the importance of funding for basic biomedical research, which can lead to other breakthrough cancer treatments.""

The Dr. Paul Janssen Award builds on Dr. Hunter's extensive list of international scientific awards and recognitions, including the AACR Lifetime Achievement Award in Cancer Research, the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Sjöberg Prize, among others.

In its decision letter, the agency acknowledges the controlled clinical trials submitted by Vanda demonstrates positive efficacy signals.
Following the legal proceeding, in October 2025, the agency and Vanda agreed to a re-review of its supplemental new drug application (NDA) conducted under a collaborative framework agreement between the two parties.
Under the agreement, the agency committed to an expedited re-review of the application by January 7, 2026, including considerations of narrower, sleep-focused indications.
Vanda maintains that its submission met the statutory standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness on clinically relevant endpoints for jet lag disorder.","Vanda Pharmaceuticals announced it received a decision letter from the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) stating that the supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) for Hetlioz (tasimelteon) for the treatment of jet lag disorder cannot be approved in its current form.

In its decision letter, the agency acknowledges the controlled clinical trials submitted by Vanda demonstrates positive efficacy signals. However, FDA determined that the data did not constitute substantial evidence of effectiveness for jet lag disorder.1

The decision comes against the backdrop of previous legal proceedings, as in August 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside FDA’s earlier refusal to approve of Hetlioz for jet lag disorder. The court characterized Vanda’s evidence as “specific, reasoned, and rooted in evidence,” while labeling the FDA’s earlier review as “cursory,” noting statistically significant improvements on primary endpoints across trials.

Following the legal proceeding, in October 2025, the agency and Vanda agreed to a re-review of its supplemental new drug application (NDA) conducted under a collaborative framework agreement between the two parties. Under the agreement, the agency committed to an expedited re-review of the application by January 7, 2026, including considerations of narrower, sleep-focused indications.

How did FDA come to its decision?

FDA based its conclusion on its assessment of the controlled phase advance protocols used in the studies, specifically five-hour and eight-hour shifts in bedtime, claiming the shifts do not sufficiently reflect real-world jet travel.1 The agency cited several aspects associated with air travel, such as reduced cabin pressure, physical constraints, noise, and lighting changes, as elements not captured by the study designs.1

Vanda continues to dispute FDA’s interpretation, highlighting the widespread use of phase advance models in circadian rhythm research as established methods for simulating the core biological misalignment associated with eastward jet lag.1 The company has maintained its stance, saying that the models isolate circadian disruption without introducing additional variables related to travel conditions. The company also cited data from studies involving both simulated protocols and actual transatlantic travel, saying the data demonstrates improvements in sleep duration, time to persistent sleep, and next-day alertness.1

The company further noted that Hetlioz has an established safety profile which is supported by more than a decade of market experience in its approved chronic indications, including adverse events described as predominantly mild.

Vanda maintains that its submission met the statutory standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness on clinically relevant endpoints for jet lag disorder.

Although Vanda stated that it welcomed FDA’s engagement during the re-review process, the company does not believe the latest decision fully reflects the court’s concerns regarding engagement with the evidence, with Vanda saying it intends to continue discussions with the agency while considering additional steps related to the application.1This includes the company saying it will “pursue all appropriate avenues” in order to advance the approval of Hetlioz.

The company got into the space early, focusing the design of its chips to suit this technology, and that's resulted in a No. 1 position in the market. As a result, Nvidia's revenue has soared, and the stock price has followed as investors rushed to get in on this success story. Nvidia shares have advanced 1,100% over the past three years.

Though this picture is bright, investors still look expectantly to Nvidia for signs of what's next -- and what may keep the revenue momentum going. After all, the company isn't alone in this dynamic space. It faces mounting competition from rivals such as Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. And it even faces the possibility that customers such as Alphabet will rely more heavily on their in-house designed chips and buy fewer Nvidia products down the road.

Just this week, Nvidia chief Jensen Huang spoke at the consumer electronics event known as CES, a forum for product announcements and innovation updates, and he offered a clear picture of what's ahead for the company. In fact, Huang delivered brilliant news to Nvidia investors for 2026.

Nvidia's promise

First, though, it's important to take a quick look at the Nvidia story so far and a promise the company has made to customers and investors. As mentioned, Nvidia was first to market with its graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI, and this helped the company establish leadership. These GPUs drive the critical steps needed to get the AI show on the road, from the training of models to putting them to work.

Nvidia didn't stop there and instead added a wide selection of related products and services to its repertoire -- and that has made it a source that customers can turn to for any of their AI needs. The company also has been proactive, designing platforms in areas such as robotics to drive the AI developments of the future.

At the same time, Nvidia made a promise several quarters ago to those depending on it for technology and growth. The company pledged to update its GPUs on an annual basis, and it's followed through on that with the launch of the Blackwell architecture in late 2024 and then the Blackwell Ultra update last year. Both products met with enormous demand, generating billions of dollars for Nvidia.

Jensen Huang at CES

And this brings me to Huang's announcement at CES. It's as simple as this: The company's Rubin platform is in full production. That puts this next update on track for release this year, once again fulfilling Nvidia's promise. Rubin features five innovations, including the latest NVLink communications link and the Vera central processing unit (CPU). (CPUs are the main chips that power computers.)

But this isn't the only chip involved. In fact, Rubin includes six chips all designed together, in a process called ""extreme codesign"" -- and this has resulted in tremendous gains in efficiency. This integration of chips allows Rubin to offer benefits such as reducing inference token costs by as much as 10 times, and its switch systems help Rubin to offer major improvements in power efficiency and uptime.

So, this platform sounds solid -- but why is this announcement such fantastic news right now? There are three reasons. First, it's yet another example of Nvidia keeping its word and demonstrating that it can innovate and launch a major product on an annual basis. Second, innovations are key because they are what should keep Nvidia in its leadership position. It will be very difficult for a rival to beat Nvidia when new launches happen once a year.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849808%2Fgettyimages-1335027284.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-08 20:02:00.823286

With the docking of Mt New Renown, which has a total cargo capacity of 3.3 lakh m3 (meter cube), Mundra became the first port in India to handle Fully Laden VLCC at Berth, the Adani Group company said in a statement.

The handling of Mt New Renown was executed under challenging conditions with strong currents, winds and sea states, showcasing expertise, coordination and operational excellence of the APSEZ marine team and port management.

Mundra’s VLCC jetty is seamlessly connected via a 489 km crude oil pipeline to the HPCL Rajasthan Refinery at Barmer — one of India’s most strategic refining assets.

This direct connectivity significantly enhances India’s energy security; efficiency of large-scale crude imports; supply chain resilience; and regional economic growth across Gujarat and Rajasthan.

With this achievement, Mundra Port is now among select global crude handling hubs, strengthening India’s position in the global maritime and energy map. Mundra’s advanced vessel-handling capability eliminates dependency on offshore Single Point Moorings (SPMs) or lightering operations that were traditionally used for such large vessels, said the company.

“This development also highlights Mundra’s significance as the first port in the country and among a select few in the world to have a dedicated jetty capable of directly berthing fully laden VLCCs,” it added.

Mundra Port features 27 operational berths and two Single Point Moorings (SPMs); capability to handle dry bulk, break-bulk, project cargo, liquids, containers, automobiles, and crude oil and accommodation of Cape size vessels, VLCCs and Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCCs) and ultra large container vessels (ULCVs).

Mundra became the first port in India to handle over 200 million metric tonnes (MMT) of cargo in a single year in 2024-25, reinforcing its unmatched scale and operational leadership.

Eli Lilly stands out as a case with the potential to fundamentally alter the landscape of wage-and-hour collective actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).[1] At issue is a deceptively simple but deeply consequential question: What must a plaintiff show before a federal court may authorize notice to other employees in a collective action under FLSA § 216(b)?

The Court is scheduled to consider the employer’s Petition at conference this Friday. A grant of certiorari could signal its readiness to address a three-way circuit split that has only deepened in recent years, and to clarify a procedural regime that, for decades, has evolved largely through lower-court innovation unmoored to the FLSA’s text and without any Supreme Court guidance.

This alert summarizes the Supreme Court filings and assesses why the Court’s odds of taking up the case are higher than in an average cert petition.

Why Richards Is on the Supreme Court’s Radar

The FLSA’s collective-action mechanism is unique in federal law. Section 216(b) allows employees to sue on behalf of others who are “similarly situated,” but—unlike Rule 23 class actions—requires affirmative opt-in. The statute is silent on when and how courts should determine similarity, what evidentiary showing is required, and how much scrutiny should occur before court-authorized notice issues.

This statutory silence has produced a fractured legal landscape. That’s why the question presented in Richards is procedural but pivotal: What evidentiary standard governs a district court’s decision to authorize notice to putative collective members under § 216(b)? Lower courts have adopted at least four divergent approaches:

Lenient “modest showing” standard traditionally derived from Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. (D.N.J. 1987),

Fifth Circuit’s preponderance-of-the-evidence standard in Swales v. KLLM Transport Services (2021),

Sixth Circuit’s “strong likelihood” standard in Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC (2023),

Seventh Circuit’s “material factual dispute” standard in Richards v. Eli Lilly (2025).

These approaches differ not only in name but in substance. Some require meaningful discovery and early adjudication of contested facts, while others allow notice on largely untested allegations in a rubber-stamp approach to notice. The inconsistency affects litigation risk, discovery burdens, and settlement incentives for employers nationwide.[2]

Richards arrives at a moment when the tensions between the circuits’ varying approaches are impossible to ignore, and the Supreme Court’s intervention could bring long-overdue clarity.

The FLSA Issues Teed Up for Review

Is Court-Authorized Notice a Meaningful Judicial Act—or a Ministerial Step?

Eli Lilly’s petition argues that authorizing notice is not a neutral or inconsequential act. Once a trial court authorizes notice to putative members of the collective, wage and hour lawsuits often expand dramatically, discovery costs soar, and settlement pressure intensifies. The Petition challenges the Lusardi premise that notice can be issued on minimal evidence because it is “preliminary,” and urges the Court to treat notice as a meaningful judicial act requiring rigorous analysis.

What Does “Similarly Situated” Require—And When?

The circuits disagree not only on how much evidence is required, but also on when similarity must be evaluated:

Fifth Circuit: Requires courts to resolve similarity before notice by a preponderance of the evidence.

Sixth Circuit: Demands a “strong likelihood” of similarity.

Seventh Circuit: Adopts a “material factual dispute” standard, allowing more discretion.

Each standard reflects a fundamentally different view of § 216(b): Is similarity a threshold gatekeeping requirement, or can it be postponed until after notice has already reshaped the litigation?

How Much Discretion Should District Courts Have?

Richards’ opposition brief emphasizes district court discretion and argues that variability is a feature, not a flaw. Eli Lilly and its amici, by contrast, frame unfettered discretion as the problem—arguing that without a uniform rule, outcomes depend more on geography than law.

The Supreme Court Filings: A National Debate

Eli Lilly’s Petition for Certiorari frames Richards as an opportunity to address foundational questions about the role of courts in FLSA collective actions. The employer argues for clarifying the implications that arise from Hoffmann-La Roche or, at minimum, requiring rigorous proof of similarity before notice. In response, Richards defends the Seventh Circuit’s “middle-ground” approach as reasonable and consistent with congressional intent.

The parties to the case are not the only ones who have voiced their arguments in favor and in opposition to certiorari. One of the most significant developments at the cert-stage is the sheer number and nature of the amicus briefs supporting review. Six separate amicus briefs have been filed in support of the petition. These briefs come from a diverse array of stakeholders including major business trade associations, employer groups, and public policy organizations across the country.

Among the six amicus briefs supporting Eli Lilly, the brief filed by the State of Ohio—joined by 19 other states and the Arizona Legislature—stands out. The 20 states made several important points in favor of granting Eli Lilly’s Petition:

Sovereign and Fiscal Impact: The brief emphasizes that states, as large employers, are increasingly targeted by FLSA collective actions. The amici argue that the current regime—where courts can authorize notice to non-parties based on minimal evidence—imposes “steep costs” on state treasuries and undermines states’ ability to govern their workforces.

Constitutional Concerns: The brief contends that court-facilitated notice to non-parties exceeds the traditional bounds of judicial power under Article III, as it invites individuals who are not yet parties into litigation, contrary to the adversarial model.

Statutory Silence: The amici highlight that neither the FLSA nor the ADEA authorizes courts to recruit new plaintiffs, and that the judicially created notice regime is untethered from statutory text or historical practice.

Patchwork Standards and Forum-shopping: The brief underscores the practical problems caused by the circuit split, noting that the lack of a uniform standard encourages forum-shopping and creates unpredictability for employers nationwide.

The amici urge the Court to adopt a clear, rigorous standard for notice that protects both public and private employers from the burdens of overbroad collective actions.

Why the Certiorari Posture Is Unusually Strong

Estimating certiorari odds is inherently speculative, but several predictors of Supreme Court review that serve as useful guideposts are present here:

Deep, Acknowledged Circuit Split: At least three courts of appeals have adopted distinct and incompatible standards, and the Seventh Circuit expressly declined to follow either of the others. The result is a patchwork regime that virtually invites forum-shopping.

Significant Amicus Engagement: Six amicus briefs at the cert stage—particularly in a procedural employment case—signal broad national importance. The Ohio-led brief, joined by South Carolina and other states, highlights the issue’s impact on public sector employers.

Squarely Presented Legal Question: The opposition brief defends the Seventh Circuit’s rule on the merits, confirming that the legal question is squarely presented and vigorously contested.

Beyond the merits presented by the Petition, Richards aligns with the Court’s broader institutional priorities. For example, the Court has shown increasing interest in ensuring that procedural shortcuts do not effectively determine case outcomes. The Court has also reinforced the importance of text, structure, and historical practice in interpreting the role and authority of the courts, a factor that weighs in favor of a narrow construction of the collective-action mechanism of § 216. And if those fail, the Court has shown an interest in creating uniform federal procedure to limit forum-shopping incentivized by the current three-way split, which undermines predictability for employers and employees alike.

What to Watch Going Forward

If the Court grants certiorari, Richards could become the most significant FLSA procedural decision since Hoffmann-La Roche. The Court could:

Clarify Hoffmann-La Roche: Eliminating court-facilitated notice would fundamentally reshape FLSA collective actions.

Adopt a Uniform, Heightened Standard: Requiring plaintiffs to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence (or a “strong likelihood”), that others are similarly situated before notice issues.

Endorse the Seventh Circuit’s Middle-Ground Approach: Allowing for more judicial discretion but requiring consideration of both sides’ evidence.

Maintain the Status Quo: Leaving the current forum-dependent landscape—and its attendant risks—in place.

For employers, the stakes are high: A Supreme Court decision could recalibrate early-stage leverage in collective actions, reshape notice practices nationwide, and provide long-overdue clarity on the meaning of “similarly situated” under § 216(b). The case is worth close attention not because it guarantees a particular outcome, but because it presents the Court with a clean vehicle to impose order on an increasingly fractured area of wage-and-hour law.

Conclusion

Richards v. Eli Lilly is not just another employment dispute—it is a strong candidate for review. The combination of a three-way circuit split, significant amicus engagement, and a fundamental disagreement over how courts should administer a core federal statute makes this case one to watch closely as the Court shapes its 2026 docket.

If the Court is looking for an opportunity to bring coherence to FLSA collective actions, Richards is it.

“Every job we’ve got is going to change in some way — whether it’s getting the shopping carts off the parking lot, or the way our technologists work, or certainly the way leadership roles change,” McMillon said during a Harvard Business Review event in November, according to an Axios report from that day.

That statement came toward the end of a big year for Walmart’s AI endeavors, which already stretched across its operations from online and omnichannel shopping to how its employees work at stores and build internal tools to benefit the organization. In addition to developing its own AI and machine learning capabilities, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company also works with OpenAI in key areas that factor into its plans for 2026.

How Walmart is using AI for its agents and ‘super agents’

Suresh Kumar, the global chief technology officer and chief development officer at Walmart, used the phrase “super agents” to describe how Walmart is using AI not just to enhance customer service and experience, but also to manage lesser AI agents in targeted areas with larger agents that operate at higher levels.

“We’ve been building agents — fast — for every aspect of the business,” he wrote in a July 2025 LinkedIn post.

Walmart gave those super agents their own names:

Sparky, which is Walmart’s virtual assistant for shoppers.

My Assistant, a tool that Walmart associates use for tasks ranging from scheduling meetings to engaging with data sets.

Marty, which assists Walmart partners and will play an increasing role in advertising.

WIBEY, a super agent designed to help Walmart developers.

In addition, Walmart created a generative AI-powered assistant named Wally, which it built to aid employees with merchandising tasks.

What is ChatGPT’s role in agentic commerce for Walmart?

At the beginning of the 2025 holiday shopping season, Walmart announced a major expansion of its work with OpenAI, which Walmart called “agentic commerce in action.” Previously, Walmart detailed that it would collaborate with OpenAI on certification and training through the Walmart Academy program. In the latest partnership, consumers can purchase Walmart products within OpenAI’s ChatGPT experience.

That functionality includes the use of ChatGPT’s “instant checkout” experience for completing purchases. Walmart followed early adopters Etsy and Shopify to begin making use of the option.

Internal AI resources

Even as a super agent, WIBEY was built on top of Element, which is Walmart’s proprietary machine learning platform. Designed to use Kubernetes, Walmart uses Element to support technology deployments across multiple cloud-based contexts, as well as for hardware-accelerated experiments and integrations with enterprise services.

“Element is purpose-built to support the full lifecycle of intelligent workflows, from experimentation to production at scale,” wrote Sravana Karnati, executive vice president of global technology platforms at Walmart Global Tech, in an August 2025 blog post. “Designed for distributed, scalable, and production-ready AI, Element simplifies infrastructure, accelerates development, and empowers teams to focus on delivering impact.”

The scope of these efforts speaks to multiple layers of technology that a company the size of Walmart is able to use, as well as the wide reach those systems have across its various divisions.

Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

In this scenario, the stock price is set up to rebound sharply and could do so at any time.
Before you consider Albertsons Companies, you'll want to hear this.
While Albertsons Companies currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","Albertsons Companies NYSE: ACI presents a compelling value proposition in 2026, but the question is whether it is an opportunity for investors, and the signs suggest it is. While price action is bearish, results are outperforming expectations, and stock accumulation is underway. The company’s Q3 earnings report highlights continued outperformance versus expectations, reinforcing the bullish case despite bearish price action.

It is only a matter of time before this stock price reconnects with reality, and when it does, the gains that follow could be explosive. Semi-explosive, at least.

This isn’t exactly a high-growth story. We’re talking about a value-and-yield combination that suggests a high double-digit total return by the end of 2026 and the potential for a sustained rally as growth is reinvigorated.

Albertsons Presents a Favorable Value-and-Yield Combination

On a value basis, Albertsons trades at only 8x its current-year earnings outlook and 6x the 2030 consensus forecast, a discount relative to its peers every way you look at it. There are not many publicly traded direct competitors; Kroger NYSE: KR is number one, and Albertsons is number two. Kroger, the larger of the two, trades at 12x this year’s earnings and 10x the 2030 consensus, suggesting a minimum 50% upside is possible for ACI stock. Other comparisons, including those with regional player Ingles Markets NASDAQ: IMKTA and big-box stores such as Walmart NASDAQ: WMT and Costco NASDAQ: COST, reveal even more favorable valuations.

Thedividend yield heightens the value. Albertsons pays a reliable 60 cents as of early 2026, yielding approximately 3.5%, compared to a competitor range that tops out under 3%. The highest-yielding competitor is regional grocer Village Super Markets; the critical comparison is to Kroger, which yields about 2.25% with a similar payout ratio. Albertsons' dividend payout is under 30% of the fiscal year 2025 (FY2025) earnings consensus, according to MarketBeat, and the company has exceeded its targets every quarter so far.

Value and yield are among the reasons why the institutions accumulated in 2025. The data reveals mixed activity in Q4, with selling outpacing buying ever so slightly, but bullish behavior for the year. Institutions bought on balance each quarter at a pace of approximately $3 for each $1 sold and are likely to continue accumulating in 2026. The forecast is for this company to sustain its modest growth pace and to widen margins.

Tepid Guidance Sends ACI Shares to New Lows

Albertsons' Q4 FY2025 guidance fell short of the consensus, sending shares to new lows. However, the guidance adjustment merely narrowed the range, forecasting a mid-point slightly below the consensus. The takeaway is that growth is expected, including earnings, sustaining the capital return outlook. Data in the report also reveals strengths, including in comparable sales, digital channels, and loyalty, which underpin growth across the retail universe. The likely outcome is that Q4 guidance is cautious, and that a catalyst for a rebound may emerge before mid-year.

Catalysts in 2026 include the company’s strategic shift, increased loyalty engagement, and improved clarity now that the Kroger merger issues are behind it. The strategic shift focuses on digital, specifically its retail media network, which helps the grocery company leverage its growing loyalty base. The retail media network enables the company to sell ad space on its websites and apps, targeting specific shoppers and is a higher-margin business.

Albertsons Stock Overextends After Q3 Release

Albertsons' stock price has been under pressure for many quarters and is overextended in early 2026. Both the MACD and stochastic indicators reflect significant divergences, suggesting that a lack of buyers, rather than a dearth of sellers, is driving the market. In this scenario, the stock price is set up to rebound sharply and could do so at any time. The risk is that ACI stock will continue to drift lower until later in the year when more news is available. In that scenario, it could move to the post-IPO lows near $14 before rebounding.

It remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen.","Recession fears have cooled off in recent months as the US economy continues to prove resilient (did you see that GDP number?) and the Federal Reserve slashes interest rates.

But a labor market chart flagged by one bearish strategist on Tuesday might give investors pause.

The chart, shared in a client note from Société Générale's Albert Edwards, shows the US unemployment rate (in red) alongside its three-year moving average (dotted line). Since 1950, in eight instances where the unemployment rate has begun an uptrend and broken through its three-year moving average, a recession has followed.

""Recession is the biggest threat to equities, although in recent downturns financial problems have preceded (or caused) recessions,"" Edwards wrote in the note. ""I don't think any guru is forecasting a recession in 2026. Yet the simple correlation shown below has a 100% track record of success.""

The chart mirrors the concept of the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator, which says that the US economy is in a recession when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by more than 0.5% from its lows over the previous 12 months. In other words, if unemployment rises too quickly, it signals that things are about to get worse.

Although it had been hailed for its back-tested accuracy since its release in 2019, the gauge produced its first false reading in August 2024.

It remains to be seen if the labor market weakens materially, as Edwards' chart suggests could happen. Hiring rates and job openings remain sluggish. But other important measures of the economy's health — like consumer spending and GDP growth — remain strong.

Another signal that a recession could be on the way, according to Edwards, is a steepening of the Treasury yield curve following its inversion. However, while falling short-term rates following an inversion are usually accompanied by a floundering job market and consumer, today's economy seems to be in a stronger starting place.",https://i.insider.com/695ec1f064858d02d217f102?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 17:14:24.815320

Underlying Equity","You will find a link to the accompanying preliminary pricing supplement for the securities above and links to the accompanying product supplement and accompanying prospectus for the securities under “Additional Information About UBS and the Securities” in the preliminary pricing supplement, which you should read and understand prior to investing in the securities.

The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus as supplemented by a product supplement and the preliminary pricing supplement) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the accompanying prospectus in that registration statement and the other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC, including the accompanying preliminary pricing supplement and the accompanying product supplement, for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the issuer, any underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-833-653-0401. Our Central Index Key, or CIK, on the SEC web site is 0001114446.

Risk Considerations

The risks set forth below are discussed in more detail in the “Risk Factors” section in the preliminary pricing supplement. Please review those risk factors carefully prior to making an investment decision.

Risks Relating to Return Characteristics

▪The securities do not guarantee the return of any principal and your investment in the securities may result in a loss.

▪The contingent payment, if any, is based solely on the closing prices of the underlying equity on the specified determination dates.

▪You will not receive any contingent payment for any period where the closing price of the underlying equity on the determination date is less than the downside threshold level.

▪Higher contingent payments are generally associated with a greater risk of loss.

▪Early redemption risk.

▪Investors will not participate in any appreciation in the closing price of the underlying equity and will not have the same rights as holders of the underlying equity.

Risks Relating to Characteristics of the Underlying Equity

▪Single equity risk.

▪There can be no assurance that the investment view implicit in the securities will be successful.

▪No affiliation with the underlying equity issuer.

Estimated Value Considerations

▪The issue price you pay for the securities will exceed their estimated initial value.

▪The estimated initial value is a theoretical price and the actual price that you may be able to sell your securities in any secondary market (if any) at any time after the pricing date may differ from the estimated initial value.

▪Our actual profits may be greater or less than the differential between the estimated initial value and the issue price of the securities as of the pricing date.

Risks Relating to Liquidity and Secondary Market Price Considerations

▪There may be little or no secondary market for the securities.

▪The price at which UBS Securities LLC and its affiliates may offer to buy the securities in the secondary market (if any) may be greater than UBS’ valuation of the securities at that time, greater than any other secondary market prices provided by unaffiliated dealers (if any) and, depending on your broker, greater than the valuation provided on your customer account statements.

▪Price of securities prior to maturity.

▪Impact of fees and the use of internal funding rates rather than secondary market credit spreads on secondary market prices.

Risks Relating to Hedging Activities and Conflicts of Interest

▪Potential conflicts of interest.

▪Hedging and trading activities by the calculation agent and its affiliates could potentially affect the value of, and any amounts payable on, the securities.

▪We may engage in business with or involving the underlying equity issuer without regard to your interests.

▪Potential UBS impact on an underlying equity.

▪Following certain events, the calculation agent can make adjustments to the underlying equity and terms of the securities that may adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the securities.

Risks Relating to General Credit Characteristics

▪The securities are subject to the credit risk of UBS, and any actual or anticipated changes to our credit ratings or credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the securities.

▪The securities are not bank deposits.

▪If UBS experiences financial difficulties, FINMA has the power to open restructuring or liquidation proceedings in respect of, and/or impose protective measures in relation to, UBS, which proceedings or measures may have a material adverse effect on the terms and market value of the securities and/or the ability of UBS to make payments thereunder.

Risks Relating to U.S. Federal Income Taxation

▪Uncertain tax treatment. Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” in the preliminary pricing supplement and “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”, including the section “— Securities Treated as Prepaid Derivatives or Prepaid Forwards with Associated Contingent Coupons”, in the accompanying product supplement.

Spark’s Take on MPB Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, MPB is a Outperform.

The score is driven primarily by solid financial health (notably low leverage and healthy profitability) and supportive valuation (moderate P/E with a solid dividend yield). Corporate events add upside from strategic acquisitions, while technical indicators are mixed with near-term softness and weak momentum signals.

Trial to resolve all claims in the Anaptys and Tesaro/GSK dispute is scheduled for July 14-17, 2026

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 08, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AnaptysBio, Inc. (Nasdaq: ANAB), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative immunology therapeutics, filed a partial motion to dismiss Tesaro’s anticipatory breach of contract claim in Delaware Chancery Court related to pending litigation between Anaptys, GSK, and TESARO, Inc. (“Tesaro”) regarding their Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”), which entitles Anaptys to receive royalties upon sales of Jemperli .

As previously disclosed, Anaptys approached Tesaro to engage in good faith discussions to potentially resolve Anaptys’ claims that Tesaro and GSK had breached the Collaboration Agreement. On Nov. 20, 2025, Tesaro, without notice to Anaptys and with discussions ongoing, initiated a lawsuit against Anaptys, claiming that Anaptys had repudiated the Collaboration Agreement and seeking a declaration that Tesaro had not breached.

In response, Anaptys filed its own Complaint in Delaware Chancery Court, requesting a court declaration that Tesaro has materially breached the parties’ Collaboration Agreement and that GSK, Tesaro’s corporate parent, has tortiously interfered with the Collaboration Agreement.

Further, on Dec. 30, 2025, Anaptys filed a Motion to Dismiss Tesaro’s anticipatory breach of contract claim in the same court. The motion, unsealed on Jan. 8, 2026, explains why, as a matter of law, Anaptys has never repudiated the Collaboration Agreement and how Anaptys has only sought to vindicate its contract rights (which cannot be a repudiation). Anaptys’ motion also explains why Delaware’s anti-SLAPP law applies, as the law exists to prevent strategic lawsuits aimed at deterring good‑faith efforts to assert legal rights, such as Tesaro’s lawsuit.

Tesaro and GSK contend that Anaptys’ Motion to Dismiss stays all discovery, a contention that Anaptys strongly opposes as the two companies work toward the scheduled July 14-17 trial date. The court is expected to hear Anaptys’ Motion to Dismiss by early March pursuant to Delaware’s anti-SLAPP law.

About Anaptys’ Collaboration and Exclusive License Agreement with Tesaro (an affiliate of GSK)

In March 2014, Anaptys entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Tesaro, an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company now a part of GSK. Currently, under the Collaboration Agreement, Tesaro is developing Jemperli (dostarlimab) as a monotherapy, and in combination with additional therapies, for various solid tumor indications.

Anaptys is eligible to receive royalties upon sales of Jemperli , equal to 8% of net sales below $1.0 billion, 12% of net sales between $1.0 billion and $1.5 billion, 20% of net sales between $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion and 25% of net sales above $2.5 billion.

The royalty term under this collaboration extends at least through expiration of composition of matter coverage on the molecule which expires in 2035 in the U.S. and in 2036 in the EU.

About Anaptys

Anaptys is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative immunology therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The company’s pipeline includes rosnilimab, a pathogenic T cell depleter, which has completed a Phase 2b trial for rheumatoid arthritis; ANB033, a CD122 antagonist, in a Phase 1b trial for celiac disease with plans to expand development into an additional indication; and ANB101, a BDCA2 modulator, in a Phase 1a trial. Anaptys has also discovered and out-licensed in financial collaborations multiple therapeutic antibodies, including a PD-1 antagonist ( Jemperli (dostarlimab-gxly)) to GSK and an IL-36R antagonist (imsidolimab) to Vanda Pharmaceuticals.

Tech-Powered Approach

Walmart said Shishir Mehrotra, Chief Executive Officer at Superhuman, formerly Grammarly, will serve on the Board’s Compensation and Management Development Committee and the Technology and eCommerce Committee.

“Our focus remains on serving customers through a people-led, tech-powered approach. Shishir’s background adds to our boardroom the insight of a proven builder, offering a distinguished track record scaling platforms relied upon by millions,” said Greg Penner, Chairman, Walmart Board of Directors.

Over the last 12 months, Walmart has embraced the AI and technological revolution. This includes developing its GenAI chatbot Sparky, which helps customers plan their purchases, and a partnership with OpenAI.

That deal aims to bring AI into more parts of its retail experience. Now, customers can shop at Walmart through ChatGPT by using a new feature called Instant Checkout.

It has also moved its listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the more tech-heavy Nasdaq.

Kumthekar A, Ogdie A. Obesity and Psoriatic Arthritis: A Narrative Review.","Eli Lilly and Company has announced positive topline results from the TOGETHER-PsA trial, a first-of-its-kind phase 3b study evaluating the concomitant use of the IL-17A inhibitor ixekizumab (Taltz) and the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide (Zepbound) in adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who also have obesity or overweight with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity.1 These new results suggest that an integrated pharmacologic approach targeting both inflammatory disease activity and excess body weight can deliver superior clinical outcomes compared with biologic therapy alone.

Background

Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease associated with progressive joint damage, functional impairment, and a substantial burden of comorbidities. Obesity is highly prevalent among patients with PsA, affecting an estimated 65% of adults in the United States, and is increasingly recognized as a modifier of disease severity, treatment response, and long-term outcomes.2 Despite guideline recommendations to address obesity in PsA management, weight reduction and inflammatory control are typically treated separately in clinical practice.

Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits interleukin-17A, a key cytokine involved in psoriatic inflammation, and is approved for the treatment of PsA, plaque psoriasis, and axial spondyloarthritis. Tirzepatide is the only FDA-approved dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for obesity management and has demonstrated robust and sustained weight loss across multiple clinical programs.

Study Design

TOGETHER-PsA was designed to directly test whether concomitant pharmacologic treatment of obesity could enhance PsA outcomes. The 52-week, randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, open-label study enrolled 271 adult patients with active PsA and a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², or BMI 27–29.9 kg/m² with at least 1 weight-related comorbidity. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive subcutaneous ixekizumab alone or in combination with tirzepatide. All patients received standardized counseling on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, ensuring that observed differences reflected pharmacologic effects.

Results

At the 36-week analysis, the study met its primary endpoint, defined as the proportion of participants achieving both a 50% improvement in PsA disease activity, measured by the American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) response, and at least 10% body weight reduction. In the combination arm, 31.7% of patients met this composite endpoint, compared with only 0.8% of patients treated with ixekizumab monotherapy (p < 0.001).

Key secondary endpoints further supported the superiority of the combination regimen. Notably, 33.5% of patients receiving ixekizumab plus tirzepatide achieved an ACR50 response at week 36, compared with 20.4% in the ixekizumab arm, representing a 64% relative increase in response rate (p < 0.05). This improvement in joint and systemic inflammation occurred in a population with high baseline disease burden, including high disease activity, meaningful functional impairment, and an average BMI of 37.6 kg/m². More than 60% of participants had previously been treated with one or more advanced therapies, underscoring the refractory nature of the study population.

Safety Profile

Safety outcomes in TOGETHER-PsA were consistent with the known profiles of both agents. Adverse events in the combination arm were generally mild to moderate. The most common events occurring in at least 5% of patients included gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as injection site reactions. In the ixekizumab monotherapy arm, injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections were most commonly reported. No new safety signals were identified with concomitant use.

Clinical Implications

From a dermatologic perspective, these findings are particularly relevant, as skin disease and systemic inflammation in psoriatic disease are closely linked to metabolic dysfunction. The findings suggest that obesity may act not only as a comorbidity but also as a modifiable driver of inflammatory disease activity in PsA. Detailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and regulatory discussions are planned.

""While treatment guidelines for psoriatic arthritis recommend management of obesity, the reality is these two chronic diseases are often addressed separately and moving the needle in psoriatic arthritis has remained challenging,"" said Joseph F. Merola, MD, Professor and Chair of the Department of Dermatology and Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Rheumatic Diseases at UT Southwestern Medical Center. ""The observed benefit with treatment using Taltz and Zepbound appears to meaningfully impact psoriatic disease activity, indicating that for many patients, PsA is an obesity-related condition. This integrated therapy approach represents a potential paradigm shift and could lead to better outcomes for those living with both diseases.""1

Ensure architecture can ingest new metrics (emissions, safety alerts, etc.)","Regulatory pressure has long shaped the terrain in logistics, from emissions limits, to hours of service (HOS), to safety mandates. Today, that terrain is rapidly changing and the view from the windshield is foggy. Pressure has intensified in recent years, driving innovation across fleet design, yard operations, data systems, and autonomous tooling. At the same time, the industry is navigating politically driven regulatory rollbacks that introduce an additional level of complexity.

Logistics managers have no choice but to adapt. Here are key domains to watch and a strategic playbook for staying ahead of disruption.

Policy: The invisible hand behind innovation

Regulatory and policy incentives have a profound influence on logistics trends and innovations. These forces influence where capital flows, which technologies scale fastest, and which legacy practices persist.

Regulators have long treated transportation and logistics as a focus area for environmental protection and improvement, as these sectors account for a disproportionate share of emissions. In a recent example, the EPA’s “Clean Trucks Plan” set ambitious nitrous oxide and greenhouse gas (GHG) limits for model years 2027-2032 to cut emissions per ton-mile by up to 60%.

Safety targets are likewise tightening and, in turn, shaping capital planning for logistics leaders and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). For example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) recently proposed a rule requiring new vehicles with a gross vehicle weight exceeding 10,000 lb. to be equipped with automatic emergency braking (AEB) systems to reduce the frequency and severity of rear-end collisions.

However, while safety regulations continue to strengthen, environmental rules now face an uncertain future, leaving logistics managers uncertain about their next steps. The current administration is proposing to unravel GHG Phase 3 standards, rescind the Clean Air Act’s endangerment finding (which underpins federal climate regulation), and revoke GHG mandates for light, medium, and heavy vehicles. In parallel, the administration has nullified rules that permitted California’s more stringent emissions regimes, such as the zero-emission Class 8 truck mandates and heavy-duty nitrous oxide rules, citing regulatory overreach. California’s government responded with a lawsuit and orders for new CARB standards.

Though regulatory rollbacks may scale back updates, don’t expect to see a full reversal. For example, OEMs were preparing for 25-40% of new Class 8 trucks to be zero-emission by 2032, and engineering roadmaps are already in motion.

Questions are also emerging around legacy size and weight limits. The long-standing federal weight limit sits at 80,000 pounds, which effectively caps most loads at roughly 45,000 pound of product. Meanwhile, trailers are 53 feet long today, compared to 48 feet a couple of decades ago. Increasing automation could open the door to new configurations: longer, denser, or modular trailer formats designed to optimize payload, aerodynamics, and autonomous system performance. It may not be long before we see regulators revisit size and weight rules to account for safer, more predictable automated driving systems.

A playbook for navigating uncertainty

Despite uncertainty, the upshot of a softening of enforcement intensity is that fleets may gain some breathing room in capital planning. In the near term, these rollbacks alleviate pressure on fleets that were bracing for a pre-2027 buying surge, formerly anticipated due to strict emissions deadlines. That surge may no longer materialize, bursting a distorting bubble in truck orders.

However, fleet managers cannot defer safety investments, such as collision-avoidance systems, telematics, and driver-assist technology. The dual dynamic of emissions flexibility and safety expectations will require planning agility.

Expect to see gradual, targeted deployment of improvements rather than wholesale fleet conversion. Leading operators will build simulations of their logistics networks, monitoring route shifts, demand disruptions, energy constraints, and new policy regimes. Electric vehicles will gain traction in yards, regional lanes, and controlled operations where charging can be assured. Advanced driver-assistance systems will continue to proliferate, with automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping assistance, and driver monitoring expanding in high-risk corridors.

Given the push-pull of market, investor, and regulatory forces, how can logistics leaders navigate the bumpy road ahead? Here’s a strategic roadmap to follow:

● Conduct policy scenario planning. Build alternate futures based on tight, relaxed, or mixed regulations, and stress test investment plans against each.

● Invest in data abstraction. Ensure architecture can ingest new metrics (emissions, safety alerts, etc.) for fast pivots if regulatory targets shift.

● Choose modular deployment. Begin with low-regret zones (yards, regional loops, high-density nodes) before scaling to full long-haul conversions.

● Forge industry-regulator engagement. Participate in rulemaking, industry coalitions, or pilot programs so that insights influence realistic standards rather than reactive mandates.

● Protect optionality in fleets. When buying powertrains or vehicles, favor architectures that can be retrofitted or upgraded, not locked into a single technology bet.

● Play the long game. Delaying emissions investments risks stranded assets when standards inevitably rebound.

● Work with your partners. Whether technology, service or consultants, work closely with your partners on what trends, best practices and investments that others are making.

Innovation by design, not by force

Logistics innovation over the next decade will not be a linear march toward a cleaner, safer future; it will be steered by the winds of policy, regulation, and leaders investing in change. Safety regulations are holding strong, requiring immediate attention and investment, while environmental rollbacks may provide a moment of reprieve before kicking back into gear.

Throughout uncertainty, logistics leaders must treat policy as an inspiration for design, not merely a compliance overlay. Resilient platforms, modular capabilities, and intelligent systems will thrive under shifting rules.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/annika-adobestock-589591429.53bB1XEbQs.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-08 19:03:11.541760

New dietary guidelines

It's being touted as ""the most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in decades."" Under the direction of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Trump administration has released new dietary guidelines for Americans, looking to address the escalating health costs stemming from chronic illness and the highest level of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in the developed world. The 10-page report is in sharp contrast to the previous 164-page report in not just size, but also revises some past notable recommendations.

Snapshot: The new inverted pyramid is based on protein, dairy, and vegetables and fruits, with whole grains taking a smaller portion of the diagram. Healthy fats are also encouraged, including omega-3-rich seafood, nuts, and avocados, as well as full-fat dairy over low-fat options, and foods to promote ""gut health"" like kimchi and kefir. It additionally takes aim at processed foods and refined carbohydrates, while removing specific daily limits on alcohol, and instead encouraged Americans to ""consume less alcohol for better overall health.""

Meanwhile, war was declared on the sweet stuff. ""No amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is recommended or considered part of a healthy or nutritious diet,"" according to the HHS, which called on parents to completely avoid added sugar for children four years old and younger. While the Sugar Association applauded HHS’s recommendation to limit sugar intake, they objected to how the report overstates and extrapolates the actual science, studying just the relationship between sugar-sweetened beverages and various health outcomes.

Elsewhere: The response from the food industry was predictable, as the American Beverage Association – whose members include Coca-Cola Company (KO), PepsiCo (PEP), and Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) – argued that ""Americans deserve pragmatic advice they can use in daily life"" and that the new guidance ""dismisses safe, effective no sugar options, is impractical, and inherently contradictory."" The news weighed slightly on companies whose revenue relies heavily on processed foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Shares of Hormel (HRL), Conagra Brands (CAG), Kraft Heinz (KHC), and Mondelez (MDLZ) were all trading defensively following the press conference. (52 comments)

Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.
“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote.

The AI giant is acquiring the team behind Convogo, a business software platform that helps executive coaches, consultants, talent leaders, and HR teams automate and improve leadership assessments and feedback reporting.

An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is not acquiring Convogo’s IP or technology, but rather hiring the team to work on its “AI cloud efforts.” The three co-founders — Matt Cooper, Evan Cater, and Mike Gillett — will join OpenAI as part of what a source familiar with the matter called an all-stock deal.

Convogo’s product will be wound down.

The startup began as a “weekend hackathon” sparked by a question by Cooper’s mother, who is an executive coach: Could an AI tool automate the drudgery of report writing so she could spend more time on the human coaching work she loves? Over the past two years, Convogo has helped “thousands” of coaches and partnered with the “world’s top leadership development firms,” per an email bearing news of the acquisition sent by Convogo.

In the email, the team wrote that the real problem they uncovered in their work is how to bridge the gap between what is possible with each new model release and how to translate that into real-world outcomes.

“We’re convinced now more than ever that the key to bridging that gap lies in thoughtful, purpose-built experiences, like what we’ve built for coaches at Convogo,” the founders wrote. “That’s why we’re thrilled to join OpenAI to continue our work of making AI accessible and useful to professionals in every industry.”

The Convogo acqui-hire marks OpenAI’s ninth acquisition in the span of a year, per PitchBook data. In nearly all of those acquisitions, the product was either folded into OpenAI’s ecosystem — as in the case of Sky, the AI interface for Mac, or Statsig, a product testing firm — or completely shut down as the team joined OpenAI, as in the cases of Roi, Context.ai, and Crossing Minds.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2206295463.jpg?resize=1200,800",N,,2026-01-08 15:14:59.638871

Here are some innovative uses of CRISPR in agriculture:

Enhanced Fungi for Meat Alternatives

One of the most notable innovative uses of CRISPR in agriculture is the development of genetically engineered fungi that can serve as a sustainable and nutritious meat alternative.

Improved Digestibility and Production Efficiency: Researchers have used CRISPR to modify fungi, making them easier to digest and less resource-intensive to produce. ""Using CRISPR, researchers made a protein packed fungi that’s easier to stomach. The genetically engineered fungus that tastes like meat and could have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional livestock or even “lab-grown” cell-cultured meat.""

Specific Modifications: Scientists from Jiangnan University in China tweaked the DNA of Fusarium venenatum, a fungus already used as a meat alternative, to enhance its nutritional profile and reduce production costs. ""Using CRISPR gene editing technology, researchers from Jiangnan University in China took a fungus that is already used as a meat alternative (Fusarium venenatum) and tweaked its DNA to make it easier to digest and less resource-intensive to produce.""

Environmental and Economic Benefits: This gene-edited fungi requires significantly less sugar to produce the same amount of protein and produces protein much faster than its non-altered counterpart. It also has a smaller environmental footprint compared to traditional livestock. ""This new, edited DNA strain required 44 percent less sugar to produce the same amount of protein as a non-genetically altered strain. It was also able to produce protein 88 percent faster than the original version.""

General Applications in Agriculture

CRISPR is also being explored for broader applications in agriculture to improve crop resilience and yield.

Crop Improvement: CRISPR can be used to develop crops that are more resistant to diseases, pests, and harsh environmental conditions, leading to increased yields and reduced need for pesticides. ""Scientists find applications of CRISPR in Agriculture""

Accessibility for Research: The relative ease and affordability of CRISPR kits make it accessible for researchers and even biohackers to experiment with genetic modifications, potentially leading to more innovative agricultural solutions. ""Assuming you have the target transgene or knockout mapped and your guide snippet, they have kits that cost about 500 bucks and only require basic lab equipment to use. They are easy enough to use that if you can follow a cookbook recipe you could crispr something.""

Future Potential

The potential for CRISPR in agriculture is vast, with ongoing research exploring new ways to enhance food production and sustainability.

Addressing Food Demands: Gene-edited foods like the fungi meat alternative can help meet the growing global food demands without the high environmental costs associated with traditional farming. ""Gene-edited foods like this can meet growing food demands without the environmental costs of conventional farming.""

Nutritional Enhancements: CRISPR can be used to improve the nutritional content of crops, such as increasing vitamin levels or protein content. ""the amino acid score and availability is pretty good. i'd eat this if its economically viable to animal proteins.""

The inclusion of brands like Peloton in the offering’s initial rollout is a positive sign for fitness brands

More than 230 million people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week, a pattern OpenAI says has been playing out for some time.

Now, it is formalizing that behavior with the launch of ChatGPT Health, which allows users to connect medical records and wellness apps to unify their data and better inform their health-related conversations.

Early integrations span fitness and nutrition platforms, such as Apple Health for movement, sleep and activity data, Function for lab test insights and nutrition guidance and MyFitnessPal for macros and recipes. Weight Watchers is also integrated, with a focus on GLP-1-related meal planning and food guidance.

Additional launch partners include Peloton for suggested workout classes or guided meditations, Instacart for turning meal plans into shoppable grocery lists and AllTrails for activity discovery.

Peloton said the integration gives members a level of personalization that was previously out of reach, allowing ChatGPT Health to make more tailored class recommendations based on medical context, such as injury recovery plans from a doctor or adjusting fitness focus based on cholesterol trends and recent Peloton output.

The partnership, Peloton added, builds on the launch of Peloton IQ, its newer on-device AI coaching system.

In a post announcing the new experience, OpenAI said ChatGPT Health was developed with input from more than 260 physicians and is designed to help users understand health trends and prepare for medical appointments, rather than replace professional care. Notably, medical record integrations and some app connections are U.S.-only for now.

The company also addressed what is likely to be a top concern: how health data is handled.

“Conversations and files across ChatGPT are encrypted by default at rest and in transit as part of our core security architecture,” OpenAI noted. “Due to the sensitive nature of health data, Health builds on this foundation with additional, layered protections — including purpose-built encryption and isolation—to keep health conversations protected and compartmentalized. Conversations in Health are not used to train our foundation models.”

Users can also add an additional layer of security by enabling multi-factor authentication.

OpenAI has opened a waitlist for ChatGPT Health and is starting with a small group of early users to refine the experience before expanding access more broadly in the coming weeks.

From a wider perspective, the launch comes as AI is quickly becoming unavoidable across the fitness industry.

As project definition advanced and market conditions improved, the mandate was increased to up to US$1 billion in November 2025 (see November 19, 2025 press release).","January 8, 2026, Montreal, Quebec – Troilus Mining Corp. (TSX: TLG; OTCQX: CHXMF; FRA: CM5) (“Troilus” or the “Company”), is pleased to provide a review of its key accomplishments in 2025 and an outlook for 2026, as the Company advances its flagship Troilus copper-gold project (the “Project”) through critical development milestones and positions it for the next phase of execution, in this open letter to shareholders from Chief Executive Officer, Justin Reid.

To our valued shareholders and stakeholders,

As we reflect on 2025, it is clear that the Troilus Team achieved major technical, regulatory, organizational, and financing milestones required to advance the Project into its next phase of development, while substantially increasing shareholder value, with the Company’s share price increasing by approximately 432% over the year. This progress has established a strong foundation as we enter 2026—a transition year focused on advancing detailed engineering, permitting and financing in preparation for construction.

Throughout the year, we advanced across all critical development streams in parallel. We completed basic engineering and transitioned into detailed engineering, submitted our Environmental and Social Impact Assessment at both the federal and provincial levels, and further improved geological confidence of mineral resources through targeted drilling. At the same time, we strengthened the organization with key additions to our leadership and operational teams and continued to modernize internal systems to support the transition from project development to execution.

Outstanding market performance over the year reflected the impact of this operational delivery and continued investor confidence in the quality and scale of the Troilus Project. Importantly, this performance was underpinned by tangible progress on the ground and increasing project readiness, rather than macro conditions alone.

We were pleased to see Troilus continue to be recognized as a project of strategic importance within the broader critical minerals ecosystem. Our inclusion as a corporate delegate on the Canadian government’s critical-minerals trade missions to Germany and to Japan and South Korea reflect growing global interest in the Project and its alignment with secure, long-term supply-chain priorities.

Separately, in recognition of the breadth of progress and execution achieved across all aspects of the Project throughout the year, we were honoured to receive the Québec Mineral Exploration Association’s Entrepreneur of the Year award in late October (see October 30,2025 press release).

With the key gating items of the development pathway now well advanced, Troilus enters 2026 focused on disciplined execution. The coming year is expected to mark a transition from planning to early construction readiness, as we continue to advance and de-risk the Project.

2025 Key Accomplishments:

Technical and Project De-Risking

Technical progress remained the primary focus throughout 2025. During the year, Troilus maintained schedule discipline, completing basic engineering and transitioning into detailed engineering under the direction of BBA Inc (see January 28, June 10, and October 15, 2025 press releases). Major engineering deliverables – including process flowsheet definition, capital cost estimation, procurement planning, and project execution planning – were substantially advanced, with all key requests for quotations issued and technical and commercial evaluations of major equipment and construction packages well progressed. This work materially strengthens project definition and supports construction readiness by underpinning permitting, financing, and advanced exploration.

In parallel, Troilus submitted its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) to both federal and provincial authorities, marking one of the most significant gating items for the Project (see June 25, 2025 press release). The submission met internal targets, and the review process is well advanced, with federal approval currently targeted for the second half of 2026 and provincial approval to follow. Ongoing engagement with regulators, stakeholders and Indigenous rightsholders continue as part of this process.

The Company also completed approximately 13,300 metres of drilling during the year, most of which focused on delineating and extending high-grade trends to further improve geological confidence, upgrading resources to indicated and measured categories (see February 4, May 22, June 17, 2025 press releases).

Building a Construction-Ready Organization

With key technical milestones achieved, Troilus continued to build the organizational capacity required for the next phase of development.

Throughout 2025, the Company made several targeted senior appointments across Project leadership, construction, processing, health and safety, and operational readiness, aligning the organization with the evolving needs of the Project as it advances toward execution. Several new members of the operational team have committed to a Chibougamau-based presence, further supporting local integration and readiness.

Health and safety remained a core priority. Troilus achieved zero lost-time incidents during calendar 2025 and made meaningful progress in implementing a modern health and safety framework aligned with best practices within the Québec mining sector. Enhanced data collection, proactive risk analysis, and preventative systems have been put in place, supported by the recent addition of a dedicated Health and Safety Superintendent. These efforts will continue in 2026 to ensure that health and safety are a top priority at the Troilus site as we prepare for increased activity and an influx of new workers.

Internally, Troilus also advanced work to modernize and strengthen its operating systems and corporate infrastructure. Preparatory work was undertaken to support the implementation of upgraded enterprise and operational systems in 2026, ensuring scalability, transparency, and operational discipline as the Company transitions toward construction and operations.

Financing and Commercial Progress

Advancing a generational copper-gold operation producing more than 300,000 gold-equivalent ounces per year requires a comprehensive and resilient financing strategy. Following the release of the Troilus Project Feasibility Study in May 2024 (see May 14, 2024 press release), the Company made it a priority to establish a funding framework capable of supporting construction while maintaining flexibility through development.

By late 2024, Troilus had secured indicative expressions of interest (“LOIs”) totaling approximately US$1.3 billion from a group of leading global export credit agencies (“ECAs”), providing the foundation for a structured project financing process (see November 13, November 19 and November 21, 2024 press releases).

In March 2025, Troilus mandated a syndicate of global financial institutions, led by Société Générale, KfW IPEX-Bank, and Export Development Canada, to arrange a senior project debt facility of up to US$700 million (see March 13, 2025 press release). As project definition advanced and market conditions improved, the mandate was increased to up to US$1 billion in November 2025 (see November 19, 2025 press release). Comprehensive technical, financial, and environmental and social due diligence has been underway since early 2025 and will continue in 2026 to underpin the finalization of the debt package.

Commercial arrangements progressed in parallel and are integrated into the debt financing framework. During 2025, Troilus negotiated preliminary indicative long-term offtake terms with Aurubis AG and Boliden Commercial AB, two of Europe’s leading copper smelters, covering a significant portion of the Project’s anticipated copper-gold concentrate production and reflecting strong demand for high-quality, responsibly sourced copper (see June 18, July 10, and August 26, 2025 press releases). In parallel, discussions with potential Canadian smelters are ongoing, with the expectation that a portion of future concentrate production will be processed domestically to support local supply chains. These arrangements are expected to be finalized in 2026.

In November 2025, the Company strengthened its balance sheet through a CDN$172.5 million bought-deal public offering, representing the second-largest common share offering by a Québec-headquartered company in over a decade and the second-largest TSX issuer financing completed in 2025 (see November 14, 2025 press release). The financing further expanded Troilus’ institutional shareholder base, including the participation of new major global funds.

Looking ahead, the senior debt facility is expected to form the cornerstone of a fully funded construction package, complemented by additional financing instruments under evaluation, with the objective of delivering a balanced and flexible financing solution in 2026.

And it’s clear that an integrated global market is necessary for sufficient copper to get to where it is most needed.
Saudi Arabia is also rapidly building out its copper refining capacity.
So for copper, the only path forward is through trade.","Copper is a conflict mineral of the future, an indispensable building block for critical technologies that has long been taken for granted but that will play an increasingly central role in US trade relations with China and Latin America—where most of the world’s copper production and processing capacity are located. The S&P study stresses that copper can’t be obtained at the necessary volumes or timelines through recycling or new mining alone. A 2022 S&P report pegged copper demand even higher, reaching above 50 million tons annually by 2040, but that was based on a “net zero” scenario in which renewable energy and EV use expand faster than they currently are. Even under the current pace of adoption, copper demand will still likely grow at least 1 million tons per year up to 2040, the new report found. Filling that need is a diplomatic challenge at least as much as an engineering one, with critical steps of the supply chain spread around the globe.

US President Donald Trump’s recent escalation in saber-rattling toward mineral-rich Greenland — whose deposits of copper are likely significant but remain underexplored — shows the administration’s willingness to exercise force to expand US access to raw materials. But taking minerals by force may close off access to other pieces of the supply puzzle by further ratcheting up protectionism on the part of other powers.

And it’s clear that an integrated global market is necessary for sufficient copper to get to where it is most needed. The US urgently needs to catch up to China on copper processing capability, which invading Greenland won’t help address: The US has only two functioning smelters, while China has dozens (which help to keep their costs low through the use of cheap renewable electricity, as well as plentiful supplies of heavily polluting coal). Saudi Arabia is also rapidly building out its copper refining capacity.

So for copper, the only path forward is through trade. “If we think it will be solved for the US by investment in the US, we’re never going to get there,” said Carlos Pascual, S&P Global’s senior vice president for geopolitics and international affairs.","https://img.semafor.com/4b0b93be598680a19e42ba37a19e4e0e87b97019-6000x4000.jpg?rect=0,425,6000,3150&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2026-01-08 13:14:43.479391

Tezos, a self-amending blockchain platform, is gaining attention for its potential price trajectory through 2030, driven by its technological advancements and market positioning. Since its 2018 launch, Tezos has been recognized for its proof-of-stake consensus, on-chain governance, and formal verification capabilities, which allow protocol upgrades without hard forks. In 2024, Tezos processed over 50 million transactions, maintaining energy efficiency significantly higher than proof-of-work networks. The platform's total value locked in decentralized applications reached $150 million by late 2024, marking a 300% year-over-year growth. Institutional adoption is also on the rise, with entities like Société Générale utilizing Tezos for digital asset securities. Analysts predict that upcoming platform upgrades, such as enhanced Ethereum Virtual Machine compatibility, could further boost developer accessibility and price appreciation. Additionally, regulatory clarity and the growing tokenization of real-world assets are expected to support Tezos's market expansion. Long-term projections for Tezos through 2030 consider its established presence in digital art, gaming, and regulated finance. As enterprise blockchain adoption becomes mainstream, Tezos's unique governance model and energy efficiency may offer competitive advantages. However, the platform faces challenges from intense competition and macroeconomic factors, which could impact its valuation. Investors are advised to monitor network activity, developer growth, and partnerships to assess Tezos's potential for significant market expansion.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific and product officer at Lilly.
The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and is subject to regulatory approvals and Ventyx stockholder consent.
Lilly also inked a deal in July 2021 worth potentially more than $1 billion when the company acquired Protomer Technologies.","With less than a week to go before the annual JP Morgan (JPM) healthcare conference and Biotech Showcase, Eli Lilly has signed a $1.2 billion all-cash deal to acquire Ventyx.

Ventyx’s pipeline features small molecule therapeutics, including NLRP3 inhibitors, designed to target inflammation across a spectrum of diseases with high unmet medical needs. These include cardiometabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and autoimmune conditions. The company’s clinical-stage programs aim to deliver improved efficacy and safety compared to existing treatments.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” said Daniel Skovronsky, chief scientific and product officer at Lilly. “Ventyx’s pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options and strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients across cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity.”

The acquisition terms include a purchase price of $14.00 per share, representing a 62% premium to Ventyx’s 30-day volume-weighted average trading price as of January 5, 2026. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 and is subject to regulatory approvals and Ventyx stockholder consent. Entities affiliated with New Science Ventures and Ventyx’s directors and officers (representing approximately 10% of the company’s outstanding shares) have already signed voting and support agreements.

Raju Mohan, CEO of Ventyx, echoed Skovronsky’s sentiment through highlighting the potential of their NLRP3 inhibitors to address residual and chronic inflammation, which is now recognized as a major risk factor in neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. “Lilly’s resources and commitment to innovative oral drugs make them an ideal partner to advance our therapies and address vast unmet needs,” he said.

This acquisition builds on Lilly’s presence in inflammatory-mediated diseases. In January 2020, the firm shelled out $1.1 billion to purchase Dermira. The acquisition added lebrikizumab lebrikizumab, an IL-13 inhibitor for atopic dermatitis, to Lilly's portfolio. It also included Qbrexza, a treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating).

Lilly also inked a deal in July 2021 worth potentially more than $1 billion when the company acquired Protomer Technologies.

“American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods — protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains — and dramatically reduce highly processed foods.
Whole grains The previous Dietary Guidelines recommended three servings of whole grains and three servings of refined grains daily.
The website placed much of the blame on processed foods.
“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to Americans: Dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet,” said Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association.","WASHINGTON — The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2025-2030 released Jan. 7 upended several recommendations from a Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) and flipped the old food pyramid upside down.

Unlike the previous pyramid, which was replaced by MyPlate over a decade ago, the new pyramid places the food that should be consumed the most at its flat top: nutrient-dense protein from animal and plant sources; healthy fats from whole foods such as eggs, seafood, meats, full-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, olives and avocados; and vegetables and fruit.

The new pyramid has whole grains at the pointy bottom, promoting two to four servings a day, and it leaves out refined grains entirely. In the old pyramid, bread, cereal, rice and pasta were at the bottom base, with recommendations of 6 to 11 servings per day.

“These Guidelines return us to the basics,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “American households must prioritize whole, nutrient-dense foods — protein, dairy, vegetables, fruits, healthy fats and whole grains — and dramatically reduce highly processed foods. This is how we make America healthy again.”

The HHS and the US Department of Agriculture update the Dietary Guidelines every five years.

Whole grains

The previous Dietary Guidelines recommended three servings of whole grains and three servings of refined grains daily. The new Dietary Guidelines recommend that consumers should prioritize fiber-rich whole grains and reduce consumption of highly processed carbohydrates.

“The updated Guidelines place an emphasis on whole grains, which aligns with long-standing public health goals,” said Erin Ball, executive director of the Grain Foods Foundation. “However, the Guidelines de-emphasize grains overall, and the guidance does not recommend refined and enriched grain foods — thus ignoring their role in nutrient delivery, affordability and how baked goods function in everyday eating patterns.”

Fifty percent of Americans have prediabetes or diabetes, 75% of adults report having at least one chronic disease, and 90% of US health care spending goes to treating chronic disease, according to realfood.gov. The website placed much of the blame on processed foods.

“For the first time, we’re calling out the dangers of highly processed foods and rebuilding a broken system from the ground up with gold-standard science and common sense,” the website said.

Going against the DGAC

Normally, the Dietary Guidelines take the findings of the DGAC into account. This time the administration of President Donald Trump did a supplemental scientific analysis of the 2025 DGAC report, which was finished during the Biden administration. The analysis found that the DGAC advocated plant-based dietary patterns, deprioritized animal-sourced proteins and favored high-linoleic acid vegetable oils.

The new Dietary Guidelines do not implement several DGAC recommendations, including emphasizing the intake of beans, peas and lentils while reducing intakes of red and processed meats, and emphasizing consumption of low-fat or non-fat dairy and unsaturated fats.

“The new Dietary Guidelines send a clear and powerful message to Americans: Dairy foods belong at the center of a healthy diet,” said Michael Dykes, DVM, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “IDFA applauds HHS and USDA for grounding the 2025–2030 DGA in today’s nutrition science, including the evidence showing that dairy products at all fat levels support healthy eating patterns.”

The new Dietary Guidelines will “partially” implement the DGAC report’s recommendation to limit foods and beverages higher in saturated fat and to limit total saturated fat intake to less than 10% of calories per day, starting at age 2, by replacing it with unsaturated fat, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acid.

The new Dietary Guidelines also implement several other DGAC recommendations, including limiting foods high in added sugars and emphasizing intakes of iron, folate/folic acid, iodine and chlorine among pregnant and postpartum individuals. The new pyramid encourages avoiding added sugars entirely, especially for children, while allowing naturally occurring sugars found in whole fruits and plain dairy.

“The administration pledged the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans would deliver fresh, simple, comprehensive, science-based guidance,” said Courtney Gaine, PhD, president and CEO of The Sugar Association. “Instead, the 500 pages of new materials released today reflect outdated rhetoric about added sugars that are anything but simple and are inconsistent, unrealistic and lacking scientific support. These Guidelines and accompanying rhetoric will not make Americans any healthier. In fact, added sugars intake has already plummeted 30% over the past two decades, while obesity has spiked by 40%.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2026/01/08/1767889620885-ebb4cf97-5482-4f25-b1f7-c58e13b939f4_1.jpg?height=635&t=1767889960&width=1200,N,,2026-01-08 15:02:25.901201

ID18,Eli Lilly,2026-01-08 16:57:37+00:00,MedCity News,Eli Lilly Boosts Its Immunology Drug Pipeline With $1.2B Ventyx Bio Acquisition,"Frank Vinluan, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://medcitynews.com/2026/01/eli-lilly-ventyx-biosciences-acquisition-nlrp3-inhibitor-inflammation-vtyx-lly/,"That data readout triggered discussions with Sanofi, whose prior investment in Ventyx gave it the right of first negotiation on the program.
In October, Ventyx reported preliminary data from a Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk and obesity.
This study included a cohort that evaluated the study drug alongside Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 weight loss drug, Wegovy.
Beyond NLRP3, Ventyx has compounds in mid-stage clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease: the S1P1R modulator tamuzimod and the TYK2 inhibitor VTX958.
Novo’s pipeline lists an NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 1 development for the fatty liver disease MASH and cardiovascular disease.","Eli Lilly is building its prospects in immunology through the $1.2 billion acquisition of Ventyx Biosciences, a clinical-stage company with drugs addressing a promising target offering the potential to treat a range of inflammatory disorders.

The deal announced after Wednesday’s market close follows Ventyx’s fall release of mid-stage data for lead program VTX3232, a drug in development for treating inflammation that contributes to cardiovascular disease. That data readout triggered discussions with Sanofi, whose prior investment in Ventyx gave it the right of first negotiation on the program. But Lilly won out with a deal to buy the entire company.

Ventyx develops oral small molecule drugs for inflammatory disorders. In recent years, the San Diego-based biotech honed its R&D focus to drugs that inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex that regulates inflammatory signaling. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs that target NLRP3.

In October, Ventyx reported preliminary data from a Phase 2 study that enrolled patients with cardiovascular risk and obesity. The readout showed treatment with VTX3232 reduced levels of a liver protein associated with inflammation along with reductions in a range of biological measures indicative of cardiovascular risk. The drug was safe and well tolerated. But VTX3232 does not appear to have a future as an obesity drug. This study included a cohort that evaluated the study drug alongside Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 weight loss drug, Wegovy. Results showed VTX3232 did not lead to weight loss as a monotherapy or in addition to Wegovy.

The cardiovascular results followed the summer release of encouraging data from a separate Phase 2 test of VTX3232 in Parkinson’s disease. In this indication, Ventyx is leveraging the brain-penetrating properties of the molecule as a way to treat the neurodegenerative disorder.

The Ventyx pipeline also includes VTX2735, a peripherally restricted NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 2 testing for recurrent pericarditis. Beyond NLRP3, Ventyx has compounds in mid-stage clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease: the S1P1R modulator tamuzimod and the TYK2 inhibitor VTX958. Lilly sees broad potential applications for Ventyx’s drugs.

“There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases,” Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific and product officer and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said in a prepared statement. “Ventyx’s clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity.”

Lilly’s main metabolic medicines rival, Novo Nordisk, has an NLRP3 inhibitor licensed from startup Ventus Therapeutics. Novo’s pipeline lists an NLRP3 inhibitor in Phase 1 development for the fatty liver disease MASH and cardiovascular disease. Roche also has a clinical-stage NLRP3 inhibitors in its pipeline. Other companies with NLRP3 inhibitors include BioAge Labs and startup Nodthera.

The financial terms of the acquisition agreement call for Lilly to pay $14 in cash for each share of Ventyx, an approximately 62% premium to the stock’s average trading price in the 30 days leading up to Jan. 5. Shares of Ventyx spiked earlier this week after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Lilly was close to striking a deal for the biotech.

The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction, which still requires approvals from Ventyx stockholders and regulators. Lilly expects to close the acquisition in the first half of this year.

(ACI) has been on a downward spiral lately with significant selling pressure. After declining 5.7% over the past four weeks, the stock looks well positioned for a trend reversal as it is now in oversold territory and there is strong agreement among Wall Street analysts that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.

We use Relative Strength Index (RSI), one of the most commonly used technical indicators, for spotting whether a stock is oversold. This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements.

RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Usually, a stock is considered oversold when its RSI reading falls below 30.

Technically, every stock oscillates between being overbought and oversold irrespective of the quality of their fundamentals. And the beauty of RSI is that it helps you quickly and easily check if a stock's price is reaching a point of reversal.

So, by this measure, if a stock has gotten too far below its fair value just because of unwarranted selling pressure, investors may start looking for entry opportunities in the stock for benefiting from the inevitable rebound.

However, like every investing tool, RSI has its limitations, and should not be used alone for making an investment decision.

Here's Why ACI Could Experience a Turnaround

The heavy selling of ACI shares appears to be in the process of exhausting itself, as indicated by its RSI reading of 24.44. So, the trend for the stock could reverse soon for reaching the old equilibrium of supply and demand.

The RSI value is not the only factor that indicates a potential turnaround for the stock in the near term. On the fundamental side, there has been strong agreement among the sell-side analysts covering the stock in raising earnings estimates for the current year. Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for ACI has increased 0.5%. And an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.

Moreover, ACI currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .

Venture capital funding rebounded as concerns about tariffs lessened, key drug launches beat expectations and a flurry of acquisitions demonstrated faith in smaller biotechs.
The funding round announced by Parabilis comes amid similar recent announcements from Soley Therapeutics, Diagonal Therapeutics, EpiBiologics and Beacon Therapeutics, among others.
Parabilis’ financing is the largest disclosed in early January.
The result was what is now the Helicon platform, which Parabilis says it can use to reach multiple critical targets previously considered undruggable.","Dive Brief:

Parabilis Medicines, formerly known as FogPharma, raised $305 million in a Series F financing to support its mission of pursuing disease targets long dismissed as out of reach by modern science.

RA Capital Management, Fidelity Management and Janus Henderson Investors led the latest round of financing, which included both old and new investors, Parabilis said Thursday. The Series F gave the company a higher valuation than the previous round, which pulled in $145 million in early 2024.

The company plans to use the funds to advance its lead drug candidate, zolucatetide, which is designed to target a beta-catenin pathway connected to millions of cancer cases. The experimental therapy has shown “compelling preliminary data” in an ongoing Phase 1/2 trial, Parabilis said.

Dive Insight:

Parabilis is riding a wave of resurgent enthusiasm for venture capital funding in the industry. A downturn after the pandemic dramatically slowed the pace of new public offerings and left private companies struggling for cash. Trump administration policies that gutted scientific funding, introduced turmoil into regulatory agencies and threatened tariffs on the industry made the situation worse.

But the second half of 2025 saw a turnaround for biopharma. Venture capital funding rebounded as concerns about tariffs lessened, key drug launches beat expectations and a flurry of acquisitions demonstrated faith in smaller biotechs. IPOs may be poised to bounce back as well, with Aktis Oncology set to be the first to test the waters this year.

The funding round announced by Parabilis comes amid similar recent announcements from Soley Therapeutics, Diagonal Therapeutics, EpiBiologics and Beacon Therapeutics, among others. Parabilis’ financing is the largest disclosed in early January.

Parabilis has long had a high profile for a cancer medicine startup. The company’s Helicon technology is based on work done by co-founder Greg Verdine and his team in a laboratory at Harvard University starting in the late 1990s. Verdine has since become a serial biotech entrepreneur.

At Harvard, Verdine’s team set out to overcome the problem that traditional drugs have in reaching and binding to disease-causing proteins inside a cell. They developed short peptides in a specific helix shape that could enter cells and block disease targets. The result was what is now the Helicon platform, which Parabilis says it can use to reach multiple critical targets previously considered undruggable.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tHEZGFPa2Rv4qRS17rNgUQD9oDLeT_A1u3fMgwa-xqk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9NYXRoYWlNYW1tZW4tOC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-08 18:04:55.416639

Walmart appointed the former CEO of Grammarly (now Superhuman) Shishir Mehrotra to its board of directors, according to a Thursday press release.

Mehrotra will serve on the board’s technology and e-commerce committee, as well as its compensation and management development committee.

He brings over 25 years of technology experience to the appointment, including co-founding an AI platform and serving as YouTube’s chief product officer and chief technology officer.

Dive Insight:

Mehrotra’s tech background ties into Walmart’s larger efforts to adopt AI across the business.

“I have long admired Walmart’s ability to innovate while staying true to its core values, and joining the Board as the company builds for an agentic AI future is a rare opportunity,” Mehrotra said in a statement. “This era is the most significant technological shift I’ve seen in my career, and I look forward to working with the team to shape the future for the millions of people Walmart serves.”

The mass retailer announced a slew of AI-related tools and initiatives in 2025.

Walmart in July debuted a new AI framework for the entire business that centers around four “super agents” and unifies its approach to the technology, aiming to avoid fragmented innovation across the company. Since then, Walmart has expressed confidence in its customer-facing AI agent Sparky becoming more important for shoppers and also launched new tools for marketplace sellers.

The company has also inked a deal with AI powerhouse OpenAI to create custom certification trainings for employees and started selling through ChatGPT’s Instant Checkout shopping feature.

Mehrotra’s appointment comes a few weeks before Walmart veteran John Furner is set to take over the CEO position from Doug McMillon. When Furner’s appointment was announced in November, the emergence of artificial intelligence in retail was specifically mentioned by McMillon.

“He’s uniquely capable of leading the company through this next AI-driven transformation,” McMillon said in a statement at the time. “He’s a merchant, an operator, an innovator, and a builder.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/R9RgNAwK9r8pSjQk9DFiJ9sF-QCaEOt7Ul3ooHfVo9I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9XYWxtYXJ0X0dlcm1hbnRvd25fTWFyeWxhbmRfMDYwOTI1LTEuSlBH.webp,N,,2026-01-08 12:15:03.433476

Significance of Inogen’s Latest Offering

Per Inogen, Aurora Masks are expected to establish the company’s presence in the growing sleep-therapy market and expand its addressable market opportunity.

Management believes that the launch of Aurora CPAP masks is a pivotal step for Inogen toward expanding into a broad home care respiratory solutions company and its entry into the sleep apnea market.

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global sleep apnea devices market was estimated at $4.5 billion in 2023 and is anticipated to reach $6.9 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 6.2%. Factors like technological advancements and the growing elderly population's vulnerability to sleep apnea are likely to drive the market.

Given the market potential, the latest launch is expected to provide a significant boost to Inogen’s business.

Inogen’s Notable Launches

In November 2025, Inogen announced third-quarter 2025 results, wherein it confirmed that it initiated a limited market release of the Simeox airway clearance device in the United States.

The brands said a merger would allow them to better compete against growing rivals in the grocery industry, like Walmart and Costco, and would preserve customer choice.

However, the $24.6 billion deal was met with backlash as the federal government argued it would “almost certainly” benefit shareholders and not the people who visit the stores daily.

Under the deal, the two grocery chains would sell 579 locations in places where their stores overlap to C&S Wholesale Grocers, a supplier to independent supermarkets.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urged the judge in the case to temporarily prevent the merger in September 2024, as the commission previously worried the merger would lead to higher food prices for consumers and eliminate competition.

“It’s this local competition, in these local communities, that this merger will eliminate,” Susan Musser, the FTC’s chief trial counsel said, adding that Albertsons and Kroger compete with one another rather than places like Amazon or Costco where consumers partake in other kinds of shopping.

Kroger said it planned to invest $1 billion into lower prices “from day one” if the merger went through.

Musser said the judge should be skeptical about the companies’ promises as “promises can be broken.”

Johnson & Johnson has announced the submission of its Ottava Robotic Surgical System for De Novo classification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The Ottava system encompasses surgical instrumentation and will, in future, be connected to the Polyphonic digital ecosystem. It is intended to address unmet need for surgeons.The De Novo classification request – De Novo classification is designed for new, low-to-moderate-risk medical devices – centres on an indication for Ottava that covers upper abdomen surgery, including gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

The submission is based on data from the Ottava Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, filed data used to show Ottava’s safety and effectiveness. Initial cases were completed at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Centre by Dr Erik Wilson, chief of minimally invasive and elective general surgery at University of Texas Health (UT Health) Houston and lead study investigator.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the Ottava system, and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, chief scientific officer, MedTech at Johnson & Johnson.

Additionally, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval in late 2025 for the initiation of a US clinical trial of Ottava in inguinal hernia procedures. This is one of the US’ most commonly-performed surgeries.

Hani Abouhalka, company group chair, Surgery, MedTech at Johnson & Johnson, said: “We have taken learnings from Johnson & Johnson’s 140 years in surgery, our decades of leadership in minimally invasive surgery and the experiences robotic surgeons and hospitals have had over the past 20 years to design a soft tissue robotic system built for the future of surgery.”",https://pharmafile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/researchers_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:14.715095

Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.
Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed.
Instead of treating each smart bulb as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light.
Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users.","What you need to know

Unlike old scenes that assigned colors at random, Hue SpatialAware uses an algorithm to map your room so lights work together.

You scan your room with your phone, the Hue app builds a spatial model, and an algorithm orchestrates the scene automatically.

About half of Hue’s Scene Gallery supports SpatialAware at launch, including Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.

Until now, Hue scenes looked nice, but didn’t really understand your room. Colors were assigned to lights without knowing their actual spots. For example, a lamp behind your couch might shine as brightly as a ceiling light across the room, which could ruin the effect Hue wanted. Now, with a new feature called Hue SpatialAware, that guesswork is being replaced with a more thoughtful approach.

Hue SpatialAware is Philips Hue’s biggest step yet toward making lighting feel designed instead of just programmed. Instead of treating each smart bulb as a standalone object, the feature considers your room’s layout and the placement of each Hue light. It then spreads colors and brightness in a way that copies how light works in real life.

The Hue app uses augmented reality and asks you to scan your room with your phone or tablet. This scan builds a model that shows where each light is, including floor lamps, wall lights, and ceiling fixtures. After that, an algorithm takes over and arranges scenes so every light fits in naturally.

If you add new lights later, just scan the area again and the room model updates on its own.

Nature scenes get the biggest upgrade

The most noticeable upgrade is in Hue’s nature-inspired scenes. About half of the updated Scene Gallery will work with SpatialAware at launch, including options like Lake Mist, Mountain Breeze, Savanna Sunset, and Lake Placid.

In practice, if you choose a sunset-style scene, lights on one side of the room glow with warm yellows, while lights across the room turn deeper and darker. You can still use the classic scene mode if you want, but after seeing SpatialAware, the difference is clear.

Philips Hue says the feature is built for Bridge Pro users, framing it as a premium experience that leans heavily on smarter processing and room awareness.

Bridge Pro is also becoming more flexible. Now, users can combine several Bridges into one Bridge Pro setup, with the only limit being the hardware’s capacity.

Hue’s AI assistant is also getting better. Now, you can ask it to create automations using natural language, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. It’s also adding more language support and learning how to guide users to the right troubleshooting help when problems come up.

Hue SpatialAware will launch in spring 2026 for Bridge Pro users. Most of the other upgrades will arrive between now and the first quarter of 2026.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4y4JJNKP4ijz9rWNSc3jrC-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:48.551717

This is the conclusion of an analysis by wine market analyst Del Rey AWM based on market data from S&P Global.

In principle, the figures initially show that French wine exports were in decline during the first nine months of 2025. Between January and September, exports decreased by 2.5% in value and 1.8% in volume, while average prices fell slightly to €8.71 per liter (-0.7%). In absolute figures, this means an export of 9.4m hectoliters of wine worth €8.2bn for this period.

Sparkling wine prices reduced

A breakdown by category shows a mixed picture: sparkling wine exports, particularly Champagne, actually increased (+4.1%) to 148m liters. However, this growth was accompanied by a reversal of the previous year's price increases: average prices fell by 6.2% to €19.58 per liter, which led to a revenue decrease of 2.3% to €2.9bn.

For bottled still wines, prices remained relatively stable at €7.68 per liter, but exports declined in both volume (–3.2%) and value (–2.9% to just over €5bn). The bulk wine category, which is less significant for French wine exports, lost 2.1% in volume. However, prices that were 8.5% higher led to a revenue increase of 6.2% (totaling €140m).

If the value losses of French wine exports are differentiated regionally, it becomes clear that a good third of the deficit was caused by the lack of demand for Bordeaux wines: €50.3m of the total €152.9m decline in revenue for bottled still wines is attributable to Bordeaux. Languedoc also suffered a sharp drop in value of €25.9m (–22.7%). Overall, AOP wines were significantly more affected by the decline than IGP wines: €140m of the decline in turnover for non-sparkling bottled wines was caused by wines with a protected designation of origin.

A look at different markets shows that the decline in sales to Asia and North America was partially offset by increased exports to Europe, Oceania, and Africa. Of course, these could not compensate for the losses, especially in the USA and China. Deliveries to the United States from January to September 2025 fell by 10.6% in value and 3.5% in volume. However, looking at the third quarter of last year in isolation, French wine exports to the USA collapsed by 39% in value and 15.1% in volume, as average prices fell by 28.5%, which Del Rey believes was intended to offset the higher tariffs.

In China, the volume of French wine exports in the first nine months of 2025 even fell by 36%. The fact that the value only decreased by 23.8% is—unlike the situation in the USA—thanks to a price increase of 19%. The export losses are not due to the customs situation, but to the structural decline in wine consumption in China—whereby the French premiumization strategy prevented worse.

As different as the respective problems are, according to Del Rey, in view of some of the main competitors such as Australia and Italy, ""France suffered the largest decline among major suppliers."" Incidentally, exports to South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, and Luxembourg (–€48.5m alone) also fell. Better sales were achieved in Australia and New Zealand, but also in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom. As an outlook, Del Rey summarized: "" For all producers, market diversification, product innovation, and a stronger focus on premium wines as well as fresher and new wine-based beverages appear essential to navigating this increasingly complex environment.” SP",https://www.meininger.de/sites/meininger.de/files/fields/field_a_artikelbild/web_Frankreich-Exporte_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 18:05:14.699130

The San Diego-based company has made no secret of the fact that it was hoping to find additional pharma backing. Sanofi had already secured the right to first negotiation for Ventyx’s Parkinson’s and cardiovascular disease candidate VTX3232 as part of a $27 million investment the French pharma made in the biotech in 2024.

A first readout from a phase 2 study of VTX3232 last June tied the NLRP3 inhibitor to drops in biomarkers of NLRP3 inhibition as well as improvements in Parkinson’s motor and non-motor symptoms.

At the time, Ventyx CEO Raju Mohan, Ph.D., acknowledged that Sanofi’s right of first negotiation wouldn’t formally start until the second VTX3232 readout. But the CEO gave a strong hint that the company didn’t want to wait that long to secure a Big Pharma partner.

“Sanofi is not restricted to waiting until the second readout,"" Mohan said at a Jefferies event in June 2025. “They or anybody else can act any time. We can't solicit other folks as part of [the right of first negotiation], but somebody can say, ‘Hey, look, we love your data.’”

It sounds like Lilly did just that. The U.S. pharma announced Wednesday that it was paying $14 per share of Ventyx—more than double the $7.50 the stock closed out at Monday. The price tag values Ventyx at around $1.2 billion, Lilly explained in a Jan. 7 release.

VTX3232 doesn’t only have potential for Parkinson’s patients. In October, Ventyx read out data from a separate phase 2 study demonstrating that the drug cut levels of a biomarker for stroke and other serious risks by almost 80% within a week. That trial looked at VTX3232 as a monotherapy as well as an add-on to Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster weight loss drug semaglutide.

Beyond VTX3232, Ventyx has another NLRP3 inhibitor, dubbed VTX2735, in phase 2 studies for a type of heart inflammation called recurrent pericarditis. There are also two inflammatory bowel disease drugs in phase 2 development—an S1P1R modulator called tamuzimod and a TYK2 inhibitor called VTX958.

Mohan described Lilly as an “ideal strategic partner,” pointing to the pharma’s “unparalleled resources, a passion for innovative oral drugs and a commitment to advance novel therapies.”

“Our portfolio of class-leading NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognized as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases,” Mohan added.

Explaining the rationale behind the deal, Lilly Chief Scientific and Product Officer Daniel Skovronsky, M.D., Ph.D., alluded to “increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases.”

“Ventyx's clinical-stage pipeline addresses a critical need for better treatment options across diseases mediated by chronic inflammation and further strengthens our ability to deliver meaningful advances for patients living with challenging diseases across focus areas of cardiometabolic health, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity,” Skovronsky added.

William Blair analysts said yesterday’s deal “demonstrates clear interest from Big Pharma in the NLRP3 inhibitor class to address a broad range of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic, and cardiovascular diseases.”

In a Jan. 8 note, the analysts pointed out that other biopharmas are working in the NLRP3 space, name-checking the likes of Novartis, Neumora, Neurocrine Biosciences, BioAge, NodThera and Monte Rosa Therapeutics.

“NLRP3 in the [central nervous system] also represents an intriguing target for obesity and several preclinical studies across NLRP3 inhibitors suggest obesity efficacy in diet-induced-obesity models,” the analysts added. “However, not all NLRP3 inhibitors are CNS-penetrant.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/M%26A24.jpg?VersionId=C.FsKt7NUy1obRC7ODrMf.NqCjMX0jfl,N,,2026-01-08 11:04:37.687177

You see, instead of randomly assigning colours to bulbs, SpatialAware uses your phone’s camera to scan the room and map each light’s position. The system then applies colours in a way that mirrors real-world effects, such as a sunset glowing warmly on one side of the room while the opposite side fades into darker tones.

Smarter scenes, smoother moods

Lighting scenes have always been a highlight of the Hue app, offering quick ways to set a mood or transform a space. The problem was that colours often felt scattered, with no sense of flow between bulbs. That mismatch could break the illusion, leaving rooms looking more chaotic than calming.

SpatialAware fixes this by tailoring palettes to the actual layout of your lights, creating a sense of harmony across the room.

The difference is striking: instead of random splashes of colour, you get gradients that feel intentional and immersive.

Nature‑inspired scenes such as “Savannah Sunset” or “Lake Mist” show off the feature best, with ceiling lights glowing like open skies while floor lamps settle into deeper tones that ground the space. The result is a more cohesive atmosphere that feels closer to how light behaves in the real world, making everyday moments at home more inviting.

Bridge Pro gets its moment

SpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro, which launched last year. The latest update allows users to consolidate multiple bridges into one, supporting up to 150 lights and 50 accessories. That’s a big win for households already juggling several hubs.

AI assistant and Apple Home integration

Philips Hue’s AI assistant is also stepping up. It now creates automations based on natural requests, such as setting wake-up routines with exceptions. Language support continues to expand beyond English to include Dutch, German, and Spanish.

Some emerging retail trends, especially in technology, will become mainstream. Other trends will represent unique, strategic opportunities.

Here are five key trends to watch.

1. Price/Value Messaging will be 24/7

After a holiday in which price and savings took center stage in retail messaging, from Walgreens to Target, companies will need to figure out how to incorporate this in an ongoing way. Price and value strategies will be crucial because approaching year-end Consumer Confidence remained weak and many shoppers were pulling back on discretionary spending and focusing more on price-value optimization, according to the 2026 Food and Beverage retail sector outlook published in early December by Circana, a Chicago-based market research firm.

2. AI Will Drive Customer and Employee Engagement

AI is quickly moving from promise to reality at retail. It is supporting shopper journeys in ways that guarantee it will become more ubiquitous this year and beyond. Walmart introduced new AI-powered tools for holiday 2025 geared to helping customers find deals, locate products and shop efficiently in-store and online. Kroger, meanwhile, enhanced its Instacart relationship by making available to customers Instacart’s AI assistant called Cart Assistant, for those shopping on the Kroger iOS mobile app.

3. Loyalty Rewards to Push Envelope

Retailers are ratcheting up strategies to reward their most loyal shoppers, by offering exclusive opportunities and launching contests, for example. Albertsons recently became the first major grocer to offer Uber One perks to free and paid loyalty members through extended free trials. Aldi, meanwhile, unveiled a contest to celebrate its most loyal fans by asking for feedback on why they should be considered a “Super Fan?” An exclusive group of 25 winners are offered a year’s worth of free groceries, an invitation to a members-only event and Aldi merch. As shoppers feel more love from retailers, they will likely want more TLC in 2026.

4. Pharmacy Embracing the Long View

Pharmacies are taking proactive approaches to bolster their futures by enhancing relevancy to customers and society. CVS Health has been conducting extensive research on how to advance community pharmacy. The retailer released 2025 Rx Report: Community Pharmacy Reimagined, which explores how community pharmacies are adapting to meet needs amid a changing landscape. In another example, Walgreens has conducted what it calls the longest commitment to clinical research for a U.S. retail pharmacy, citing three years of leading a community-based research effort to improve patient access.

5. Store Development to Pursue Unique Approaches

In some years store development trends have been relatively uniform across retail. That has been anything but the case lately. Retailers are taking highly individual approaches, a dynamic likely to continue. Last year Target opened the latest of its larger-format units, a nearly 150,000-square-foot location in South Riding, Va. Contrast that with a recent strategy from Whole Foods Market, which has been opening locations of its smaller-format store concept, called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop, with footprints of only a few thousand square feet each.

Why are these trends important? In my annual outlook piece a year ago, I mentioned it’s easy for retailers to get so involved in day-to-day activities that they miss key changes in the most important business developments. That point is truer than ever. We can all benefit by staying focused on how these and other key trends unfold.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/assetbank_2583282911.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 12:03:06.948313

Kennedy Jr. and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. This historic reset—described by Kennedy as the most significant overhaul in decades—places real food, protein, and healthy fats squarely at the center of U.S. nutrition policy, while calling for a dramatic reduction in highly processed foods.

At a White House press conference, Kennedy declared, “These new guidelines will revolutionize our nation's food culture and make America healthier again.” Flanked by Rollins and other health officials, he introduced an updated food pyramid that visually prioritizes vegetables, proteins like red meat and eggs, cheese, and healthy fats such as olive oil and butter, with whole grains now forming the base of the pyramid. The visual overhaul is more than symbolic: it reflects a fundamental shift in federal thinking about what constitutes a healthy diet.

The new guidelines, updated every five years, are the backbone of federal food policy. They influence what’s served in school cafeterias, on military bases, and in food aid programs for mothers and infants. According to NPR, Kennedy and Rollins wrote that more than 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, attributing this crisis to a national diet “reliant on highly processed foods and coupled with a sedentary lifestyle.”

For the first time, the government is formally recommending that Americans cut down on ultra-processed foods. The guidelines explicitly warn against “packaged, prepared, ready-to-eat, or other foods that are salty or sweet,” as well as sugar-sweetened beverages like soda, fruit drinks, and energy drinks. Parents are advised to avoid all added sugars and artificial sweeteners for children under four years old, and the guidelines recommend no amount of added sugar for children under ten. “No amount of added sugars or non-nutritive sweeteners is part of a healthy diet,” the guidelines state, a stance that has drawn both praise and criticism from industry groups.

The new recommendations also call for Americans to “limit alcoholic beverages,” a departure from previous guidelines that specified daily limits for men and women. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, commented at the press conference, “There was never good data to support the previously recommended level of alcohol consumption.” He added, “In the best-case scenario, I don't think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize.”

One of the most controversial aspects of the new guidelines is the administration’s stance on saturated fats. Kennedy proclaimed, “We are ending the war on saturated fats,” arguing that protein and healthy fats “were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines.” The document encourages Americans to prioritize oils with essential fatty acids like olive oil, but also includes butter and beef tallow as acceptable options. Still, the guidelines maintain the long-held recommendation that saturated fat should not exceed 10% of daily calories—a point of contention for some nutrition experts.

“I'm very disappointed in the new pyramid that features red meat and saturated fat sources at the very top, as if that's something to prioritize. It does go against decades and decades of evidence and research,” said Christopher Gardner, a nutrition expert at Stanford University and a member of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, as reported by NPR. Both the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics point to evidence linking excess saturated fat to heart disease. The AHA, while welcoming the new emphasis on fruits and vegetables and the call to limit highly processed foods and added sugars, continues to encourage Americans to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood, and lean meats, and to limit high-fat animal products such as red meat, butter, lard, and tallow.

Despite the criticism, some experts see merit in the new approach. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University, told NPR, “Both low-fat and whole-fat dairy versions of milk, cheese, and yogurt have been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. What's quite interesting is that the fat content doesn't seem to make a big difference.” He also praised the guidelines’ focus on reducing highly processed foods, saying, “Highly processed foods are clearly harmful for a range of diseases, so to have the U.S. government recommend that a wide class of foods be eaten less because of their processing is a big deal and I think a very positive move for public health.”

The guidelines emphasize a diet rich in “high-quality, nutrient-dense” proteins at every meal. These include red meat, poultry, seafood, eggs, and, for those who prefer plant-based options, beans, peas, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy. According to the official HHS press release, the guidelines are intended to “improve Americans’ health by focusing on nutrition policy reform.”

Reactions from the food and beverage industry have been mixed. The Consumer Brands Association, representing major food companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, expressed a willingness to work with the administration while noting that consumers still “seek a diverse selection of foods.” The American Beverage Association, however, criticized the recommendations to limit both added sugar and other sweeteners. “Americans deserve pragmatic advice they can use in daily life. Guidance that discourages sugar but dismisses safe, effective no sugar options is impractical and inherently contradictory,” spokesperson William Dermody said in a statement to Axios.

Meanwhile, advocacy groups and influencers aligned with Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda have welcomed the changes. Vani Hari, known as the “Food Babe,” called the new guidelines “a dream come true,” telling Axios, “We put our full support in for Secretary Kennedy because he told the truth for the first time about the American food system ... and he is following through with his promise.”

It’s worth noting that while the guidelines have shifted to embrace more protein and healthy fats, they continue to recommend moderation and balance—echoing a longstanding body of nutritional science. A 2024 panel of nutrition experts advised HHS and USDA to encourage Americans to eat less saturated fat and meat, and to be cautious about ultra-processed foods. The new guidelines blend these expert recommendations with Kennedy’s own priorities, resulting in a policy that is both a break from and a continuation of past approaches.

As the updated guidelines begin to shape federal food programs, school lunches, and the choices Americans make at the dinner table, the nation is set for a new chapter in its ongoing debate over nutrition. Whether these changes will lead to measurable improvements in public health remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the conversation around what Americans eat has never been more front and center.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/aItl4xdZlb1wN4r52NxdJ_arVEI=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2Fda7f0ab9-d494-4c8f-b861-44803ef70a8d.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 14:02:18.193509

Aer Lingus currently serves 12 destinations in the U.S. A4A says the cap threatens to trigger the withdrawal of historic airport slots held by U.S. carriers at DUB, reducing or eliminating transatlantic services.
JetBlue, which launched its first flights to DUB in 2024, was previously denied requests to expand service because of capacity constraints tied to the passenger cap, according to the filing.
The group says this would violate provisions of the U.S.-EU agreement that guarantee airlines a “fair and equal opportunity to compete” and prohibit unilateral restrictions on traffic volumes.
The complaint asks the DOT to call a special meeting under the U.S.-EU air services agreement and to issue a show-cause order unless Ireland introduces emergency legislation to suspend or remove the cap by early February.","U.S. airlines have formally asked the U.S. Transportation Department (DOT) to intervene in a long-running dispute over passenger limits at Dublin Airport (DUB), arguing that the continued enforcement of a cap could restrict transatlantic service.

In a complaint filed Jan. 5, trade group Airlines for America (A4A) accused Ireland and the European Union of violating the U.S.-EU Air Transport Agreement and U.S. law by maintaining a local planning condition that caps passenger volumes at Dublin Airport at 32 million annually—a limit first imposed in 2007 tied to the construction of Terminal 2.

The filing, submitted under the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act, asks the DOT to take expedited action, including potentially curtailing Irish airlines’ access to the U.S. market if Ireland does not move to lift or suspend the cap. Aer Lingus currently serves 12 destinations in the U.S.

A4A says the cap threatens to trigger the withdrawal of historic airport slots held by U.S. carriers at DUB, reducing or eliminating transatlantic services. The group adds only an ongoing legal stay granted by Ireland’s High Court has so far prevented slot losses after airlines successfully challenged regulatory attempts to enforce seasonal limits tied to the cap.

Among the airlines cited in the complaint are Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways, which A4A says will be disproportionately affected if historic slots were withdrawn. JetBlue, which launched its first flights to DUB in 2024, was previously denied requests to expand service because of capacity constraints tied to the passenger cap, according to the filing.

The complaint outlines parallel legal proceedings in Ireland and at the Court of Justice of the European Union, where questions have been referred about whether the passenger cap complies with EU slot allocation rules. An advisory opinion from the court’s advocate general is due Feb. 12, with a final ruling expected later in 2026.

A4A argues that the EU court process does not address U.S. treaty rights and warns that an adverse ruling could allow Ireland to impose unilateral limits on air service. The group says this would violate provisions of the U.S.-EU agreement that guarantee airlines a “fair and equal opportunity to compete” and prohibit unilateral restrictions on traffic volumes.

Currently, DUB is exceeding the 32 million limit, handling around 36 million passengers in 2025, owing in part to High Court stays on enforcement.

The filing also details enforcement action launched by Fingal County Council, the local planning authority, against the airport operator for exceeding the cap. Airport operator daa has previously attempted to raise the limit to 36 million passengers.

Ireland’s government has publicly committed to removing the cap and has progressed draft legislation to increase or abolish the restriction, but no bill has yet become law. A4A says delays could force service reductions as early as the winter 2026-27 season if enforcement proceeds.

The complaint asks the DOT to call a special meeting under the U.S.-EU air services agreement and to issue a show-cause order unless Ireland introduces emergency legislation to suspend or remove the cap by early February.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2026-01-08 17:03:39.950344

The new show, called Bring My Pinterest to Life, follows three influencers (Drew Michael Scott, Caroline Vazzana and TayBeepBoop*) as they work with the platforms’ users on projects using a Pinterest board for inspiration. Each 22-minute episode will include real pins and boards, which viewers can save, shop, and explore without clicking away from the show. Some of the brands that will be available to shop on the show have already been announced, including Wayfair and Eos.

While Pinterest videos were already available to watch on CTV as Pinterest+, this will be the first TV show made by the platform. Other brands have successfully made the leap into entertainment — such as Red Bull — but not many. And Pinterest faces unique challenges as a platform that hosts no original content.

But the move is not completely out of the blue. In December, Pinterest announced its acquisition of cost-per-outcome CTV ad platform TvScientific, although the deal is still under regulatory review and is not expected to be confirmed until later this year.

At the time of the purchase, a spokesperson for Pinterest commented: ‘TvScientific’s outcome-based CTV platform will be integrated directly into Pinterest’s performance products, including its automation and AI-powered advertising suite, Pinterest Performance+.’

Pinterest’s announcement described the format, with its integrated ads, as an ‘emotionally resonant, shoppable’ ‘full-funnel path’ for viewers. It mirrors other features added to Pinterest to capture the full consumer journey, such as the shoppable recipes rolled out last month and Where to Buy links for consumer packaged goods pinned on the platform.

The trailer for Bring My Pinterest to Life was uploaded to YouTube on 5 Jan, and the show itself will be streaming on Roku from 23 March. The trailer is unlisted, and at time of writing has been viewed slightly under 500 times — and three of those were by me.

Earlier this month, Media War and Peace writer Evan Shapiro predicted that this would be the year of brands converting from traditional influencer marketing to launching their own content channels. He highlighted recently-launched brand channels or production companies from Under Armour, Procter & Gamble and L’Oréal as examples of this trend coming at a time when ‘the creator economy’ is taking up more and more of people’s consumption hours and brands ‘must become creators themselves’ to compete for attention.

‘There may be influencers and creators on it, but the [brand’s channel] will become an influencer and a creator,’ he said.

These strengths have helped Nvidia achieve remarkable 65.22% revenue growth over the last twelve months, cementing its position as a prominent player in the semiconductor industry.

Piper Sandler also highlighted Nvidia’s favorable valuation at approximately 24.5 times price-to-earnings ratio on a next-twelve-months basis as another factor supporting its bullish stance. While InvestingPro data shows a current P/E of 46.77, the stock’s PEG ratio of 0.78 suggests it’s trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its growth rate. According to InvestingPro’s Fair Value assessment, Nvidia appears slightly undervalued at current levels.

The firm expressed particular enthusiasm about the expected performance gains from Nvidia’s Vera Rubin rack, which is anticipated to generate revenues in the second half of 2026.

In the same research note, Piper Sandler mentioned Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) as likely to benefit most from a recovery in the analog space, and identified Impinj (NASDAQ:PI) as its top small-cap idea with multiple potential catalysts ahead.

In other recent news, Nvidia has maintained its strong position in the market with reaffirmations from major financial analysts. Stifel has reiterated its Buy rating for Nvidia, setting a price target of $250, citing a positive outlook on Nvidia’s sales in China and highlighting the potential impact of H200-based sales on earnings. Similarly, Citi has also reiterated a Buy rating, maintaining a slightly higher price target of $270. In a strategic move, Nvidia is now requiring Chinese clients to make full upfront payments for H200 AI chips, with no options for cancellations or refunds, underscoring the demand and value of these chips.

Additionally, Nvidia’s new Rubin chip has been introduced, showcasing its ability to operate at higher temperatures compared to traditional data center processors. This development could signify a shift in cooling norms within the industry. However, the announcement has led to a 5% drop in Munters shares, as the new chip challenges existing cooling technologies. These recent developments highlight Nvidia’s ongoing influence and strategic maneuvers in the tech industry.

Two of the four major trends the company highlights lean into emotional resonance and genuine experience, which suggests a shift from purely technical capabilities to deeper human storytelling.

One of the trends is termed ‘Connectioneering,’ which explains visuals that stir emotions and spark connection.

According to Adobe, audiences are increasingly drawn to work that reflects shared human experiences and conveys genuine feelings, which is something AI, at its core, cannot truly feel or originate.

This trend stresses that photographers and creatives should focus on emotional impact and human connection in their work.

Authentic cultural storytelling was also a trend termed as local flavors, which is major as it centres on authentic regional and cultural expression. Adobe reports growing demand from brands and enterprises for content that genuinely reflects local identity and experiences.

OpenAI is releasing ChatGPT Health, a dedicated service within the AI chatbot for health-related queries.

The new service is marketed as the secure and a ‘one stop shop’ way of asking ChatGPT personal health questions.

Users can connect their medical records and wellness apps such as Apple Health and MyFitnessPal to ChatGPT, allowing the bot access to analyse the data and output informed responses, according to OpenAI. This can include understanding test results, preparing for appointments, and advice on diet and workouts.

The AI giant added that the service is designed to “support, not replace” medical care.

According to OpenAI, more than 230m people globally ask health and wellness-related questions on ChatGPT every week. However, these are not entirely private.

Speaking in a podcast last year, CEO Sam Altman said that ChatGPT does not offer doctor-patient confidentiality the same way a trained human professional would. “People talk about the most personal shit in their lives to ChatGPT.”

This, he said, could lead to privacy concerns in the case of a lawsuit, because OpenAI would be legally required to produce those conversations. Plus, if left to its default settings, ChatGPT also takes user inputs and content to train its models.

OpenAI claimed that ChatGPT Health tries to mitigate these issues.

The company stated that ChatGPT Health is built with purpose-built encryption and isolation to keep health conversations “protected and compartmentalised”.

Conversations from the service are also not used to train OpenAI’s foundation models, the company said. And although ChatGPT might take data from non-Health chats, OpenAI claims that data shared to Health will not flow back out the other way.

OpenAI added that users can view or delete Health memories at any time within Health or the ‘Personalisation’ section of the service’s settings.

OpenAI said it has worked for more than two years with more than 260 physicians across the world to develop the service. The company claimed that the chatbot has been evaluated against clinical standards set by an assessment framework OpenAI has created specifically for examining health-related outputs.

Interested users outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK can sign up for the waitlist to join ChatGPT Health, which will run with a small cohort of users to refine the experience. The company plans to expand access and make the service available to users across the web and iOS in the coming weeks, it said.

With hundreds of millions using AI chatbots, information shared to ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini and others are not just valuable to the companies providing the services. A security firm recently uncovered a VPN service which captured conversations users were having on AI platforms, selling it for marketing purposes.",https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-doctor.jpeg,N,,2026-01-08 11:05:47.980366

Following the agreement, Uber will integrate TomTom’s maps, Maps APIs and live services across its global platform. The partnership will enhance Uber’s routing, fare calculations, and pick-up and drop-off accuracy, particularly in complex locations such as airports, transit hubs and stadiums. This is expected to reduce travel time and uncertainty while improving reliability and operational efficiency for both drivers and riders.

TomTom’s mapping platform continuously aggregates data from thousands of sources and processes billions of data points to keep maps current. The technological collaboration establishes a feedback loop in which anonymized real-world data from Uber trips is incorporated into TomTom’s maps, improving updates on roads, turn restrictions and closures.

Uber and TomTom are building on their long-standing partnership (the initial deal was inked in 2015) and actively exploring new opportunities to introduce additional location-based tools that will further expand the capabilities of the former’s platform and enhance the overall user experience.

We remind investors that way back in 2015, Uber had looked to buy Nokia's NOK mapping division, HERE, for around $3 billion. The aim of buying Nokia’s mapping division was to gain control of mapping technology for its core services and future self-driving cars. However, Uber ultimately lost its bid to buy Nokia’s mapping service, which was sold to a consortium of German automakers.

Following the failure to buy Nokia’s HERE, Uber partnered with TomTom and also acquired Microsoft's MSFT Bing Maps imagery division, bringing in talent and street-level data for autonomous vehicle development. Through this deal, Uber absorbed data-collection engineers from Microsoft to bolster its mapping work. Roughly 100 Microsoft employees joined Uber following the deal.

The tenure of Kraft Heinz's new Chief Executive, Steve Cahillane, begins with a significant and unexpected hurdle. A sudden shift in U.S. federal dietary guidelines, framed as a renewed offensive against sugar, poses a direct threat to the company's core business and complicates a major corporate restructuring plan already in motion.

Investor sentiment turned cautious following the policy announcement from Washington. Kraft Heinz shares are currently trading at $23.01, hovering near a 52-week low. This nervousness appears sector-wide, with peers like General Mills and Conagra Brands also recording losses. This pattern suggests a potential rotation away from traditional packaged food stocks as the market digests the long-term implications of the new health agenda.

Policy Reversal Targets Core Product Lines

The pressure stems from a pronounced reversal in U.S. health policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership. The administration's updated guidelines now prioritize proteins and healthy fats, explicitly targeting processed foods and added sugars. A specific recommendation to limit consumption to a maximum of 10 grams of sugar per meal strikes at the heart of Kraft Heinz's product portfolio.

This new framework places the company's ""North American Grocery"" segment—home to iconic brands such as Lunchables, Oscar Mayer, and Kool-Aid—under immediate scrutiny. Market observers are not merely flagging a reputational risk but are warning of a tangible danger to a high-volume, core revenue stream.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

Planned Corporate Split Faces New Hurdles

The regulatory development arrives at a critical strategic juncture for Kraft Heinz. The company is planning to separate into two independent publicly traded entities in the second half of 2026: a growth-focused ""Global Taste Elevation"" business (encompassing brands like Heinz and Philadelphia) and the aforementioned ""North American Grocery"" division.

These new guidelines substantially complicate the valuation of the planned grocery spin-off. Should government-backed programs, including public school meal initiatives, align their purchasing with the stricter sugar and processing limits, the segment could face structural revenue declines. This risk may render the spin-off considerably less attractive to potential investors and could force management to reconsider the capital structure of the new entity.

All eyes are now on the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report in February. Analysts anticipate that CEO Cahillane will provide his first detailed commentary on the impact of the evolving political landscape during this update.

Ventyx’ clinical-stage programmes are designed to target vital immune pathways, aiming to achieve greater safety and efficacy than current treatments. The company’s pipeline of small molecule therapies are aimed at treating inflammation in diseases with high unmet medical need, including cardiometabolic, neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders.

Ventyx’ portfolio includes NLRP3 inhibitors that act to block inflammation. Multiple drugs discovered by Ventyx are currently in phase 2 development for recurrent pericarditis, Parkinson’s disease and inflammatory bowel disease.

Daniel M Skovronsky, chief scientific and product officer at Lilly and president of Lilly Research Laboratories, said: “There is increasing evidence that inflammation is a key driver of many chronic diseases.

Raju Mohan, CEO of Ventyx, added: “Our portfolio of NLRP3 inhibitors modulate residual and chronic inflammation that is now recognised as a major risk factor in a host of neuroinflammatory, cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases. We believe that Lilly is an ideal strategic partner…to advance novel therapies that fill a vast unmet need for patients suffering from these debilitating diseases and disorders.”

Ralph Lauren Investment Narrative Recap

To own Ralph Lauren, you need to believe its premium brand, pricing discipline, and capital returns can offset macro and wholesale volatility. The CFDA manufacturing grants are directionally consistent with its brand and supply chain focus, but do not materially change the key near term catalyst of sustaining pricing power or the main risk that softer demand and higher tariffs could pressure margins if consumers become more price sensitive.

The most relevant recent announcement here is Ralph Lauren’s reaffirmed outlook for mid single digit constant currency revenue growth and operating margin expansion in fiscal 2026, which keeps investor attention on execution in core regions rather than on these relatively small manufacturing grants. The grants sit alongside that guidance as one more data point that the company is investing in product and supply capabilities while managing inflation and wholesale rationalization.

Yet investors should be aware that higher prices and tariff costs could collide with...

Ralph Lauren's narrative projects $8.4 billion revenue and $1.0 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 5.0% yearly revenue growth and an earnings increase of roughly $200 million from $794.7 million today.

, in line with its current price.

Exploring Other Perspectives

Six members of the Simply Wall St Community value Ralph Lauren between US$129.83 and US$369.46, showing very different views on its earnings power. Set those against the risk that higher tariffs and industry wide price increases may test consumer demand and potentially influence how sustainably the brand can hold margins and growth, and you have a wide field of opinions to compare before making up your own mind.

New AI-powered capabilities across GenStudio offerings—including GenStudio for Performance Marketing, Firefly Design Intelligence and Firefly Creative Production for Enterprise—simplifies the process of scaling on-brand and personalized content.

Adobe Firefly Foundry provides businesses with private, deeply-tuned AI models across image, video, audio, vector and 3D—securely trained on their proprietary, branded content.

Integrations with advertising partners including Amazon Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Innovid, LinkedIn and TikTok make it seamless for creatives and marketers to activate or optimize display and video ad campaigns.

LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, at Adobe MAX – the world’s largest creativity conference – Adobe (Nasdaq:ADBE) announced major innovations in GenStudio, its integrated solution that enables businesses to power their content supply chain with the latest advancements in AI. GenStudio simplifies one of the most pressing challenges facing creative and marketing teams today, where an insatiable demand for content is outpacing organizational resources. Adobe is addressing this by extending generative AI and AI agents directly into content production workflows, working directly with businesses to create tailored generative AI models, and streamlining experience delivery via integrations with Amazon Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Innovid, LinkedIn and TikTok.

Adobe GenStudio for Performance Marketing.

“GenStudio brings together best-in-class Adobe capabilities for businesses to remain competitive in an attention-based economy, dramatically shortening the time it takes to deliver on-brand experiences at scale,” said Varun Parmar, general manager, Adobe GenStudio and Firefly Enterprise. “Adobe is the technology partner of choice for global businesses because of our deep expertise in bringing together AI, creativity and marketing workflows, providing a unified platform where teams can assemble, activate and optimize content for any channel—all in one place.”

Today, 99% of Fortune 100 companies have used AI in an Adobe app, and nearly 90% of the Top 50 enterprise accounts have adopted one or more of Adobe’s AI-first innovations including GenStudio offerings such as GenStudio for Performance Marketing and Firefly Services. Brands including The Coca-Cola Company, dentsu, The Estée Lauder Companies, Henkel, IBM, IPG Health, Lumen Technologies, Monks, The National Football League, Newell Brands, PepsiCo/Gatorade, Prudential Financial, Publicis Groupe, Qualcomm, Stagwell and Tapestry have been working with Adobe AI-powered offerings such as Firefly and GenStudio to shorten the time it takes to launch campaigns and engage new audiences—activating generative AI and agents to streamline workflows and boost creative output.

New innovations in Adobe GenStudio include:

Scaling and streamlining on-brand content production

Firefly Design Intelligence is a new AI-powered tool for businesses to scale brand and design-compliant content globally. Inspired by a collaboration with The Coca Cola Company, it moves teams beyond static brand guidelines by training “StyleIDs”—design systems that codify complex design and visual identity rules—for use in Creative Cloud apps to generate new layouts and copy, select assets, and arrange components into polished designs.

Firefly Creative Production for Enterprise expands the web app for quickly resizing and reframing thousands of assets. New enterprise-grade capabilities include a workflow builder for creating reusable production workflows, integrations with Adobe Experience Manager Assets and Frame.io to streamline asset importing and exporting, and over 20 generative and creative actions including object compositing and brand checks.

Adobe’s Content Production Agent is now available in beta in GenStudio for Performance Marketing, a generative AI-first app for scaling on-brand ads, emails and more. The agent interprets marketing briefs and automatically produces relevant content for different channels, while aligning with campaign goals and brand guidelines.

Adobe Firefly Services APIs enable businesses to automate and accelerate creative workflows at scale. New offerings now support video reframing and object compositing, while the new Content Authenticity API (beta) embeds verifiable digital credentials at scale to protect brand integrity.

Firefly Custom Models enable businesses to train Firefly on select images to create customized, brand consistent content for select marketing use cases. Integration with Firefly Boards now drives visually consistent and on-brand ideation, while new self-serve enhancements make it easier for teams to adopt and use Custom Models.

Delivering proprietary and on-brand generative AI models

Adobe Firefly Foundry enables businesses to work directly with Adobe and create tailored generative AI models that are unique to their brand. Trained on entire catalogs of existing IP, these proprietary Adobe Firefly Foundry models are deeply tuned and can be built on top of commercially safe Adobe Firefly models. This unlocks the value of AI, helping teams scale on-brand content production, create new customer experiences and extend their IP. With Firefly as the anchor, Adobe Firefly Foundry models can support all major asset types including image, video, audio, vector and 3D—accelerating content delivery for brand campaigns, performance marketing, media production workflows and more.

Activating and optimizing campaigns across ad partners

In GenStudio for Performance Marketing, teams can now automatically assemble, activate and optimize experiences across a variety of major advertising platforms. Expanded partnerships and integrations that are available now include:

Amazon Ads: Activate display ads directly with Amazon Ads (Generally available)

Innovid: Activate and measure display ad campaigns, with performance insights to optimize creative and drive better engagement (Available in beta)

Google: Activate video ads directly with Google Campaign Manager 360 in Google Marketing Platform (Coming soon in beta)

If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.

An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

(January 8, 2026) – Johnson & Johnson today announced Tony Hunter, Ph.D., of the Salk Institute as the recipient of the 2025 Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research. Dr. Hunter is honored for his role in the discovery of tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphorylation as mechanisms for the malignant transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and other disease states.

“Dr. Hunter’s discoveries are the cornerstone upon which today’s cancer therapies have been built,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine R&D for Johnson & Johnson. “His groundbreaking work embodies the legacy and spirit of Dr. Paul Janssen and J&J’s ongoing commitment to cancer research – addressing patient needs and improving health for all.”

Dr. Hunter’s seminal discovery four decades ago paved the way for the development of more than 80 cancer therapies and sparked innovation in neuroimmunology, neurology, hematology, and autoimmune disorders. His lab at the Salk Institute continues to lead the field in understanding how chemical additions to proteins control the cell cycle and growth, leading to new potential therapeutic targets for cancers.

An independent committee of world-renowned scientists selected Dr. Hunter for this recognition. He joins 25 other scientists who have received the Dr. Paul Janssen Award since 2004, including ten who have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.

“Dr. Hunter’s work stood out to the selection committee for its foundational impact in addressing one of the most pressing medical questions of our generation: Why do cancers thrive, and how do we stop them from growing? His discoveries have already made a great impact, and they continue to pave the way for new innovations in cancer therapies, improving outcomes for patients worldwide,” said Elaine Fuchs, Ph.D., Selection Committee Chair for the Dr. Paul Janssen Award. “As in every year, we had an impressive slate of researchers nominated for their exceptional work in the field of biomedical research.”

Johnson & Johnson will honor Dr. Hunter during a virtual symposium, cohosted with The New York Academy of Sciences on March 2, 2026. The symposium is free to anyone interested in celebrating scientific innovation. (Registration is required.)

“I am delighted to receive the Dr. Paul Janssen Award for Biomedical Research,” Hunter said. “I discovered tyrosine phosphorylation as a cancer mechanism while carrying out studies with a simple chicken tumor virus, hoping our findings would give us clues as to how human cancer develops. This serendipitous discovery led to a whole new class of cancer drugs and underscores the importance of funding for basic biomedical research, which can lead to other breakthrough cancer treatments.”

The Dr. Paul Janssen Award builds on Dr. Hunter’s extensive list of international scientific awards and recognitions, including the AACR Lifetime Achievement Award in Cancer Research, the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Sjöberg Prize, among others.

The share price has been choppy recently, with a 1-day share price return of 2.19% decline, but the 90-day share price return of 30.78% suggests momentum has been building even as the 3-year total shareholder return of 28.36% decline shows a tougher longer term picture.

The share price has been choppy recently, with a 1-day share price return of 2.19% decline, but the 90-day share price return of 30.78% suggests momentum has been building even as the 3-year total shareholder return of 28.36% decline shows a tougher longer term picture.

If HP’s swings have you rethinking your energy exposure, it could be a good moment to widen the search and look at as potential next ideas.

So with HP trading close to analyst targets but still showing a large modelled intrinsic discount and a mixed return profile, is this a reset that opens up value, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 0% Overvalued

Helmerich & Payne’s most followed narrative sees fair value at about US$30.27 per share, very close to the recent US$30.38 close. This frames an almost fully reflected valuation in the current price.

The company's growing international footprint, highlighted by the successful KCA integration and new tender opportunities in Saudi Arabia and Argentina, positions H&P to capture incremental market share and expand EBITDA as geopolitical instability and supply concerns reinforce demand for high-spec rigs.

Curious what underpins that near one to one match between model and market? Revenue, margins and a richer future earnings multiple all carry weight here.

Result: Fair Value of $30.27 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, you still need to weigh risks like potential rig overcapacity and H&P’s heavy North American exposure, which could pressure utilization, day rates, and cash generation.

Another View: Multiples Still Point To Value

While the popular narrative pegs Helmerich & Payne as roughly fairly priced, the pricing based on sales tells a different story. The current P/S ratio of 0.8x sits below both the fair ratio of 0.9x and the peer and industry averages of 1.2x and 1.1x. That gap suggests the market is assigning a discount that could either indicate caution or potential mispricing. Which side do you think it is?

(Adapture), a utility-scale solar and energy storage developer, owner, and operator, today announced the closing of $233 million in tax equity financing commitments from U.S. Bank for two solar projects within its Titanium portfolio.

'This tax equity close reflects the strong economic fundamentals of these solar assets, our ability to construct them efficiently and the growing depth of expertise in the organization,' said Thomas Houghton, CEO and President of Adapture

This commitment marks a major milestone as Adapture advances toward construction completion and commercial operation of the multi-site portfolio. Last year, the company announced a $321 million construction and tax credit bridge facility with MUFG, supporting the broader 441 MW Titanium portfolio, which spans three project sites in Arkansas and Illinois.

'This tax equity close reflects the strong economic fundamentals of these solar assets, our ability to construct them efficiently and the growing depth of expertise in the organization,' said Thomas Houghton, CEO and President of Adapture. 'We are pleased to further our long-standing partnership with U.S. Bank with these projects as we continue delivering high-quality, reliable solar assets to the market.'

U.S. Bank's tax equity investments are a critical source of funding for project construction. 'U.S. Bank invests in renewable energy projects that help strengthen the energy grid and drive local job creation,' said Eric Barr, senior vice president, Environmental Finance, U.S. Bank. 'We are proud to support our long-standing customer Adapture with our tax equity financing and expertise as it expands its Titanium portfolio and delivers clean energy generation.'

'Our teams worked closely and diligently to bring this over the finish line,' said Ben Schneider, Managing Director of Project Finance at Adapture. 'This closing is another major step forward for the Titanium projects, and we are grateful to the team at U.S. Bank for continuing to be a crucial partner in the growth of Adapture's portfolio.'

Construction began on the Titanium portfolio in September 2024, and the first projects are expected to reach commercial operation this year. Once operational, the portfolio is expected to generate enough electricity to power more than 71,000 homes annually.

The developments, which were first reported by FAIQ, Citywire and InvestmentNews, come as competition in the mid-tier wealth management segment heats up. Schwab significantly raised the barriers to entry for its own referral network late last month, doubling minimum AUM requirements to $500 million. While Schwab pivoted toward larger firms and wealthier clients (asset minimums now begin at $2 million instead of $500,000), BNY is keeping a more open-door policy:

Advisors using the Advisor Match service will face no AUM minimums.

There will be an annual fee of $50,000 and an annual asset-based fee of as much as 0.3% based on the value of the assets of the referred client, a potential barrier for advisors with less affluent customers.

For now, as the AI rally shows signs of fatigue, Wall Street’s attention is increasingly turning to the US consumer.","Strategists on Wall Street are increasingly looking beyond the artificial intelligence trade for fresh drivers of the US equity rally, as concerns grow that enthusiasm for AI-linked stocks may be cooling.

Attention is now shifting toward companies tied to middle-income consumer spending, which some investors see as better positioned to benefit from a broadening economic expansion in 2026.

A team at Goldman Sachs Group, led by strategist Ben Snider, has identified a range of stocks that could gain as household finances improve and spending accelerates.

Their focus is not on essential goods alone, but increasingly on discretionary products and services that consumers buy when confidence rises.

Goldman targets middle-income consumer spending

In a note to investors dated January 6, Snider and his colleagues argued that stocks exposed to middle-income consumers are “particularly attractive” at this stage of the cycle.

The team expects real income growth for this group to accelerate, which will support higher sales growth for companies with steady demand and relatively thin margins.

Goldman’s preferred sectors include healthcare providers, materials producers, and makers of everyday consumer goods.

However, the strongest conviction lies with businesses selling “nice-to-have” products rather than necessities.

This includes retailers of upscale apparel and accessories, household goods manufacturers, tour operators, and casinos.

The call reflects Goldman’s broader expectation that value stocks will continue to outperform into early 2026.

According to the firm, easing pressure from tariffs introduced under President Donald Trump, a stabilising labour market, and tax rebates linked to last year’s major legislation should all help underpin consumer spending.

Retail stocks gain as investors rotate away from AI

The shift in sentiment comes as investors look for alternatives to the AI trade that has dominated markets for the past three years, largely driven by the so-called “Magnificent Seven” technology companies.

With valuations stretched in parts of the tech sector, some investors are increasingly exploring areas that have lagged in recent years.

The S&P Retail Select Industry Index, which includes companies such as CarMax, Etsy, and Academy Sports & Outdoors, is already showing signs of renewed interest.

The index is up 3.5% since the start of the year and has gained 8.8% since early November, coinciding with the peak holiday shopping season.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the US economy to grow by 2.1% this year, with consumer spending providing a key boost.

This outlook has supported a gradual rotation into more traditional value-oriented sectors.

“There is a repricing of economic growth higher,” said Charlie McElligott, cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities International.

He added that such a shift tends to favour value stocks over higher-priced growth names.

Dick’s Sporting Goods highlights early winners

One early beneficiary of the rotation has been Dick’s Sporting Goods.

Shares in the US retailer have risen 6.1% in the first four trading days of 2026, recovering some of the ground lost in 2025, when the stock fell 13%.

Options activity suggests some investors are betting on further gains.

Susquehanna International Group, in a Bloomberg report, said a recent trade could generate up to $3.5 million if the stock moves back toward its early-2025 high of $250 a share.

Dick’s is among several retailers highlighted by Goldman as having strong exposure to rising middle-class wealth, alongside Burlington Stores, Best Buy, Five Below, Levi Strauss, and Gap.

While traditional retailers continue to face competition from e-commerce giants, the search for value amid lofty tech valuations appears to be drawing investor interest elsewhere.

For now, as the AI rally shows signs of fatigue, Wall Street’s attention is increasingly turning to the US consumer.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 11:15:46.885030

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation.","If you are wondering whether Eli Lilly's share price still makes sense at around US$1,108, you are not alone. Many investors are asking what they are really paying for at this level.

The stock has recently posted returns of 3.1% over the last 7 days, 11.1% over the last 30 days, 2.6% year to date, 41.8% over the last year and a very large gain over 5 years, which naturally raises questions about growth potential and changes in perceived risk.

Recent headlines have focused on Eli Lilly's weight loss and diabetes treatments, which have been a key talking point for the company and the sector. Media coverage has often linked these products to investor interest, helping frame how the market is thinking about the current share price.

Our valuation work gives Eli Lilly a . Next we will walk through the main valuation approaches investors commonly use and then finish with a different way of thinking about what the stock could be worth.

Eli Lilly scores just 1/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the .

Approach 1: Eli Lilly Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company could be worth by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those back to today using a required rate of return. It is essentially asking what those future dollars are worth in current terms.

For Eli Lilly, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach. The latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $6.2b. Analysts supply detailed Free Cash Flow estimates for several years, and Simply Wall St then extrapolates further to build a 10 year path, reaching a projected Free Cash Flow of $59.2b in 2035. These projections, all in $, are then discounted to arrive at a single estimate of value per share.

On this basis, Eli Lilly’s DCF fair value is calculated at US$1,253.18 per share, compared with a current share price of about US$1,108. That implies an intrinsic discount of roughly 11.6%, which indicates that the shares are trading below this cash flow based estimate of value.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Eli Lilly is undervalued by 11.6%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Eli Lilly Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Eli Lilly, the P/E ratio is a straightforward way to think about what you are paying for each dollar of earnings. It links directly to the bottom line, which is usually what ultimately matters to shareholders.

What counts as a “normal” or “fair” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk profile. Higher expected growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher risk tends to go with a lower P/E.

Eli Lilly currently trades on about 53.89x earnings, compared with the Pharmaceuticals industry average of about 19.90x and a peer group average of about 16.96x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Eli Lilly is 42.45x. This Fair Ratio is a proprietary estimate of what the P/E might be, given factors such as earnings growth, profit margins, industry, market cap and identified risks.

Because the Fair Ratio incorporates those company specific drivers, it can be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry. With the current P/E of 53.89x sitting above the Fair Ratio of 42.45x, the shares screen as expensive on this metric.

Result: OVERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Eli Lilly Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to think about valuation. On Simply Wall St that starts with Narratives, which are your own story for Eli Lilly that links what you believe about its GLP 1 opportunity, risks and margins to a forecast for revenue, earnings and cash flows, and then to a fair value you can compare with today’s price.

On the Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an easy tool to set their assumptions and see a live fair value that updates when new earnings, news or regulatory developments come through. This means you can always see how fresh information might affect your view.

For Eli Lilly right now, one Narrative on the platform uses a fair value of about US$1,189 per share, while another uses about US$1,093. This shows how two investors can look at the same company and reach different, but clearly explained, conclusions based on their own expectations and discount rates.

For Eli Lilly however we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Eli Lilly Narratives:

Each one ties the same core facts about GLP 1 demand, pricing, and policy into a different conclusion about what the current US$1,108.09 share price could mean for you.

🐂 Eli Lilly Bull Case

Fair value used in this Narrative: about US$1,189.18 per share

Implied discount to this fair value: about 6.8% below the Narrative value

Revenue growth assumption: 20%

Tirzepatide drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound are treated as the core engine for earnings, with numbers cited for 2024 to 2026 sales expectations and a focus on capacity expansion to meet demand.

The author highlights long patent protection, low GLP 1 penetration in a 100m to 120m U.S. addressable market and gradually improving insurance coverage as key supports for the story.

Risks flagged include high monthly pricing, new entrants, potential side effects and lawsuits, and a high current P/E, but the Narrative still arrives at a fair value around US$1,200 based on 20% to 25% revenue growth over 3 to 5 years and a 9% discount rate.

🐻 Eli Lilly Bear Case

Fair value used in this Narrative: about US$1,093.22 per share

Implied premium to this fair value: about 1.4% above the Narrative value

Revenue growth assumption: 18.12%

This Narrative leans on analyst assumptions that revenue grows at about 18.7% a year over 3 years, profit margins widen from 25.9% to 38.4% and earnings reach US$34.2b by around September 2028, but questions whether the P/E can stay at a premium level.

It stresses concentration in a handful of GLP 1 products, exposure to drug price controls and reimbursement decisions, and competition from generics, compounders and other large pharma as possible sources of pressure on margins and volumes.

With a consensus price target of US$891.62 based on those earnings, margin and discount rate assumptions, it concludes that investors need to be comfortable with policy risk, execution risk on manufacturing scale up and litigation overhangs to justify paying close to or above US$1,100.

If you feel one of these fits how you think Eli Lilly’s story plays out, you can use it as a starting point to build or adjust your own assumptions, rather than relying only on a single fair value number.

Do you think there's more to the story for Eli Lilly?

Johnson & Johnson Investment Narrative Recap

To own Johnson & Johnson today, you need to believe in its ability to replace maturing blockbusters with a broad mix of new medicines and MedTech products while managing legal and cost pressures. The latest nipocalimab and OTTAVA updates support that pipeline story, but they do not materially change the near term focus on how loss of exclusivity, litigation and orthopedics restructuring shape earnings and cash generation over the next few years.

Among recent announcements, the positive Phase 2b JASMINE data for nipocalimab in systemic lupus erythematosus stands out, as it reinforces Johnson & Johnson’s emphasis on Innovative Medicine as a key growth driver. For investors tracking catalysts, this lupus program sits alongside other immunology and oncology efforts as part of the broader effort to offset STELARA erosion and support the company’s long running dividend profile.

Yet beneath these promising updates, investors should be aware that ongoing talc litigation risk could still...

Investors responded to Zeta pushing its platform beyond reporting and orchestration tools toward something closer to an operating layer for marketing decisions.

At the centre of its shift is Athena, Zeta’s AI agent, which the company is expanding by integrating OpenAI’s models. The intent is to let marketing teams interact with data and campaign systems using natural language, rather than navigating dashboards, queries, and rule sets. Features like Insights and Advisor, currently in beta, are designed to answer questions, surface patterns, and suggest actions in campaigns.

The move is about product direction. For enterprise brands that rely on platforms like Zeta to run large parts of their marketing operations, it is about something more practical: how work gets done when analysis, guidance, and execution start to blur into a single layer.

When marketing platforms start to guide decisions, not just report results

Marketing teams already sit on vast amounts of data. Performance metrics, audience behaviour, channel results, and spend information are usually available in near real time. The challenge has never been access alone, but interpretation. Turning that data into decisions still requires time, people, and coordination in teams. AI agents are being positioned as a way to compress that cycle.

Instead of asking analysts to pull reports or waiting for weekly reviews, teams could ask why performance shifted, which audiences changed, or how a budget tweak might affect outcomes. The system can respond using the data already inside the platform, framed in language that non-technical users can act on.

That shift sounds incremental, but it changes the role of marketing technology inside an organisation. Platforms stop being places where work is reviewed after the fact and start acting as environments where decisions are shaped as campaigns run.

Where AI agents fit – and where they don’t

Still, what this enables is not the same as what it replaces. Strategy, creative direction, and brand judgement remain human responsibilities. Zeta’s AI tools are framed as support layers, not substitutes. The agent may suggest actions, but teams retain control over whether and how those actions are taken.

Enterprise marketing does not operate in a vacuum: Campaigns are shaped by legal constraints, brand rules, regional differences, and commercial priorities that rarely fit cleanly into automated logic. Any system that oversteps the boundaries risks slowing adoption.

Another tension emanates from the trust factor. As AI agents move closer to execution, marketing leaders will need to understand how suggestions are generated and what data is being used. The promise of speed only holds if teams are confident they can explain and defend decisions made with AI support. Black-box recommendations, even if accurate, can be hard to justify in regulated or high-risk environments.

The OpenAI partnership highlights a dependency shift. Brands are becoming indirect users of large models, even if they never interact with them directly. Model updates, behaviour changes, and reliability issues can ripple into daily operations. That raises questions about resilience and oversight that go beyond marketing teams alone.

For many organisations, adoption will likely be uneven. Some teams may use AI agents to explore data or draft scenarios, while others keep them confined to narrow tasks. The same platform may be used very differently in regions or business units, depending on risk tolerance and maturity.

What Zeta’s move shows is not that AI-driven marketing is ready to run itself, but that the centre of gravity is shifting. Marketing technology isn’t about collecting data and measuring outcomes, but is becoming a space where interpretation, suggestion, and action coexist.

The decision is not whether to use tools like Athena, but how much authority to grant them. As AI agents become part of the infrastructure rather than optional features, teams will need to define clear guardrails, approval paths, and success measures that go beyond speed or efficiency.

IBM and The All England Lawn Tennis Club announce a multi-year renewal of their long-standing technology partnership.

From the launch of the Wimbledon website in 1995 and the mobile application in 2009, to the first integration of enhanced AI-powered solutions in 2017, IBM and the All England Club have collaborated for 36 years to deepen global fan engagement across Wimbledon’s digital platforms.

The successful partnership between IBM and the All England Club has created engaging fan-facing features that have elevated tech innovation in the sport. The new agreement is focused on initiatives to expand the event’s global reach and achieve a deeper fan engagement across Wimbledon’s digital ecosystem in 2026 and beyond.

Teams from IBM and the All England Club work together year-round to co-create unique fan experiences — such as Live Likelihood to Win and Match Chat — that combine the significant quantity of data generated during The Championships with the deep AI capabilities of IBM watsonx. In 2025, these efforts contributed to a 16% year-on-year increase in engagement across all platforms, with more than 20 million fans closely following all the grass court action via the app and website. The app alone saw a 19% increase in engagement and received an average rating of 4.9 stars in app stores.

The partnership has also won multiple awards, including the All England Club being recognized as ‘Sports Organization of the Year’ at the 2025 Sports Technology Awards, for the innovative use of AI and technology to transform the Wimbledon fan experience.

“We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,” says Usama Al-Qassab, Marketing & Commercial Director, The All England Lawn Tennis Club. “For 36 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships. As we look to attract the next generation of Wimbledon fans from around the world, the AI-powered capabilities of IBM will be key to ensuring our future digital experiences are relevant, personalized and engaging.”

“The All England Club is a visionary organization, delivering one of the most globally recognizable properties in sport and broader culture. We are thrilled to continue working in lockstep as partners to serve up a world-class digital experience, driven by leading edge data and AI technology,” says Jonathan Adashek, Senior Vice President, Marketing and Communications, IBM. “Whether onsite at SW19 or following from any corner of the globe for years to come, hundreds of millions of tennis fans can rely on having interactive digital features, powered by watsonx, to stay connected to the beauty, drama and excitement of The Championships.”

The companies plan to begin offering passenger rides in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year, marking a significant step toward large-scale robotaxi deployment.

Each partner plays a distinct role in the project. Lucid supplies the vehicle platform, using its Gravity electric SUV as the foundation. Nuro contributes the autonomous driving system, replacing the human driver with its software-based Nuro Driver. Uber integrates the vehicle into its ride-hailing ecosystem, giving riders access through the familiar Uber app.

In practice, this means customers could soon be picked up by a self-driving Lucid vehicle ordered like any other Uber ride.

The Gravity-based robotaxi, unveiled at CES 2026, has been extensively modified for autonomous operation. Classified as a Level 4 vehicle, it is designed to handle most driving situations independently within defined areas. To achieve this, the vehicle relies on a comprehensive sensor suite combining cameras, radar, and LiDAR.

These sensors are seamlessly integrated into the vehicle’s body, along with a roof-mounted “halo” module that provides a full 360-degree view of the surroundings.

At the core of the system is the Nuro Driver software running on Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computing platform. This setup processes vast amounts of sensor data in real time, enabling the vehicle to make rapid and safe driving decisions. Road testing of the autonomous Gravity began in December, laying the groundwork for its commercial rollout.

Passenger experience has been a major focus. The roof-mounted halo includes external displays that show riders’ initials as the vehicle approaches, making it easy to identify in crowded locations.

Inside, passengers sit in the second row and are welcomed by a screen that displays their name, route, and trip details. Riders remain in control, initiating the journey themselves by tapping a “Start Drive” command.

During the trip, the screen explains the vehicle’s actions, such as yielding to pedestrians or changing lanes, helping build confidence and transparency. Climate controls, heated seats, and media settings are also accessible, along with options to contact support or request a safe stop.

Designed for practicality, the robotaxi can accommodate up to six passengers with generous luggage space. Lucid is expected to begin production of the autonomous vehicles at its Arizona facility later this year. Uber aims to deploy as many as 20,000 of these robotaxis over six years, with expansion planned across multiple global markets.",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/uber_robotaxi_dd5babafbd.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 14:02:24.908479

Nvidia (NVDA) is tightening its sales terms in China, asking customers to pay the full amount up front for its H200 AI chips, according to a Reuters report. The move comes as Beijing has yet to clearly approve shipments, creating risk around delivery timelines.

Under the new terms, Chinese buyers must pay the full amount upfront when placing an order. Once submitted, orders cannot be canceled, refunded, or changed. In certain cases, customers may use commercial insurance or pledged assets as collateral to secure payment instead of paying the full amount in cash. Nvidia and China’s industry ministry have not commented on the policy yet.

China Approval Delays Push Nvidia to Toughen Terms

The tougher terms reflect uncertainty in China’s approval process. While Nvidia has long asked for advance payments from Chinese clients, it previously allowed partial deposits. For the H200, the company is being stricter because it is unclear when regulators will allow shipments.

Adding to the delay, Chinese authorities have asked local tech firms to pause new orders for Nvidia’s H200 chips, which Washington recently approved for export to China. Chinese government regulators are deciding how many locally made chips companies must buy along with each H200 order, which has slowed approvals.

Nvidia Sees Strong H200 Demand Despite China Hurdles

Despite the hurdles, demand remains strong. Chinese companies have placed orders for more than 2 million H200 chips, priced at about $27,000 each, far above Nvidia’s current inventory of 700,000 chips.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the H200 chip remains “quite high” and that the company has ramped up its supply chain. Notably, the H200 delivers much stronger performance than the now-blocked H20 and still outperforms most domestic chips for large-scale AI training.

Nvidia Shifts Risk to Buyers

Nvidia has reason to be cautious. Last year, the company took a $5.5 billion inventory write-down after a sudden export ban on earlier chips. While U.S. policy now allows H200 sales with a fee paid to Washington, China has since blocked H20 shipments, keeping the risk high.

By asking for full payment upfront, Nvidia protects itself if approvals are delayed again. The financial risk now sits with buyers, who must commit cash without certainty on delivery.

Is NVDA Stock a Buy?

On TipRanks, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 39 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell rating. The average Nvidia price target of $263.76 implies 39.5% upside potential from current levels. Over the past year, NVDA stock has gained nearly 35%.

Investors see the country as a big opportunity—but getting there has been a challenge.
CFO Colette Kress said Tuesday that the U.S. government is ""working feverishly"" on the details, and the company expects to begin shipping to China soon.
The chipmaker's latest forecasts did not take China sales of the H200, or H20 that Trump greenlighted back in August, into consideration.
The approvals also face opposition at home, with bipartisan efforts by U.S. lawmakers in recent weeks to block the sales.","Will Nvidia ever get to sell more of its AI chips in China? Investors see the country as a big opportunity—but getting there has been a challenge.

CEO Jensen Huang said this week that Nvidia (NVDA) is looking forward to selling its H200 AI chip in China after winning President Donald Trump's approval in exchange for agreeing to give the U.S. government a 25% cut of sales. CFO Colette Kress said Tuesday that the U.S. government is ""working feverishly"" on the details, and the company expects to begin shipping to China soon.

But the Chinese government's latest moves to halt sales could hobble those plans. Beijing has ordered companies to halt H200 orders, and could follow with a mandate that firms buy domestic chips instead, The Information reported Wednesday. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, the company is imposing more stringent terms on Chinese clients looking to buy the H200 amid the uncertainty, such as full upfront payment without options to cancel, according to a Reuters report Thursday. Nvidia did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication.

More access to China's market, which Huang has said could be a $50 billion annual opportunity for Nvidia, would represent a significant source of growth for the company. (Nvidia is expected to report full-year revenue above $210 billion.) The chipmaker's latest forecasts did not take China sales of the H200, or H20 that Trump greenlighted back in August, into consideration.

The H20, a less-powerful chip designed specifically for China's market, has also met challenges from Beijing after receiving Trump's backing. The approvals also face opposition at home, with bipartisan efforts by U.S. lawmakers in recent weeks to block the sales.

In a note to clients Tuesday, analysts at Morgan Stanley nodded to possible sales of the AI chips in China as a source of potential upside for the company, but excluded them from their base case for the stock amid lingering worries about political barriers. Analysts at Jefferies and Bernstein, who like Morgan Stanley hold ""buy"" or equivalent ratings on the stock, have also voiced some skepticism about the likelihood of sales.

Shares of Nvidia slid about 2% in Thursday morning trading, leaving them little changed for 2026 after climbing close to 40% last year.

Second IDE approved for U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures

NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Johnson & Johnson today announced that the company has submitted the OTTAVA™ Robotic Surgical System to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in an application for De Novo classification. Leveraging data from the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, the company has applied for marketing authorization in multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen.

“We have taken learnings from Johnson & Johnson’s 140 years in surgery, our decades of leadership in minimally invasive surgery, and the experiences robotic surgeons and hospitals have had over the past 20 years to design a soft tissue robotic system built for the future of surgery,” said Hani Abouhalka, Company Group Chair, Surgery, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “I am proud of the design decisions and major scientific efforts that have gone into the system to support surgeons and successfully complete our first clinical trial, and I look forward to reaching the next milestone on our path to commercialization.”

Data from first clinical trial supporting submission

First cases in the OTTAVA IDE study were completed in early 2025 at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center by Dr. Erik Wilson*, Chief of Minimally Invasive and Elective General Surgery UT Health Houston and the lead investigator for the clinical study.

OTTAVA’s unique unified architecture, surgical instrumentation powered by Ethicon expertise, and future connection to the Polyphonic™ digital ecosystem are designed to address the unmet needs of surgeons and their teams. The Company filed data from the completed clinical trial with the aim of showcasing safety and effectiveness and supporting the system’s ability to perform a variety of procedures. Given OTTAVA’s novel architecture and differentiated technological capabilities, the company filed a De Novo classification request and is targeting an indication covering multiple procedures in general surgery within the upper abdomen, such as gastric bypass, gastric sleeve, small bowel resection and hiatal hernia repair.

“The IDE study builds on a significant body of preclinical evidence we have generated demonstrating the impact of the OTTAVA system and provides critical clinical evidence on the system performance,” said Peter Schulam, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer, MedTech, Johnson & Johnson. “Surgeon investigators across several hospitals led this important study to further clinical evidence in support of minimally invasive, robotic-assisted surgery for the benefit of clinical teams, hospitals, and patients.”

Second clinical trial approved in hernia repair

OTTAVA is designed as a multi-specialty soft-tissue surgery robot, supporting a broad range of procedures across patient anatomy and surgical specialties, including the most complex surgeries that require a multi-quadrant approach. In late 2025, Johnson & Johnson received IDE approval to begin a U.S. clinical trial for OTTAVA in inguinal hernia procedures, one of the most common surgeries in the U.S.1

The OTTAVA robotic system is under development and is not authorized to be marketed or sold in any market. For more information, visit: http://thenext.jnjmedtech.com/surgical-robotics.

NEW YORK (AP) — Warner Bros. again rejected a takeover bid from Paramount and told shareholders Wednesday to stick with a rival offer from Netflix.

Warner’s leadership has repeatedly rebuffed Skydance-owned Paramount’s overtures — and urged shareholders just weeks ago to back the sale of its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. Paramount, meanwhile, has made efforts to sweeten its $77.9 billion hostile offer for the entire company.

Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday that its board determined Paramount’s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.

“Paramount’s offer continues to provide insufficient value, including terms such as an extraordinary amount of debt financing that create risks to close and lack of protections for our shareholders if a transaction is not completed,” Warner Bros. Discovery Chair Samuel Di Piazza Jr. said in a statement. In contrast, he added, the company’s agreement with Netflix “will offer superior value at greater levels of certainty.”

Paramount did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s hostile bid is still on the table. Warner shareholders currently have until Jan. 21 to “tender” their shares.

Late last month, Paramount announced an “irrevocable personal guarantee” from Oracle founder Larry Ellison — who is the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison — to back $40.4 billion in equity financing for the company’s offer. Paramount also increased its promised payout to shareholders to $5.8 billion if the deal is blocked by regulators, matching Netflix’s breakup fee.

In its Wednesday letter to shareholders, Warner expressed concerns about a potential deal with Paramount. Warner said it essentially considers the offer a leveraged buyout, which includes a lot of debt, and also pointed to operating restrictions that it said were imposed by Paramount’s offer and could “hamper WBD’s ability to perform” throughout a transaction.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount wants the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes networks like CNN and Discovery.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s news and cable operations would be spun off into their own company, under a previously-announced separation.

A merger with either company could take over a year to close — and will attract tremendous antitrust scrutiny along the way. Due to its size and potential impact, it will almost certainly trigger a review by the U.S. Justice Department, which could sue to block the transaction or request changes. Other countries and regulators overseas may also challenge the merger. And politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

The Latina plant, which employs approximately 300 people, produces a wide range of infant food and specialised nutrition products, including roughly 1.8 million Plasmon items annually.

Under a co-packing agreement, the facility will continue to produce Heinz Baby Food for the UK market.

As of 31 December 2024, Plasmon reported revenues of around €170 million and an EBITDA of €17 million.

For NewPrinces, this deal significantly strengthens its presence in the baby and specialised food market, particularly across Italy and Europe.

The company expects that the acquisition will drive increased revenue and profit margins, with expected annual revenue growth of around 3% and EBITDA margins reaching 15% in the medium term.

Additionally, it will increase production capacity by combining the Latina plant with NewPrinces’ Ozzano Taro facility and expand Plasmon’s international footprint.

Princes Italia

Princes Italia (a NewPrinces subsidiary) will operate Plasmon’s business under a three-year lease agreement, paying €3 million in annual rent plus 1.5% of revenues.

Angelo Mastrolia, chairman of NewPrinces, commented, ""Bringing home brands like Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten, and Dieterba—which have deep roots in our country's identity—alongside a highly efficient production plant such as the Latina factory, solidifies our position as a leading platform in the high-margin baby and specialised food segment in Italy and Europe.”",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvZXNtbWFnYXppbmUtcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjZcXFwvMDFcXFwvMDcxNjA1MjRcXFwvUGxhc21vbi5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6MTIwMCxcImhlaWdodFwiOjYyNyxcImRlZmF1bHRcIjpcImh0dHBzOlxcXC9cXFwvaW1nLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6ImZjZjdjODY5Mzk1N2U4NWYwYjc5OTRhNGZkNWYzZDdlYTNkOWNlMGQifQ==/newprinces-group-completes-plasmon-acquisition.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 03:13:22.169174

For fiscal 2026, the company is guiding to a low-single-digit decline in that segment.","Economists use “K-shaped recovery” to describe divergence, where one part of an economy improves while another crumbles. The term gained traction during the pandemic to describe unequal post-COVID outcomes across income groups, sectors and firms. Now the concept fits the fortunes of lab equipment companies, among other things. Major vendors have posted strong numbers in recent earnings, yet the mood among academic researchers remains more muted.

The destocking hangover ends

For equipment suppliers, a single word defined the past two years: destocking. After pandemic-era stockpiling left pharmaceutical and biotech customers sitting on excess inventory, order volumes collapsed. Companies burned through their safety stocks.

That headwind has finally eased. Thermo Fisher Scientific reported Q3 2025 revenue of $11.1 billion, with its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment generating nearly $6 billion. Danaher, the bioprocessing bellwether, noted “continued momentum” in its filtration and purification business during its Q3 call. Agilent Technologies posted 7.2% core revenue growth in its Q4 fiscal 2025, with management highlighting strength in industrial and applied markets (chemicals, advanced materials, and environmental testing) as a counterweight to softer life sciences demand.

Drug manufacturing is non-discretionary. You cannot produce a dose of a GLP-1 agonist or a monoclonal antibody without consuming filtration media, chromatography resins, and single-use bags. As biologic pipelines advance and production scales, consumables follow.

The NIH question mark

The academic side of the market, in some respects faces more acute challenges. In February 2025, NIH announced a policy capping indirect cost reimbursement at 15% of grant awards. For research universities accustomed to negotiated rates of 50% or higher, the implications were severe. SUNY estimated an immediate $79 million hit to its research enterprise.

But the policy never took effect. Twenty-two states sued, and a federal judge blocked implementation in February 2025. A nationwide injunction followed in March. On January 5, 2026, an appeals court upheld that injunction, meaning the cap remains legally stalled.

The result is more limbo than crisis. University administrators, uncertain whether the cap will eventually survive judicial review, have adopted conservative postures. Capital expenditure decisions that might have been routine (a new mass spectrometer for a core facility, an upgrade to the microscopy suite) now face additional scrutiny.

The numbers bear this out. In Agilent’s Q4 fiscal 2025 results, released November 24, academia and government revenue declined 10%. For fiscal 2026, the company is guiding to a low-single-digit decline in that segment. Pharma, by contrast, grew 12% in the same quarter.

Where the money flows

Recurring revenue streams (consumables, service contracts, reagent kits) remain robust regardless of capital budget cycles. Companies with exposure to industrial and applied markets have found insulation from academic uncertainty. Semiconductor manufacturing, battery R&D and PFAS testing regulations are driving demand for analytical instrumentation on a separate track from NIH funding dynamics.

Bioprocessing consumables, pharma services and industrial applications are carrying the sector. Academic researchers, meanwhile, are waiting on Washington and the courts. For them, 2026 may be another year on the sidelines.",https://www.rdworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-8.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 04:00:11.419245

The device, which HP characterized as the world's first full AI PC built into a keyboard form factor, aims to address growing enterprise demand for computing hardware that adapts to increasingly fluid work environments.

The EliteBoard G1a integrates a complete desktop-class PC—including an AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processor delivering over 50 TOPS of neural processing power—into a keyboard chassis measuring just 12mm thick and weighing 750 grams, according to HP. The device functions as a standalone Copilot+ PC that connects to any display, fundamentally changing the traditional desktop paradigm by making high-performance computing fully portable.

""Work is being redesigned in real time—where it happens, how it happens, and what tools employees need to stay productive,"" Guayente Sanmartin, Senior Vice President and Division President of Commercial Systems & Displays Solutions at HP Inc., said in a statement. ""HP's focus is to remove the friction and complexity that slows people down and turn emerging AI into a real advantage.""

Enterprise demand drives form factor innovation

The announcement comes as enterprises grapple with evolving workplace dynamics that require computing infrastructure to support both traditional desk-based work and more mobile, collaborative scenarios. HP cited findings from its 2025 Work Relationship Index showing that only 44 percent of workers believe their technology fits their working style, the company said.

The EliteBoard G1a represents HP's response to this challenge by collapsing the desktop form factor into something that can move between home offices, corporate workspaces, and shared collaboration areas without sacrificing performance. The device includes dual microphones and speakers integrated into the keyboard housing, eliminating the need for separate peripherals in many scenarios.

From a specifications standpoint, the EliteBoard G1a delivers what HP characterized as desktop-level AI performance through its AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processor, which provides over 50 TOPS of neural processing capability for local AI workloads. This positions the device to handle Copilot+ PC workloads including real-time transcription, translation, and AI-assisted content generation without relying on cloud connectivity, according to the company.

Security and manageability for IT organizations

For IT decision-makers, HP emphasized the device's security architecture, which includes HP Wolf Security for Business with hardware-enforced protection against firmware attacks. The company noted that the security framework has been designed to defend against emerging quantum computing threats, a consideration that is becoming increasingly relevant for enterprise security planning.

The EliteBoard also features a physical security tether and lockable cable option, addressing concerns about securing highly portable computing assets in shared or public work environments. HP characterized the device as an EPEAT 2.0 Gold Registered Product, which may factor into purchasing decisions for organizations with sustainability mandates.

The device incorporates HP Smart Sense and AMD's Auto State Management technology to dynamically adjust performance, cooling, and battery optimization based on workload and environment, the company said. An optional built-in battery configuration extends the device's utility for scenarios where desk-based power connectivity is inconsistent or unavailable.

Premium display technology complements new form factor

Alongside the EliteBoard announcement, HP introduced the Series 7 Pro 4K Monitor featuring what the company described as the world's first Neo:LED desktop display technology. The 31.5-inch monitor delivers IPS black panel performance with a 2,700:1 contrast ratio—double that of traditional IPS displays—and includes factory color calibration for professional creative workflows, according to HP.

The monitor provides 140W power delivery through Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, enabling single-cable solutions for the EliteBoard and other compatible devices. HP emphasized the monitor's 40Gbps data throughput capability as a key feature for professionals working with large files or multiple high-resolution displays.

Market positioning and availability

The EliteBoard G1a and Series 7 Pro 4K Monitor are expected to be available through HP.com beginning in March 2026, the company said. HP did not disclose pricing information in the announcement but indicated that pricing details would be provided closer to the availability date.

The EliteBoard G1a received recognition as a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree prior to its formal unveiling at the trade show. HP positioned the device as part of its broader strategy to reimagine workplace computing for hybrid and distributed work environments, emphasizing flexibility and AI-powered productivity as key differentiators.

The announcement reflects broader industry trends toward more flexible computing form factors as enterprises seek to equip knowledge workers with tools that support multiple working styles and locations. Whether the keyboard-PC form factor gains traction in enterprise environments will likely depend on IT organizations' willingness to support a departure from traditional desktop and laptop paradigms, particularly regarding asset management, security policies, and user support considerations.",https://www.varindia.com/storage/news/2026/01/WkPkS4Zf1VWI0I48ODJFFftYqgfBmQxx3hovvELz.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 04:00:38.905948

British banking behemoth Barclays PLC (NYSE:BCS) has ventured into the stablecoin settlement space with its first-of-a-kind investment in Ubyx, according to a report published Wednesday.

Barclays’ Entry Into Stablecoin Industry?

Barclays bought a stake in Ubyx as part of its plans to explore “new forms of digital money,” Reuters reported.

“As the landscape of tokens, blockchains and wallets evolves, specialist technology will play a pivotal role in delivering connectivity and infrastructure to enable regulated financial institutions to interact seamlessly,” Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays, told Benzinga.

The banking giant said it will collaborate with Ubyx to develop “tokenised money within the regulatory perimeter.”

The exact details of the investment and the valuation were not disclosed.

Ubyx, founded in 2025, is a clearing system that lets anyone deposit stablecoins, from various issuers and currencies, into regular bank or fintech accounts and redeem them. The company’s corporate office is in New York, according to private market financial platform Pitchbook.

Barclays’ Bet On Crypto

This is not Barclays’ first foray into the world of digital currencies. Back in 2015, it became the first major UK bank to accept Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) .

The bank has praised blockchain, the ledger-like technology that powers Bitcoin, as an innovative system that may significantly benefit traditional banking.

Price Action: Barclays shares rose 0.95% in after-hours trading after closing 0.27% lower at $26.25 during Tuesday's regular trading session, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The stock has nearly doubled in value over the past year.

The “everything bubble” gathered steam as almost every asset price went up, similar to 2023 and 2024. Interestingly, bitcoin was the only major asset that fell last year.

Gold was the standout performer in 2025, up 64% in US dollar terms. The sharp fall in the US currency helped its cause, as did growing concerns about the US budget deficit and easy money. It’s capped what’s been a stellar decade for the yellow metal.

The performance of international stocks also stood out. At this time last year, the biggest mantra in markets was US exceptionalism and seemingly every investor was board. That didn’t pan out as planned with the S&P 500 return of 18% trailing the world index’s 22%, emerging markets’ 33% and Europe’s 35%.

Bonds have been much maligned, though bounced back last year. That led to solid performance for 60/40 stock-bond portfolios.

As seen in the first chart, it’s the third year in a row that 95% of major asset classes have delivered positive annual returns.

Bitcoin was the only asset to finish in the red this year. Its extreme volatility during the April dip quietened talk of it being a ‘safe haven’ or ‘digital gold’.

Stocks: Europe and Asia fly, Australia lags

Breaking down stocks by country, South Korea was the best performing major market, rising 95% in US dollar terms in 2025. The likes of Spain and Greece weren’t far behind.

Overall, the Eurozone was the standout, but Asia also did well. Major Asian markets such Singapore and Japan were up 31% and 26% respectively. Even China, deemed ‘un-investible’ by many at the beginning of last year, bounced 31% to trounce both the World Index and US stocks.

In terms of which styles of stock investments worked best, there was a marked difference between the US and the rest of the world. Outside of America, value stocks beat growth. In the US, it was the opposite.

Source: Alliance Bernstein

In the US, it’s hard to believe but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down 19% and 24% respectively for the year through to lows in April. That’s before both came roaring back by year end. Amazingly, the Nasdaq gained 52% from the lows.

What were the key drivers in the US? Company earnings came in better than expected, rising 13% for the year. The rest of the gains came from valuation multiple expansion.

The S&P 500’s trailing price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 26x is well above the historical average of 19.8x. The current multiple was last seen in 2020-2021 before the correction of 2022, and in 1998-2001, when a bear market then followed.

The ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks were frequently quoted in 2025, though their performance didn’t live up to the hype. It was really the Magnificent 2 as only Alphabet and Nvidia outperformed the index.

Alphabet rocketed as the market realised that the extent of its AI capabilities, dampening fears that AI would take out its cash cow, the search business. Meanwhile, Nvidia continued its ascent as demand for its chips showed few signs of slowing down.

Tesla did ok considering its auto volumes continued to shrink as Chinese competitors gained share in electric vehicles.

Valuations for these Magnificent 7 stocks still look punchy.

Despite the mixed performance of the Magnificent 7, technology was still the best performing sector in the US. Notable sector laggards included real estate and consumer facing sectors.

In Australia, stocks underperformed the rest of the world. The ASX 200 rose 7% in 2025, 10% including dividends. That 10% looks poor compared to the returns of other markets, though it’s still in line with the long-term returns from the ASX index.

Delving deeper, it was mid and small caps that thrashed larger stocks, up 18% and 26% respectively. A lot of that outperformance was due to the continued rise in gold equities, and the comeback of lithium plays.

Across the board, materials were the big winner in 2025, while tech and healthcare were the big losers.

Source: S&P Global

Unlike in the US, growth and momentum stocks performed poorly in Australia. Interestingly, quality stocks also trailed the pack.

Source: S&P Global

Quality businesses like CSL, Goodman, REA and CAR Group didn’t live up to expectations. In the case of CSL, that was self-indicted, and in the other cases, it was likely excessive valuations coming back to earth (somewhat).

Commodities: up, up and away

Australian resource stocks were helped by the surge in many commodity prices. In 2025, silver even outdid gold, rising an astonishing 147%. Copper also did well as investors fingered it as a key AI and data centre beneficiary.

On the flip side, oil prices went south as a supply surge overwhelmed tepid demand, leaving large excess inventories.

With the notable exception of beef, agricultural commodities also underperformed.

King dollar no more?

The rise of the US dollar took an abrupt about-turn in 2025. The USD finished the year down 10% on a trade-weighted basis.

Source: Bofa

The Aussie dollar started the year near 62 cents to the US dollar and finished above 67 cents. That was driven by changing expectations for interest rates and inflation. The market now forecasts rate rises in Australia this year. Conversely, in the US, consensus suggests rate falls, especially with a new Trump-friendly Federal Reserve Chairman replacing Jerome Powell by mid this year. Given the differing paths for rates, it wouldn’t surprise to see a further rise in the Aussie versus the USD.

2026 outlook

At this time last year, I suggested that investors should seek to diversify their stock holdings beyond the US and Australia. The primary reason being that other major markets like Europe and Asia were considerably cheaper. That suggestion paid off, not that many Australian-based investors listened as they continued to pile into American markets. I see no little reason why the outperformance of non-US stock markets can’t continue.

American equities have had a remarkable 16 year bull market, with stocks up close to 16% per annum (p.a.), well above their historical 10% p.a. returns. The average US market has lasted around 18 years, which would indicate that we may be in the last leg of this bull market. Most importantly, every valuation metric for US stocks is near or at record highs. Whenever the Shiller PE and trailing PE for America have been at current levels, it’s resulted in flat to low single digit returns on every single occasion throughout history.

In other words, if you’re betting on the US stock market, you really do think this time is different, and that spectacular recent performance can continue. I’m on the other side of that bet.

Where does that leave the ASX? If commodities continue to their ascent, there is a good chance that Australia outperforms the US this year (yes, you read that right). And given my expectations for low single digit returns from US equities over the next decade, I believe the odds favour ASX stocks handily beating their American counterparts over that period.

Drilling down on the ASX, I wrote at the start of last year that a rotation out of miners into banks could happen soon and resource outperformance may then persist for many years to come. That rotation happened in 2025, and I think there’s a high probability for it to continue. The reason being that the banks remain steeply priced and many miners have lagged the rise in commodity prices.

What about bonds and cash? It’s hard to be bullish. Major countries around the world have enormous debt loads and higher inflation is the easiest way to bring these debt levels down to more reasonable levels. And in Australia, interest rates are on the way up, not down.

On the flip side, investor positioning and flows show bonds remain the most hated of the major asset classes. It wouldn’t take much for this to change.

Overall, you’re likely to see pedestrian returns from bonds for 2026 and beyond.

For 60/40 portfolios, that’s not a bad thing, as it should deliver solid overall returns.

In this week's edition...

Just before Christmas, the federal government released revised draft legislation for its $3 million super tax. Over the holidays, Meg Heffron has had a thorough look through it and says while it's better than the original legislation, there are some stings in the tail.

Tim Farrelly has been around markets for a long time and each year he provides his 10 fearless forecasts for the 12 months ahead. His 2026 predictions include US government bonds will beat gold, US market performance will be underwhelming, and dividends will outstrip growth as a source of Australian equity returns.

The media talks endlessly about our ever rising population, but little is said about the infrastructure that will be needed to cater to more people. Ross Elliot has written a great piece breaking down how many hospitals, schools, and so, that we'll need in future. The numbers are eye opening.

Is the world's safest currency - the US dollar - actually the riskiest? Orbis' Nicholas Purser says it may be, and outlines the case why.

Dementia has become Australia's biggest killer and I've documented my family's recent battles with it. Ashley Owen went through it with his mother and he details his extensive experience with aged care homes and what he learned along the way. Separately, Ashley himself has recently developed cancer and Firstlinks wishes him and his family well.

China has flooded the world with electric cars and solar panels to offset the economic drag from a weak domestic property market. How long can this go on, and what are the implications for commodities and Australia? Greg Canavan gives his take.

Elon Musk’s trillion-dollar Tesla pay deal looks like excess, but its structure may be one of the strongest examples of alignment between a CEO and shareholders. Strip away the outrage and Lawrence Lam thinks it becomes a blueprint for how long-term, high-risk incentives can drive founder-style ambition rather than reward inertia. And, ASX companies should take note.

Lastly, in this week's whitepaper, Vanguard sees upside to economic growth but risks for stock markets in 2026.

Simply Wall St has no position in any stocks mentioned.","What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on how the market views a company’s growth prospects and risk. Higher expected earnings growth or lower perceived risk can justify a higher multiple, while lower growth or higher uncertainty usually points to a lower one.

Boston Scientific currently trades on a P/E of 52.40x. That sits above both the Medical Equipment industry average of 30.65x and the peer group average of 41.73x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio for Boston Scientific is 41.28x, which is its estimate of what a more appropriate P/E might be once you factor in elements like earnings growth, industry, profit margins, market cap and specific risks.

This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for the company’s own characteristics rather than assuming one size fits all. On this basis, Boston Scientific’s current P/E looks higher than its Fair Ratio, which points to an expensive reading on this metric.

As of September 2025, U.S. manufacturing payrolls totaled 12.7 million workers, down from 17.2 million in 2000, even as productivity has risen sharply.","Ralph Lauren and the Council of Fashion Designers of America is widening its financial commitment to domestic apparel production as new economic data underscore just how fragile American fashion manufacturing has become.

This week, the CFDA announced two new grant programs aimed at stabilizing and modernizing U.S.-based fashion manufacturing, extending its support well beyond New York City for the first time. The move comes as fresh analysis from Deloitte shows that apparel and textile manufacturing remain among the fastest-declining segments of the U.S. industrial economy, even as policymakers push to reshore production.

The first initiative, the CFDA x NY Forward Grant Fund, is a city-focused effort developed with funding from the New York State Department of State and Ralph Lauren Corp. It will provide partially matching grants to designers and manufacturers operating in New York City’s Garment District, an area that has steadily lost factories and skilled labor over the past two decades.

The second program, the U.S. Fashion Manufacturing Fund, represents a broader national expansion. Also created with Ralph Lauren as a founding partner, the new fund will operate from 2027 through 2029 and support manufacturers across key apparel-producing regions including California, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and Florida. The program is structured to cover 80 percent of eligible investments, with recipients contributing the remaining 20 percent, and is designed to help manufacturers upgrade machinery, adopt advanced software, and invest in workforce training.

Rather than attempting to recreate the labor-intensive apparel sector that once defined American manufacturing, the CFDA is directing capital toward higher-value, technology-enabled production that can survive within a dramatically changed global economy.

“Strengthening American manufacturing to ensure designers have local partners has long been at the core of CFDA’s mission,” Steven Kolb, chief executive officer and president of the CFDA, said in a statement. “We are proud to extend our decade-plus work with Ralph Lauren Corp. and expand to a national level while also continuing our local NYC investments alongside our first-ever partnership with the New York State Department of State.”

Ralph Lauren Corp. has been a central financial backer of the CFDA’s manufacturing efforts since 2013, when the organization launched its Fashion Manufacturing Initiative in partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corp. and industry executive Andrew Rosen. To date, Ralph Lauren has contributed $2 million as the initiative’s premier underwriter, enabling grants to 54 factories and supporting more than 2,000 jobs.

“Our expanded partnership with the CFDA reflects Ralph Lauren’s enduring commitment to advancing innovation and supporting American fashion,” said Katie Ioanilli, chief global impact and communications officer at Ralph Lauren Corp. “This is not only an investment in our industry — it’s an investment in a vital part of American culture that we share with the world.”

The renewed focus on modernization and training arrives as long-term economic trends continue to weigh heavily on apparel production. According to Deloitte’s Economics Insider series, real gross value added in U.S. manufacturing has grown at an average annual rate of 1.5 percent since 2000, compared with 2.1 percent growth across the broader economy. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. economic output stood at 9.4 percent in the second quarter of 2025, down from 15.1 percent 25 years earlier.

Within that contraction, apparel and textiles have been hit particularly hard. Deloitte data show that output in textile mills and textile product manufacturing has declined by an average of 2.9 percent per year since 2000, while apparel, leather, and allied products have fallen by an average of 2.2 percent annually. Employment losses have been even steeper, with apparel payrolls shrinking at an average rate of 6.8 percent per year over the same period.

By contrast, capital-intensive manufacturing sectors such as computer and electronic products have posted strong output growth, reinforcing a reality that CFDA leaders appear to be acknowledging: future domestic fashion manufacturing will depend less on scale and more on specialization, automation, and advanced skills.

The structure of the new grant programs mirrors that shift. Both funds are explicitly designed to help companies modernize equipment, expand technical services, and train workers in advanced production methods rather than increase headcount alone. The CFDA x NY Forward Grant Fund will distribute two rounds of funding in 2026 and 2027, with one manufacturer in each round also receiving the Ralph Lauren Manufacturing Award, which covers the full grant amount in recognition of innovation.

New York State remains a focal point. In 2024, the state’s fashion industry was responsible for approximately $25 billion in wages, with New York City accounting for roughly $20 billion annually. Statewide, fashion employs about 315,000 people, including 204,000 jobs based in the city.

Ralph Lauren has also continued to anchor portions of its own production domestically, particularly through its role as Official Outfitter of Team USA. The company manufactures parade ceremony uniforms in the United States, including the opening and closing ceremony looks for the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games, work that has supported multiple American factories.

When asked about the potential for expanding U.S. production further, the company said, “We continue to explore and build additional opportunities to manufacture our products in the U.S. We value the wide range of production solutions that U.S. manufacturers can offer, from heritage craftsmanship to high-tech manufacturing like 3D printing. However, increasing domestic manufacturing is a complex process that requires ongoing collaboration across our sector, from how we collectively source raw materials to increasing existing domestic factory capacity to talent availability.”

The company added, “Working with factories across the country, we produce hundreds of thousands of products across all of our brands in the U.S.”

Deloitte’s analysis suggests that this kind of selective, high-value domestic production is likely to define the sector’s future. While tariffs and trade policy have renewed political interest in reshoring, the firm notes that manufacturing growth now hinges more on skilled labor, automation, and productivity than on sheer employment. As of September 2025, U.S. manufacturing payrolls totaled 12.7 million workers, down from 17.2 million in 2000, even as productivity has risen sharply.",https://wordpress-1228073-4378900.cloudwaysapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ethos-logo-295x295.png,N,,2026-01-08 00:02:35.340468

The Philips Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush also features a ""2 + 1"" dual-effect professional mode.
In the new year, Philips will continue to use professional health technology to lay a foundation for the oral health of the public.","Every morning and evening, we may have completed a ""task-based toothbrushing"" - brushing for a full 2 minutes, but not necessarily reaching every corner. Have you ever thought that due to problems such as uneven pressure and missed areas, even with the most careful brushing, the cleaning effect may be greatly reduced? As the main culprit of oral health problems, the hidden accumulation of dental plaque not only tends to cause issues after the frequent delicious food gatherings during the New Year, but also poses a long-term potential threat to overall health. A truly efficient cleaning requires not only daily persistence but also the correct method. Especially during the New Year when the diet is diverse and social activities are frequent, it is not only a guarantee for maintaining current confidence but also a long-term health investment for yourself, your relatives, friends, and loved ones.

On the occasion of the New Year, based on a profound understanding of the pain points in daily oral care, Philips, the No.1 sonic electric toothbrush recommended by dentists globally, has once again upgraded its professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology and officially launched an epoch-making new product - the Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush. It not only provides powerful cleaning power but also introduces the concept of ""smart navigation"" into oral care, aiming to end the era of ""blind brushing"" and enable everyone to easily master professional-level cleaning methods.

Smarter! The new 360° smart voice navigation function, with record-level bone conduction acoustic technology, provides clear and detailed voice prompts and toothbrushing feedback. You can even clean your teeth with your eyes closed and easily achieve cleanliness, protection, and beauty in your oral cavity.

More efficient! With Philips' 33 years of professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology and the three-in-one technology, the kinetic energy is efficiently transmitted in succession, allowing you to clean 40% more hard-to-reach areas in 2 minutes.

By purchasing it from the Philips Professional Oral Care Flagship Store on Tmall, you will have a chance to receive a Golden Horse gift bag + a set of New Year cards featuring Xiao Zhan, adding both health blessings and a sense of quality. Starting from January 12th, it will be launched on platforms such as Douyin and JD.com successively. Search for ""Philips Navigation Toothbrush"" to unlock a new experience in New Year health care for you and your family.

Philips electric toothbrushes are centered around 33 years of professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology. Through the efficient relay transmission of kinetic energy by the ""brush bristles - brush head - motor"" three-in-one system, they drive micro-bubble water flow to clean about 40% more hard-to-reach areas such as tooth gaps. The newly launched Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush, on the basis of its professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology, deeply integrates a 360° smart voice navigation system and is equipped with record-level bone conduction acoustic technology. During navigation, the sound is three-dimensional and clear, and the instructions are clear and easy to understand. It provides comprehensive guidance and error correction at every stage before, during, and after toothbrushing. Combined with the real-time sensitive induction of Soni-sense sensor technology, it can precisely detect and instantly remind users of inappropriate toothbrushing behaviors such as toothbrushing pressure, toothbrushing time, toothbrushing speed, as well as overpressure, horizontal brushing, and missed areas without interrupting the toothbrushing process and can provide real-time guidance. Users don't need to study the complex Bass toothbrushing method. By following the voice navigation, they can effectively remove dental plaque five times more effectively. Whether it's young people who pursue intelligence and efficiency or the elderly who value simplicity of operation, they can easily master it. Long-term use will help form correct oral cleaning habits.

The Philips Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush also features a ""2 + 1"" dual-effect professional mode. The first 2 minutes are for efficient oral cleaning, and the last 1 minute allows you to choose either whitening polishing or gum protection massage according to your needs, flexibly meeting diverse oral care requirements. It has a long battery life, so you can take it with you during your travels and say goodbye to battery anxiety.

The grand launch of this new product marks the iterative upgrade and innovative breakthrough of Philips' professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology. Currently, there are a wide variety of smart toothbrushes on the market. Although some products have voice prompt functions, most of them still remain at the level of simple function stacking. The birth of the Philips Diamond Smart Navigation Toothbrush stems from a deep exploration of the essence of ""effective cleaning"" - true intelligence should not just be superficial notification but rather systematically solving the fundamental pain points of ""incomplete cleaning and incorrect brushing"" and establishing long-term correct oral cleaning habits. The smart navigation toothbrush is Philips' first globally product that deeply integrates 33 years of professional sonic tooth-cleaning technology, Soni-sense sensor technology, and a 360° closed-loop navigation system, achieving an upgrade from a single ""cleaning tool"" to a systematic ""long-term dental steward"".

In the new year, Philips will continue to use professional health technology to lay a foundation for the oral health of the public. It is not only responsible for every current cleaning but also cares about and protects the long-term health of the public. A smart navigation toothbrush that provides long-term, scientific, and systematic guidance is becoming a more forward-looking health gift choice for the New Year, helping consumers improve their quality of health in the new year.","https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260107/v2_881bfc4881244262a3d4e73cd612b782@6288861_oswg112959oswg1053oswg495_img_jpg?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,w_600,h_400,limit_0/crop,w_600,h_400,g_center",N,,2026-01-08 00:02:24.980568

“Part of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,” Gonzalez Rogers said.
A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.
One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred.
Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred.","A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.

Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.

“This case is going to trial,” Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.

The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.

But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk — the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion — against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.

“Part of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,” Gonzalez Rogers said.

It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.

The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.

Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.

At that point, Musk began to suspect that Altman and another OpenAI executive, Greg Brockman, might be plotting to transform the research lab into a profit-seeking company, according to evidence submitted to the the judge.

Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.

A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.

In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, “We’ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,” according to court filings.

At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.

One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.

Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/91208738-2234-45cc-ab81-c2a4c090114d/wirestory_ee5bfbc14c2be20906886a9ae1d2cb20_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-07 20:13:50.605678

It was a ray of light in an otherwise gloomy set of statistics in the latest bellwether S&P Global UK Construction Purchasing Managers’ Index which registered 40.1 in December, up from 39.4 in November but below the neutral 50.0 value for the twelfth successive month.

UK construction companies experienced another sharp downturn in business activity and incoming new work at the end of 2025.

But rates of contraction eased from the five-and- a-half year records seen in November while the improvement in business activity expectations hit the highest

level since July.

Around 37% of the survey panel predict a rise in output levels during the year ahead, compared to 20% that forecast a decline.

Tim Moore, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Total new orders decreased to a much lesser degree than in November, while business activity expectations for the year ahead rebounded to a five- month high.

“Some survey respondents attributed greater optimism to projections of rising infrastructure spending, especially in the utilities sector. There were also hopes

that lower borrowing costs and easing inflationary pressures could boost demand across the construction sector.”

Brian Smith, head of cost management at AECOM said: “As today’s figures show, things are starting to improve for contractors and January will all be about positioning themselves to gradually expand capacity and be on the front foot to win new work when it comes.

“Everything points towards a further slowdown in inflation and cuts in interest rates to match this year, which will embolden clients and developers to kickstart schemes left on the back burner.”",https://www.constructionenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2026-01-07-at-11.21.09-1200x828.png,N,,2026-01-08 01:58:04.121377

The construction equipment giant is piloting an AI assistive system in its mid-size Cat 306 CR Mini Excavator. Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using Nvidia’s Jetson Thor physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.

Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.

One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.

“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”

Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations.

The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the mining sector, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.

“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”

Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.

Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier for the company and its powerful GPUs.

During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its full-stack ecosystem for physical AI, which includes open AI models like the company’s Cosmos model family, simulation tools, and developer kits.

While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.

“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ces-caterpillar.jpg?resize=1200,900",N,,2026-01-07 19:03:23.380905

On December 30, Barclays raised its price target on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to $217 from $197 and kept an Equal Weight rating on the shares. The firm reviewed sales and prescription data through the final week of December and sees room for upside to Q4 consensus estimates. The strength is coming mainly from Darzalex, Tremfya, and Simponi. Based on that trend, Barclays lifted its estimates ahead of the earnings release.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) continues to generate strong free cash flow, even as it spends heavily on research and development. R&D investment reached $10.4 billion through the third quarter, putting the company among the largest investors in innovation globally. That cash flow also gives it flexibility on the deal side. Recently, the company closed its $3.1 billion acquisition of Halda Therapeutics, which brings a new platform aimed at advancing cancer treatment. Management expects these investments to support steady revenue and earnings growth, reinforcing the company’s ability to keep raising its dividend, which currently yields about 2.5%.

Oncology remains a core strength. Johnson & Johnson is one of the largest players in the space, with key products such as Rybrevant, an intravenous infusion, and Lazcluze, a once-daily pill. Used together, they target advanced non-small cell lung cancer with specific EGFR mutations. Inlexzo, developed for bladder cancer, is also expected to add momentum to the oncology portfolio.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and its subsidiaries focus on the research, development, manufacturing, and sale of a wide range of healthcare products across global markets.

Passengers At Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Have Faced Multiple Cancellations For Delta Air Lines Flights Cancellations for Delta Air Lines were 18 yesterday.","Delta Air Lines continues to pivot amid delays and cancellations at its major hubs worldwide. At the end of the year, Delta was forced to delay flights after ""crew duty time was exhausted"" as cancellations piled up at its biggest hub, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta.

To start the year, Delta has still been forced into making flight adjustments. That recently occurred due to the FAA restricting airspace over several Caribbean destinations. Although Delta resumed flights when the airspace closure was lifted, cancellations continued.

Now, Delta is facing yet another setback, this time at one of its major European hubs. Due to winter weather and de-icing issues, this airport has faced hundreds of cancellations over the last couple of days, including flights operated by Delta.

Here's a closer look at the latest and how Delta passengers have responded to the issues.

Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Is Cancelling At Least 700 Flights On Wednesday Due To Snow, Wind And De-Icing Issues

The nightmare experience has continued for passengers flying out of Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. One of the largest hubs in Europe, Delta Air Lines has several flights out of the international airport per day. Last year, Delta had up to 17 daily non-stop flights to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Delta generally uses the concourses E, F and G at the airport.

However, due to snow and strong winds, along with several issues de-icing aircraft, the airport has experienced widespread disruptions, to the point that more than 1,000 passengers spent the night there, forced to sleep at the international hub.

The airport has issued a statement, warning passengers that more cancellations are expected.

The airport wrote, ""On Wednesday, due to persistent winter weather and heavy winds, only limited air traffic is possible to and from Schiphol. As a precaution, more than 700 flights are cancelled. More cancellations are expected. This will be mostly European flights.""

Although the warning states mostly European flights will be affected, the same has held true for flights to the United States.

Passengers at the airport claim they've been delayed by 36 hours in extreme cases for Delta Air Lines flights.

Passengers At Amsterdam Schiphol Airport Have Faced Multiple Cancellations For Delta Air Lines Flights

Cancellations for Delta Air Lines were 18 yesterday. However, they have already increased on Wednesday.

KLM is still the airline most affected by the AMS cancellations, with 430 cancelled flights.

U.S. passengers in Amsterdam have been affected by the cancellations. One passenger saw their flight cancelled repeatedly over the last 36 hours.

They wrote online, ""So I am one of those 'un' lucky passengers stuck in Amsterdam for a better part of a week. My connecting flight to the US was cancelled on the tarmac.""

""Yesterday I got another flight for the 6th. At 11 PM that flight gets cancelled. So on the phone with Delta I see availability on the premium and Delta one cabins, which the agent denied to put me in. They give me a flight for the 7th, more then 36 hours.""

Even 36 hours later, the traveler was forced to arrive at the airport early to see if there was any space on the flight. Thankfully, there was.

The passenger added, ""After about 30 minutes I am talking to an agent and I plea for any last minute openings. She finds one right away on the direct flight, leaving in 2 hours. After 30 minutes on hold with Delta, she gets me an isle seat. WHAT? This is a delta flight!!!! So I open the Delta app and what do I see. For that flight 177 open seats, 70 in the premium cabins.

""So either the app is not correct or Delta is flying half empty planes while paying hotels and meals for stranded passengers. At the very least, Delta's systems are really messed up.""

The passenger was finally able to make it on the Delta flight after exhausting cancellations over 36 hours.

The Current Delays And Cancellation Totals

As it stands on Wednesday afternoon, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport had by far the most flight cancellations worldwide. The airport has 324 cancellations on departing flights, along with 287 for arrivals, according to FlightAware. The cancellations are higher for departing flights due to the ongoing issues of de-icing the planes.

As for Delta Air Lines, the carrier has increased cancellations from yesterday to 20. This is currently the highest among all U.S. airlines.

There are currently 124 cancelled flights within, into or out of the United States, as of Wednesday afternoon.

Why it matters: An emblem of Austin's growth — and growing pains — the city-owned airport has long been ripe for expansion.
Driving the news: City officials said they inked new lease contracts with Southwest, Delta, United, American and Alaska airlines, along with FedEx, and UPS.
The intrigue: The expansion keeps ABIA well ahead of rival San Antonio International Airport, which is also undergoing an expansion to give it up to 40 gates total.
The airport expansion is ""a tremendous economic opportunity for Austin — not only through the trades and construction jobs created during the buildout, but also through long-term jobs in concessions, airport operations, and airline services after the program is complete,"" Vanessa Fuentes, the Austin City Council member who represents the area, said in a statement.","Austin officials have firmed up the money for a massive expansion at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport — with plans to nearly double the number of gates.

Why it matters: An emblem of Austin's growth — and growing pains — the city-owned airport has long been ripe for expansion.

Catch up quick: The airport, which opened in 1999, is in the midst of an expansion that could cost upward of $6.5 billion.

The federal government has committed at least $200 million to the project so far.

The airport currently has 34 gates. Officials announced Wednesday that they'll add 32 more gates.

Driving the news: City officials said they inked new lease contracts with Southwest, Delta, United, American and Alaska airlines, along with FedEx, and UPS. The 10-year contracts will provide major revenue certainty for the airport as it embarks on the ambitious expansion project.

The contracts spell out airline fees for runways, ticket counters, gates, baggage systems and aircraft parking positions, among other things.

Airlines that are not signatories will pay per-use charges for those services.

Follow the money: City officials expect to pull in roughly $250 million in revenue from the airlines this fiscal year — more than half of its total revenue — and $275 million next fiscal year, according to a city budget document from August.

Zoom in: The money will help pay for the redevelopment of the existing Barbara Jordan Terminal, as well as:

A new pedestrian bridge connecting parking garages and the rental car facility.

A new and expanded baggage claim hall.

A new centralized TSA security checkpoint.

New expanded airline ticket counters.

And the new gates, split between two new concourses.

The intrigue: The expansion keeps ABIA well ahead of rival San Antonio International Airport, which is also undergoing an expansion to give it up to 40 gates total.

The two airports have competed for international flights and other routes in recent years.

What they're saying: The commitment from the airlines ""provides the financial foundation we need to modernize our facilities, transform customer experience, and build the infrastructure needed to support Central Texas' continued growth for generations to come,"" airport CEO Ghizlane Badawi said in a statement.

The airport expansion is ""a tremendous economic opportunity for Austin — not only through the trades and construction jobs created during the buildout, but also through long-term jobs in concessions, airport operations, and airline services after the program is complete,"" Vanessa Fuentes, the Austin City Council member who represents the area, said in a statement.

On Wednesday OpenAI, the company behind the wildly popular artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, announced that some users will be able to feed their health information into the bot, from medical records to test results to health and wellness app data.

But as Scientific American and many other outlets have previously reported, some health experts have urged caution when using ChatGPT for health care reasons—and especially for mental health. The company has faced legal scrutiny in recent years after several people, including at least two teenagers, died by suicide after interacting with ChatGPT. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Other experts are more positive. Peter D. Chang, an associate professor of radiological sciences and computer science at the University of California, Irvine, says the tool represents a “step in the right direction” toward more personalized medical care. But he also cautions that users should approach any AI-generated medical advice with a grain of salt. “Maybe don’t do exactly what it says but use it as a starting point to learn more.”

“Absolutely there’s nothing preventing the model from going off the rails to give you a nonsensical result,” Chang says.

Growth outlook strengthens as acquisition talks and partnerships advance

Eli Lilly is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire Ventyx Biosciences in a deal valued at over $1 billion, which is expected to expand its drug portfolio, especially in inflammatory disease treatments. The potential acquisition could further bolster growth prospects within the company’s pipeline. Recent news also highlights Lilly’s projected revenue gains and strategic partnerships focused on new oral therapies.

Overbought signals emerge as buyers press against resistance

Momentum remains clearly positive, with both MACD and ADX signaling bullish strength on the daily chart. RSI at 55.78 suggests bullish but not overbought conditions, though both Stochastic RSI and Bull/Bear Power flag emerging overbought zones and strong buyer dominance intraday. The Awesome Oscillator is neutral. Today’s session opened with a modest upward gap, and the price is currently near the session’s high. Intraday volatility is moderate, with a clear upward tone as buyers continue to exert pressure after the open. Some divergence is noted with oscillators reflecting mounting overbought signals even as momentum remains robust, so caution is warranted as price approaches potential exhaustion levels. Nearest support is seen at the Ichimoku Kijun ($1,036.88), with next dynamic resistance aligning near the 50-day Moving Average and the round $1,100–$1,110 zone.

Breakout risks climb as upward bias meets volatility zone

Over the next five trading days, LLY is likely to trade within a $1,075 to $1,125 volatility band relative to current levels. The probability of further upward movement is high (over 80%), while the chances of a meaningful pullback remain low. The baseline scenario sees price consolidating around $1,100, but a sustained bullish push could trigger a breakout above $1,125, whereas heightened selling might test support near $1,075. Multi-timeframe momentum continues to favor buyers, though short-term volatility risks persist as overbought readings intensify.

Previously it was reported that Eli Lilly and Company is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, consistently trading above key moving averages across all timeframes, with technical indicators such as MACD and ADX in buy territory and RSI remaining bullish without reaching overbought levels. The stock is supported near $1,035–$1,040 and faces resistance around $1,095–$1,100, while momentum and institutional activity suggest further upside is likely despite some mixed oscillator signals.",https://files.tradersunion.com/images/analytics-news/eli-lilly/eli-lilly_01.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:02:42.464565

ChatGPT Health is not intended for diagnosis and treatment, and it's not supposed to replace medical care, OpenAI said. Rather, the experience is supposed to help users navigate everyday questions, and it aims make ChatGPT's responses more relevant by grounding them in a user's own health information.

""ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,"" Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, wrote in a post on Substack.

OpenAI said ChatGPT Health has its own dedicated space within the chatbot, so all of those files, conversations and connected apps are stored separately from other chats. Information and memories from ChatGPT Health will not flow outside of that space, and those conversations will not be used to train OpenAI's foundation models, the company said.

The startup has partnered with b.well, which provides the health data connectivity infrastructure that will allow users to share their medical records with ChatGPT Health.

Users will also be able to connect to Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, the lab testing startup Function and other data. Services can be connected from tools or apps in settings.

ChatGPT Health was developed in ""close collaboration"" with physicians, OpenAI said.

OpenAI has deepened its push into health care in recent months.

After the company launched its GPT-5 model in August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC that health care was ""maybe the area where there's the strongest improvement of any category.""

In May, it released a benchmark called Health Bench that is designed to measure how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios.

The startup said Wednesday that ""hundreds of millions"" of people ask health and wellness questions each week.

ChatGPT Health will initially be made available to a small group of early users that will offer feedback and refine the experience. OpenAI said it will expand access in the coming weeks.

BALTIMORE and SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 7, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- OpenAI has selected b.well as the underlying health data connectivity infrastructure enabling users to securely connect their medical records for more personalized health AI interactions in ChatGPT Health.

Through this collaboration, users can explicitly authorize access within ChatGPT to securely connect their health data and medical records from U.S. healthcare providers. This enables health-related conversations in ChatGPT Health to be grounded in a user's own longitudinal health information, delivering more relevant, context-aware insights. The integration is designed to put consumers in charge of where and how they can safely and securely access their health information.

""One of the most common and meaningful ways people use ChatGPT today is for health and wellness information,"" said Ashley Alexander, VP of Health Products, OpenAI. ""By working with trusted brands like b.well, we're able to make the user experience even more useful and personalized.""

b.well operates a highly connected health data network designed to support consumer-mediated access to live clinical data across more than 2.2 million providers and 320 health plans, labs, and other sources. Built on FHIR-based APIs and trusted healthcare exchange frameworks, the network maintains strict controls around identity verification, consent management, data security, and auditability.

""We know patients are already using ChatGPT for health information and advice. Allowing patients to securely and privately integrate their own health data will make those interactions much more contextually relevant and accurate,"" said Kristen Valdes, CEO and Founder of b.well. ""b.well was built to make healthcare simpler for consumers and their families. We're excited that this collaboration meets consumers where they are — talking to ChatGPT — and brings more personalized interactions so they can better engage in their health and well-being.""

OpenAI is leveraging b.well's SDK for Health AI to activate this connectivity and accelerate the delivery of AI-driven health experiences.

The b.well SDK for Health AI transforms connected health data into clean, aggregated, AI-optimized inputs for large language model (LLM) applications, enabling organizations to deploy and scale AI-driven health experiences in weeks rather than months or years. The SDK supports secure use of both structured and unstructured clinical data — including patient summaries, lab and vital trends, clinical notes such as progress notes and discharge summaries, diagnostic interpretations, care plans, and coverage information — while optimizing data delivery for performance, cost efficiency, and fast response times. This approach allows AI systems to generate answers in seconds, even when working with years of longitudinal patient records.

""Today, AI is only able to work across a small part of the patient record. The b.well Health SDK for AI finally enables AI to work across the full patient record — spanning multiple EMRs and with complete access to both structured data and unstructured data,"" said Imran Qureshi, Chief AI and Technology Officer at b.well. ""We are excited about the power of combining OpenAI's industry-leading AI with b.well's industry-first AI SDK to help consumers make informed decisions about their health.""

The work with OpenAI reflects a broader industry shift toward B2B health infrastructure models — where AI and consumer platforms rely on proven interoperability networks rather than building healthcare connectivity from scratch. By leveraging b.well's existing network, OpenAI can accelerate development while aligning with U.S. healthcare data standards and privacy regulations.

This announcement builds on b.well's growing role as foundational infrastructure for technology companies integrating health data into consumer experiences, following similar work with major global technology leaders.

Uber shares have fallen about 17% since late September, leaving the valuation near last year’s lows despite what the analysts see as limited near-term competitive impact from AVs.

Jefferies wrote that the selloff echoes late 2024, when similar fears preceded a sharp rally. They added that the multiple has returned to levels that previously paved the way for an approximately 70% rally through much of 2025.

The analysts contend that AV adoption will have “nearly zero impact on growth through 2027,” as Uber’s expansion increasingly depends on markets outside San Francisco, where autonomous testing has been concentrated.

They estimate that even with Waymo’s rapid progress, the impact on Uber’s bookings growth will be negligible relative to overall demand growth.

Waymo reported about 450,000 paid rides per week in December and is targeting one million weekly rides by the end of 2026. Even at that scale, Jefferies estimates Waymo would account for roughly 1.2% of US rideshare volume, translating into headwinds of just 0.07% and 0.11% to Uber’s bookings growth in 2026 and 2027, respectively. “Which pales in comparison to overall growth in the high-teens,” the analysts wrote.

Investor attention has also shifted toward Tesla’s autonomous ambitions, which some view as a greater long-term threat due to its manufacturing capacity.

However, Jefferies argues that economics remain a constraint. “Our analysis shows that even after reaching scale in 5+ years, a standalone AV fleet would still have costs per trip that are slightly above rideshare,” the analysts wrote, citing lower utilization and the need to build capacity for peak demand.

Against that backdrop, Jefferies sees Uber as well-positioned to benefit rather than be displaced by AVs. “Over the past two years, UBER has grown its stable of AV partnerships to over 20, creating an ecosystem that reduces reliance on any single provider,” the analysts wrote.

They added that Uber’s large user base and fleet management expertise should help it integrate autonomous supply while maintaining an asset-light model.

Jefferies maintained a $120 price target on Uber, implying roughly 40% upside from current levels, and said it expects durable mobility growth and continued progress on AV partnerships to drive the shares higher despite near-term headline risk.

It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard.
Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC.
Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer.
While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC.","A keyboard computer has always been on my wishlist — that is, a computer where the entire machine was stuffed into a keyboard. Perhaps I caught a glimpse of the Commodore 64 at an impressionable age, but regardless, the idea has always been intriguing to me. At CES 2026, HP is bringing that concept back with the new EliteBoard G1a, which is dubbed a “Next Gen AI PC.”

It's an IT administrator's dream: It looks a typical desktop keyboard, but it has the full power of a Copilot+ AI PC inside. You can equip it with Ryzen 5 or 7 CPUs and their embedded Radeon 800 GPUs, up to 64GB of RAM and as much as 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. All you need to do is add a monitor and a mouse, and you've got a full-fledged desktop setup.

The more I think about it, the more sad I am that the arc of the computing industry trended towards standardized desktops and laptops. There was a brief spark of interest with the UMPC (ultra mobile PC) trend in the 2000's, which Engadget covered extensively as a young blog, as well as ASUS's Eee keyboard. But they couldn't survive the rise of the smartphone and tablet. It turns out putting an entire computer behind a screen was more compelling than stuffing them into a keyboard.

I was able to test out an early EliteBoard prototype, and while the experience wasn't perfect, it's still an intriguing computing option. I had trouble setting it up initially because it only had two USB-C ports on its rear, which meant I had to find a way to power it through one port and pass a video signal through the other. Thankfully, my Anker USB-C charging hub was able to juice it up, and I also had a USB-C hub with an HDMI port, which allowed me to connect to my monitor.

Sadly, the overall setup was a jumble of wires, and not the clean layout I expected from a keyboard PC. Once I was able to start up Windows though, I was less annoyed and more amazed that the keyboard contained an entire computer. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised, as Intel's Compute Stick placed a functional PC in a much smaller case, but unlike the failed product, the EliteBoard actually felt usable. I was able to load up several browser windows with tabs, edit a few photos and even play a few light games, like Vampire Survivors. And yes, typing on it felt pretty great too.

Since I was testing out prototype hardware, I agreed not to benchmark the EliteBoard. But from the performance I saw, it felt about the same an entry-level laptop. Basically, it's perfectly suited to its main task: Being a boring office computer. Back in my IT days, I certainly would have preferred deploying a few light keyboards instead of the tank-like Dell desktops we typically ordered.

While the EliteBoard is targeted at commercial users, HP is considering it an experiment to see how people respond to a keyboard PC. There's a chance we could see one that's eventually meant for mainstream consumers. I'm not sure if that's exactly, necessary, though. The whole concept of a desktop PC mainly appeals to tinkerers and IT folks. And for anyone who wants to get their hands on an EliteBoard soon, there's really nothing stopping you.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9FzrEqYh99.2zeZe5jHYIg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03MTk-/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/HP_EliteBoard-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:14.631138

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Press release from the issuing company:

This week at CES 2026, HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) debuted new technologies that position personal fulfilment as the next frontier for driving business growth. Knowledge workers worldwide are feeling under pressure; just 20% have a healthy relationship with work. But given the right tools and technology, the likelihood of workers having a healthy work relationship more than doubles – and increases five-fold when the workforce sees their company investing in them. In an era marked by disruption and change, HP recognizes a growing fulfilment deficit in the workforce and is committed to empowering organizations to transform this challenge into an opportunity for innovation and resilience.

HP Innovations Designed for the Future of Work

As businesses navigate unprecedented challenges, HP remains steadfast in its commitment to pioneering solutions that foster professional fulfilment and accelerate business growth, ensuring that the future of work is both human-centered and technology-driven.

New products and solutions include:

Designing for the future of work means creating solutions that move, connect, and adapt to any workspace. HP’s newest form factor, the HP EliteBoard G1a (pictured below), is the world’s first full AI PC built into a keyboard10 and a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree.

Built for leaders shaping the future of work, HP introduced its HP EliteBook X G2 Series, the next generation of premium business laptops built for the AI era and a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree.

Bringing passion-ready experiences so consumers can work smarter, look sharper, and lead better, HP unveiled new updates to the full HP OmniBook consumer portfolio – including the new HP OmniBook Ultra 14 and HP OmniStudioX.

Delivering AI-powered productivity right at the printer, HP introduced the first integration of Microsoft Copilot into HP Office Print devices with HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot, providing document summarization, translation, and smart organization to help businesses work faster, smarter, and more securely.

Keep hybrid work running smoothly and strengthen IT’s ability to maintain business continuity across distributed environments with enhancements to the company’s Workforce Experience Platform (WXP) employee device management features.

Pair your new HP PC with intuitive, ergonomic, and sustainable peripherals for every workspace, including a stylish pink version of the HP Tilt Ergonomic Mouse 720M, a new compact USB-C HP 65W GaN Wall Charger, lightweight and durable HP Protective Series laptop sleeves, and more.

When it’s time to clock out, get your game on. HP is redefining how gamers play, create, and perform, unifying its OMEN and HyperX brands under one master gaming brand – HyperX – and engineering the world’s most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling11, the HyperX OMEN MAX 16.

To understand your PC’s origin story, HP developed HP Digital Passport, a CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree, giving customers one place to access PC essentials: from getting started, discovering unique product features and their device’s sustainability story, to finding support options as their needs evolve.

Future of Work Accelerator 2026: Applications Open Soon

As part of HP’s commitment to business growth and professional fulfillment, the Future of Work Accelerator expands access to technology and skills for disconnected communities.

Cole will be CEO-Designate as of January 19, 2026, and will officially assume the CEO role on February 16, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) said in a statement on Tuesday (January 6).

Cole will succeed Andy Mooney, who led Fender as CEO since 2015 and will be retiring.

Mooney leaves Fender after more than a decade in the CEO role, leading the company through a period of technological innovation that included the launch of subscription-based digital software.

Fender launched the Fender Play app – an online learning platform for guitars and other string instruments – in 2017. In 2025, the company launched Fender Studio, an app for recording music and jamming.

Cole has been with Fender since 2015, most recently serving as President of the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, a role in which he led a number of initiatives including the launch of Fender’s APAC headquarters in Tokyo and launching the first-ever Fender flagship store in Harajuku, Tokyo, in 2023.

Fender credits Cole with expanding the company’s presence in 14 APAC markets.

“Bud has been one of the most impactful leaders within our organization. He has a deep understanding of the Fender brand, our global players, and the commercial and operational foundation required to propel us into the future,” said Mark Fukunaga, Executive Chairman of the FMIC Board.

“His track record of building teams, expanding markets, and elevating Fender’s presence around the world makes him uniquely qualified to lead the next chapter of growth. On behalf of the Board, I also want to thank Andy Mooney for his leadership over the past decade and for the significant contributions he has made to the company.”

“[Cole’s] track record of building teams, expanding markets, and elevating Fender’s presence around the world makes him uniquely qualified to lead the next chapter of growth.”

Mark Fukunaga, Fender

“Leading Fender has been a highlight of my career. I’m deeply grateful for the creativity and commitment of the Fender teams around the world and proud of what we’ve accomplished,” Mooney said in a statement.

“I’m excited to pass the baton on to Bud and confident that under his leadership, Fender will continue to inspire players for generations to come.”

Prior to joining Fender, Cole held senior leadership roles at Pernod Ricard Group, LVMH, QVC, and Ralph Lauren, building a globally focused career that has seen him work in some 60 countries.

Fender stresses that Cole is a lifelong musician whose first guitar was an acoustic Fender La Brea, followed by a Fender Made-in-Japan 1969 Thinline Telecaster reissue purchased in 1989, which Cole still plays today.

A graduate of Arizona State University, Cole’s first job interview out of college was for a PR position at Fender – a role he didn’t land. That makes his eventual appointment as CEO “especially meaningful,” Fender said.

Founded in 1946, FMIC will celebrate its 80th anniversary this year. Along with the Fender brand, the company owns and operates Squier, Gretsch guitars, Jackson, EVH, Charvel, Bigsby, and PreSonus.",https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2026/01/Edward-Bud-Cole-Fender-Musical-Instruments-Corporation-CEO-Designate-Photo-Credit_-Naoki-Tsuruta-.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:34.880022

Texas-based H-E-B placed first for the fifth time in nine years. Market Basket ranked second for the second time, while Wisconsin-based Woodman’s entered the rankings for the first time and placed third, replacing Costco in the ranking. It marks the first time the top three retailers in the index are all regional chains.

Costco ranked fourth, followed by Aldi, WinCo Foods, Trader Joe’s, Amazon, Wegmans and ShopRite, rounding out the top 10.

Walmart, which owns over 20% of the market share in the grocery industry, finished 11th, and its warehouse retailer, Sam’s Club, was 14th. Publix was 13th and Kroger was 18th.

Woodman’s rise to third place was attributed to strong performance in price, promotions and rewards, as well as quality and operations. Amazon, which ranked first in 2021 and 2022, fell two spots, while Sam’s Club dropped six places. Dunnhumby said the declines were linked in part to a reduced emphasis on digital capabilities in the 2025 rankings and weaker performance on price and quality measures.

The study found that 41% of a retailer’s long-term success is tied to customers’ perception of savings through pricing, promotions and rewards, an increase of three percentage points from last year and the highest level recorded. It remained the most influential factor among five customer perception measures used in the index.

“2025 threw a lot of curveballs at the U.S. consumer,” said Matt O’Grady of dunnhumby, citing concerns about higher prices, fewer job opportunities and stagnant wages. He said shoppers across income levels are becoming more price conscious.

The Retailer Preference Index combines financial performance with customer perception data. It evaluates 81 retailers that sell food and everyday household items. Financial data is provided by Flywheel, while customer perception data is drawn from a dunnhumby survey of more than 11,000 U.S. grocery shoppers. The five factors measured are price, promotions and rewards; quality; digital capabilities; operations; and speed and convenience.

The report found that U.S. consumers place a higher priority on saving money on groceries than consumers in other developed countries, according to a global dunnhumby analysis that referenced data from the Social Progress Imperative. Dunnhumby’s Consumer Trends Tracker showed that 56% of Americans cannot cover a $400 emergency expense, a figure that has worsened since December 2024. The study also estimated that 58 million Americans experience food insecurity and occasionally skip meals because of affordability concerns.

The analysis noted a narrowing gap between price-focused retailers and traditional grocers on perceptions of quality, particularly among chains such as Walmart and Aldi. As a result, quality has become a more prominent competitive factor alongside price.

Retailers in the top quarter of the rankings outperformed competitors in grocery revenue growth over the past year and the past five years and gained long-term market share, according to the report.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt58a1f8f560a1ab0e/bltf8f74c7051c741b9/695ead361ea87d090e625ebf/The_newest_H-E-B_store_in_the_Dallas_market_in_Prosper_Texas.webp?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-07 21:00:28.147109

Impact of Marketing Investments on 2025 Holiday Season

Sales generated through consumers visiting a retail site from social media increased 40.3% year over year, with social media generating 4.6% of holiday revenue, up from 3.3% of revenue in 2024. This is separate from social media influencers, which generated one in five online holiday purchases (20.4% of sales from affiliates and partners) up from 17.6% share of revenue from the 2024 holiday season. Paid search and email also drove a significant share of revenue, according to Adobe without providing specific figures.

Generative artificial intelligence chat services, like ChatGPT, also increased its share of referring sales, according to Adobe data. Consumers especially used these tools to find deals and research products. Traffic to U.S. retail sites from generative AI increased 670% year over year. Adobe did not reveal the percent of traffic that comes from generative AI.

“While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value AI can deliver as a shopping assistant,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a press release. “These services were used most in categories including video games, toys, appliances, electronics and personal care products.”

Discounts

Retailers’ strong discounts drove the considerable increase in online sales this holiday season, according to Adobe. In many categories, the average peak discount rate was higher than in 2024:

Electronics — 30.9% off listed price compared with 30.1% in 2024

Toys — 29.6% peak discount (vs. 28%)

Apparel — 25.1% peak discount (vs. 23.2%)

Televisions — 24.3% peak discount (vs. 24.2%)

Computers — 23.4% peak discount (vs. 22.8%)

Sporting goods — 20.3% peak discount (vs. 19.5%)

Appliances — 20.2% peak discount (vs. 19.2%)

Furniture — 18.8% peak discount (vs. 19%)

Deep discounts also enticed shoppers to purchase higher-ticket items and many shoppers “traded up,” according to Adobe.

Barclays cited the growing interest in cryptocurrencies as part of the reason for its strategic investment. The U.S. banking giant also highlighted progress in regulatory processes in several jurisdictions, adoption, and emerging use cases, adding that both companies will remain committed to the responsible development of tokenized money within the regulatory perimeter.

Stablecoins in particular are increasingly becoming a popular segment of the industry after President Trump signed into law the much-awaited GENIUS Act last July. The bill provides clarity for regulating cryptocurrencies tied to real-world assets.

Commenting on the announcement, Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets and Strategic Investments at Barclays, said: “Interoperability is essential to unlock the full potential of digital assets. As the landscape of tokens, blockchains, and wallets evolves, specialist technology will play a pivotal role in delivering connectivity and infrastructure to enable regulated financial institutions to interact seamlessly.”

Tony McLaughlin, CEO of Ubyx, commented: “Our mission is to build a common globalised acceptance network for regulated digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins. Bank participation is vital to provide par value redemption through regulated channels. We are entering a world in which every regulated firm offers digital wallets in addition to traditional bank accounts.”

This company, which is in the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.

This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10.01%.

For the last reported quarter, The Bank of New York Mellon came out with earnings of $1.91 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.76 per share, representing a surprise of 8.52%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $1.74 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.94 per share, delivering a surprise of 11.49%.

Price and EPS Surprise

For The Bank of New York Mellon, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.

Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

The Bank of New York Mellon has an Earnings ESP of +3.13% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on January 13, 2026.

When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.

Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.

Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

The Vera Rubin platform is not a single chip. Instead, it is a full system made of six chips that work together as one AI computer. Nvidia stated that the platform is already in full production, with shipments planned for the second half of 2026.

For now, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told analysts that Nvidia’s prior estimate of $500 billion in data center chip revenue through year-end has increased. She said customer demand has come in higher than expected across both current and future products.

Meanwhile, NVDA shares closed Tuesday at $187.24, showing little change on the day despite the announcements.

Performance Gains and Revenue Outlook

At the center of the platform is the Rubin graphics chip, which includes 288 gigabytes of HBM4 memory. This allows data to move much faster than in Nvidia’s current Blackwell system. Nvidia said the new setup offers close to three times the memory speed per chip.

In addition, the full rack system uses 72 Rubin chips along with Vera CPUs and other Nvidia hardware. As a result, Nvidia says the system can deliver up to five times more performance for AI tasks that run after models are trained.

Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said demand for both training and everyday AI use continues to rise. As a result, Wall Street now expects Nvidia to generate about $321.2 billion in revenue in calendar 2026, which would be about 57% growth from the prior year.

China Demand and Global Expansion

Separately, Huang said demand from China for Nvidia’s H200 chips remains very strong. He confirmed that production is active after the U.S. government signaled support for exports under a revenue-sharing plan. He added that final approval would be clear once orders are placed.

At the same time, Nvidia plans to expand its workforce in Israel. The company aims to double its staff there to ten thousand workers and build a new campus in Kiryat Tivon. This move reflects Nvidia’s long-term investment plans as AI demand continues to grow.

Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $263.39, implying a 40.67% upside from the current price.

Albertsons saw net sales and other revenue increase by just under 2% during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, to about $19.1 billion, driven primarily by strong growth in pharmacy sales, the supermarket operator announced Wednesday.

Identical sales were up by 2.4%, an amount that was depressed by between 10 and 20 basis points by the delay in the distribution of SNAP benefits caused by the federal government shutdown last autumn.

Shoppers showed growing signs of price sensitivity during the quarter, with even higher-income shoppers paying more attention to costs, CEO Susan Morris said during a Wednesday morning earnings call.

Dive Insight:

The shaky economic conditions that defined Albertsons’ latest quarter affected shopping behavior across the income spectrum, with customers who earn less buying fewer items per trip, prioritizing essentials and making more frequent visits to stores, Morris said. Middle-income households, which Morris said had been “relatively resilient,” traded down in some categories as their spending capacity took a hit, while spending patterns among more affluent customers remained stable even as these shoppers became more conscious of price and value, she said.

In response, Albertsons stepped up personalized promotions and loyalty program enhancements during Q3 while also turning to “surgical management of cost inflation,” Morris said. The retailer continued to invest in its private label portfolio and is on course to increase its own brands penetration from 25% to 30%, she said.

“We also very carefully manage the pass through inflation to deliver value for customers across the entire company, ensuring affordability while protecting margins,” Morris said. The grocer leaned into artificial intelligence systems as it sought to deliver relief to shoppers while also charting its future course, she added.

Albertsons is also looking to digital relationships with shoppers to drive sales, Morris said, noting that the “Ask AI” search tool the company introduced in 2025 drove a 10% increase in basket size among people who use the capability.

“By leveraging AI, we’re creating differentiated experiences that go beyond convenience. They increase basket size, drive repeat trips and deepen loyalty,” Morris said.

Albertsons’ online sales rose 21% during Q3, while digital penetration reached about 9.5%, she said. Albertsons believes that its e-commerce business could become profitable as soon as the end of this year, President and CFO Sharon McCollam said during the call, adding that the company does not include retail media sales when calculating its digital profitability.

McCollam said Albertsons expects to face significant headwinds during the coming months stemming from Medicare drug price reductions related to the federal Inflation Reduction Act, the first round of which went into effect at the start of 2026. The company forecasts that the changes will depress identical sales during Q4 by about two-thirds of a percentage point and shave as many as 18 basis points off that metric for the full fiscal year, she said.

Here’s My Take Jensen Huang’s CES keynote wasn’t just about showing off new hardware.
Huang’s CES keynote made it clear that Nvidia isn’t waiting for this future to arrive.","Greetings from “the most powerful tech event in the world!”

I’m writing to you from Las Vegas, where I’m attending CES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show. This is the massive annual trade show that showcases the next generation of technology.

And I’ve already seen some wild things. Including this guy here…

Who I’ll save for a future issue.

But today, I want to cover Jensen Huang’s keynote, just like I did last year.

I wasn’t able to watch it live because I was attending the Boston Scientific and Hyundai keynote, although I’ll have a chance to see Huang speak at the Sphere later this week.

Still, I watched every minute of his CES keynote as soon as I got back to my hotel room.

And I don’t think it’s something we can afford to gloss over.

Because what he delivered was more than just a product showcase. It was Jensen Huang telling us where artificial intelligence is headed next…

And which companies are positioning themselves to control it.

From Cloud AI to Physical AI

For most of the last two years, artificial intelligence has been based almost entirely in the cloud.

We’ve measured progress by model size, training runs and how many tokens a system can generate per second.

That phase created enormous value. It also made Nvidia one of the most important companies in the world.

But Jensen Huang made something clear at CES this week.

That phase is ending.

The next phase of AI is not about generating words or images. It is about systems that can perceive the physical world, reason about it and take action on it. And Nvidia intends to supply the computing platform that makes this possible.

That’s why Huang spent so much time talking about physical AI in his keynote.

And it’s not just talk. During the keynote, he introduced Nvidia’s next major computing platform, Vera Rubin, which will enter production later this year.

Vera Rubin is a full-system architecture that combines Nvidia’s custom CPU, next-generation GPUs, high-bandwidth memory, networking and data processing units into a single rack-scale machine.

In layman’s terms, it represents a shift from AI as software to AI as an operating system for physical machines.

According to Nvidia, a full Vera Rubin NVL72 system can deliver more than 3 exaFLOPS of inference performance. That’s more than double what the previous generation delivered.

More important than that raw number is what it enables. These systems are designed to run massive AI workloads continuously, with lower training costs and far higher throughput than before.

And that’s a huge deal because physical AI is compute-hungry in a way that cloud-only AI isn’t.

Training a language model is expensive. But training a system to drive a car, operate a robot or control industrial equipment is far more demanding.

These systems must process sensor data in real-time and simulate thousands of possible outcomes before acting. And they must do it reliably, not once, but every second of every day.

Nvidia is aligning its entire platform around making that possible.

Huang also unveiled Alpamayo, a new reasoning-focused AI stack designed for autonomous vehicles.

The key problem for driverless vehicles is that seeing the world isn’t enough. Autonomous systems tend to fail in unusual situations outside their training data.

Nvidia is trying to solve that by pairing perception with reasoning, so vehicles can think through a situation before acting.

Mercedes-Benz plans to ship vehicles using this system in early 2026.

Nvidia paired that announcement with demonstrations of its simulation software, which allows companies to generate vast amounts of synthetic training data. With it, robots, vehicles and industrial systems can be trained in virtual environments before they ever touch the real world.

Nvidia says these tools are already being used by robotics companies and manufacturers to accelerate development and reduce costs.

Taken together, Huang’s message from CES shows that — once again — he’s seemingly pivoting at exactly the right moment.

Nvidia is aiming to become the operating system for intelligent machines.

And the company can afford to make that bet because its current business is throwing off an extraordinary amount of cash.

In its most recent reported quarter, Nvidia generated roughly $57 billion in revenue, with data center sales dominating growth. Those numbers were driven by cloud providers racing to build AI infrastructure.

But cloud demand alone doesn’t justify the scale of investment Nvidia is making now.

Physical AI does.

Autonomous vehicles, industrial robots, logistics systems and intelligent factories represent a much larger and longer-lasting market than chatbots. These systems will require continuous upgrades, ongoing training and massive compute budgets.

And that changes the economics. It also helps explain Nvidia’s competitive position.

Because building a fast chip is difficult. Building an integrated platform that spans hardware, networking, software, simulation and developer tools is even harder.

But once companies commit to that full stack, switching becomes costly.

That’s the payoff Nvidia is banking on.

Here’s My Take

Jensen Huang’s CES keynote wasn’t just about showing off new hardware.

It was about drawing a line between the AI era we’re living through now and the one that comes next.

This current one is all about models and cloud computing. But we’re quickly moving into a new phase that’s all about machines acting in the real world.

Nvidia is building the control system for that future, and the scale of that opportunity is larger than anything the company has pursued before.

Huang’s CES keynote made it clear that Nvidia isn’t waiting for this future to arrive.

In September 2025, it launched the People-First AI Fund to support nonprofits “working at the intersection of innovation and public good.” Two months later, the foundation announced its first recipients.
If the People-First AI Fund can help recipients operate more efficiently, the initiative will emerge as a compelling case study of how a grantmaker can leverage AI to drive meaningful, short-term impact.
The fact that the foundation selected 208 People-First AI Fund recipients after reviewing close to 3,000 applications within two months suggests its officers were up to the task.
To this point, many People-First AI Fund grantees provide direct services in fields like veterans support, health, STEM education and food security.","In November of 2025, OpenAI restructured as a public benefit corporation — a for-profit company with a commitment to making a positive impact on society and the environment while generating financial return. The nonprofit that controlled OpenAI, rebranded as the OpenAI Foundation, received a 26% equity stake valued at $130 billion in OpenAI Group PBC.

The restructuring generated a litany of questions, not the least of which was what the OpenAI Foundation’s grantmaking would look like. Fortunately, the company had offered some clues in the run-up to the announcement.

In September 2025, it launched the People-First AI Fund to support nonprofits “working at the intersection of innovation and public good.” Two months later, the foundation announced its first recipients. It would disburse $40.5 million in unrestricted grants to 208 U.S.-based nonprofits by the end of the year, and a second wave of $9.5 million in board-directed grants would be announced in the following months.

At a time when some funders are grappling with ways to anticipate AI’s more profound impacts on society, People-First AI Fund grantees, some of which have never used AI or are in the early adoption phase, hope to leverage the technology to optimize service delivery in areas like mental health, education and food security.

Many organizations in the direct services field have struggled to generate sustainable philanthropic support in recent years, as small donor support declines, and some funders pivot to advocacy and organizing to address the root causes of problems. Federal funding cuts and lapsed foundation funding over the past 12 months have exacerbated this challenge. If the People-First AI Fund can help recipients operate more efficiently, the initiative will emerge as a compelling case study of how a grantmaker can leverage AI to drive meaningful, short-term impact.

“One thing the grantees have in common is that they’re community-driven,” said Daniel Zingale, who convened OpenAI’s nonprofit commission, which supported an engagement process to inform how OpenAI’s philanthropy can address long-term systemic issues. “And what we heard, wherever we went, was that AI should benefit all of humanity, and humanity needs a seat at the table.”

How the People-First AI Fund came together

The seeds of the fund were planted in April of last year, when OpenAI assembled a nonprofit commission tasked with informing OpenAI’s philanthropic efforts.

The company “communicated a genuine interest in getting community input,” said Zingale, who previously served as senior vice president of the The California Endowment and strategist to California Govs. Gavin Newsom and Arnold Schwarzenegger. “If you believe that AI carries with it extreme promise and extreme peril, then who are the people that you would want to tip that balance toward benefiting humanity?”

The commission’s advisors held listening sessions with over 100 organizations and over 500 individuals throughout California. “The commission called the shots in terms of whether we would do a listening tour and who we would invite,” he said. “I think we did a good job at getting cross-representation across the communities — faith-based groups, academia, community organizing, farm workers.”

The commission published its report in July. Its authors encouraged the company’s philanthropy to zero in on three priorities: invest in the people sector and close economic gaps, democratize the understanding and influence of AI, and unlock AI to transform and scale philanthropy.

In an October 28 post announcing the company’s restructuring, OpenAI Board of Directors Chair Bret Taylor said the OpenAI Foundation “will initially focus on a $25 billion commitment” across two areas: health and curing diseases, and supporting “practical technical solutions for AI resilience, which is about maximizing AI’s benefits and minimizing its risks.”

While Taylor’s post didn’t provide a timeline for disbursing those funds, I noted the potential challenge of scaling up the foundation’s grantmaking machinery. The fact that the foundation selected 208 People-First AI Fund recipients after reviewing close to 3,000 applications within two months suggests its officers were up to the task. The $40.5 million the foundation will disburse through the fund by the end of 2025 was a 440% increase over the previous year’s grantmaking outlay of $7.5 million.

“We tried to make the process user friendly and not burdensome or bureaucratic,” Zingale said. “Obviously, it needed to be thorough and done with integrity, but I think it demonstrated that it doesn’t have to put already strained community organizations through an arduous process.”

Contextualizing the People-First AI Fund within the larger funding ecosystem

Every funder wants to see AI developed in a way that benefits humanity. However — and at the risk of oversimplifying a large, interconnected and growing segment of the philanthrosphere — grantmakers’ AI-related work often falls into one of two buckets.

The first is more forward looking and conceptual in nature. Grantmakers seek to preserve the dignity of workers and the diminishment of human connection while staving off an AI-induced apocalypse. Funders tackling these issues include the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, Eric and Wendy Schmidt, Omidyar Network and the foundations behind the five-year, $500 million Humanity AI initiative.

The second bucket focuses on more tangible, short-term applications of AI to advance specific priority areas like global development (Gates Foundation), medical research (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative), education (Salesforce), economic mobility (NextLadder Ventures and Robin Hood’s AI Poverty Challenge) and children’s mental health (Google).

Obviously, funders can simultaneously work on both priorities by, for example, planning for a world of mass automation in 2075 while providing workers with the skills to land a job today. Regardless of the issue or timeline in question, funders aim to ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed equitably so that the technology benefits the many and not the few.

Generally speaking, the work conducted by the community-focused grantees of OpenAI Foundation’s People-First AI Fund falls into this second category by addressing what it calls “immediate needs.”

These include AI literacy and public understanding so people “can engage with AI in ways that matter for their lives”; community innovations to improve access to essential services and strengthen civic life; and economic opportunity in the form of “meaningful, fairly distributed work as AI changes the labor landscape.” The second wave of People-First AI Fund grants will support organizations “already advancing transformative AI work across areas like health.”

Using AI to more effectively deliver direct services

People-First AI Fund recipients have annual budgets between $500,000 and $10 million. Their familiarity with AI ranges from “figuring it out, or they’re very anxious to figure it out,” Zingale said. “That was a discovery for us, to find out that a small organization in a rural corner of Montana is already incorporating AI.”

Zingale’s commentary suggests that organizational leaders realize that the AI genie is out of the bottle. Rather than push back against it, they can embrace it — or, at the very least, thoughtfully explore ways in which the technology can advance their missions.

To this point, many People-First AI Fund grantees provide direct services in fields like veterans support, health, STEM education and food security. It goes without saying that it’s been rough sledding for direct service providers over the past year. Many organizations lost federal funding, and those that didn’t receive federal support to begin with had to contend with increased demand due to the cuts inflicted on organizations in their geographic region. Looking ahead, analysts fear that proposed cuts in President Donald Trump’s 2026 fiscal budget will add additional strain on direct services providers.

“There’s a hearty representation of direct service organizations” in People-First AI Fund’s cohort, Zingale said. “We didn’t position [the fund] as a kind of emergency relief response, but again, when you listen to community at this moment in time, what you hear is that direct service providers are in desperate need of relief, and so that found its way into this cohort of grantees.”

Given the profound challenges facing direct services organizations, it will be interesting to see how grantees harness AI to deliver services and the extent to which the OpenAI Foundation shares its insights with the broader field.

“I think there’s a general understanding that there’s no going back,” Zingale said. “So how to you go forward in a way that meets people’s needs — maybe with less resources, but done more efficiently? And I think that there’s a great deal of hope that AI is part of the solution.”",https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2677731345-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 13:03:01.043893

Alaska has a long history with Boeing, which makes the Max miles from the airline’s Seattle headquarters.
Alaska has a fleet of 413 planes, which it expects to grow to 475 by 2030, and to more than 550 by 2035.
The airline is the fifth largest in the United States, though its 8 percent market share is still only about half that of United Airlines, which ranks fourth.
United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines dominate the U.S. market.","Alaska Airlines said on Wednesday that it would buy 110 Boeing planes, part of an ambitious plan for growth fueled by its recent acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. The order is the largest in the airline’s history and will support Alaska’s expansion, including to destinations abroad.

“This fleet investment builds on the strong foundation Alaska has created to support steady, scalable and sustained growth,” Ben Minicucci, Alaska’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are incredibly proud to be partnering with Boeing, a Pacific Northwest neighbor and a company that stands as a symbol of American innovation and manufacturing.”

For Boeing, the deal contributes momentum to its turnaround since a harrowing incident two years ago when a panel blew off one of its 737 Max planes operated by Alaska Airlines. No one was seriously injured, but that flight raised concerns about the quality of Boeing’s planes and prompted major changes at the company.

Alaska did not disclose the value of the deal with Boeing, but typically an order of this size would cost billions of dollars. The airline will receive five 787 Dreamliners, two-aisle planes that it plans to use for long-distance international flights; and 105 Max 10s, the model’s largest version. The Max 8 and Max 9, single-aisle planes used for short and medium-haul routes, have been flying for years, with the Max 10 widely expected to be certified by federal authorities later this year.

Alaska has a long history with Boeing, which makes the Max miles from the airline’s Seattle headquarters. The airline has historically operated an all-Boeing fleet, though it acquired a few dozen Airbus planes in its merger with Hawaiian Airlines, which will continue to fly under Hawaiian’s own brand.

Alaska has a fleet of 413 planes, which it expects to grow to 475 by 2030, and to more than 550 by 2035. The airline is the fifth largest in the United States, though its 8 percent market share is still only about half that of United Airlines, which ranks fourth. United, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines dominate the U.S. market.

Alaska is in the middle of a major expansion, both on the West Coast and abroad. Last year, the airline began flying from Seattle to Tokyo and Seoul. This summer, it plans to add flights to Rome, London and Reykjavik, Iceland. Alaska recently revamped its loyalty program and is adding more premium seats to its planes while also building new airport lounges, all in an effort to attract and retain high-spending travelers.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/09/multimedia/07biz-boeing-alaska/09storm-pnw-hqfw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 14:04:10.402195

I'll be visiting soon.” | Ctech,Elihay Vidal,,,,,https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/sjnagzjeze,"LAS VEGAS - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered rare insight into the company’s operations in Israel at a press conference during CES 2026 on Tuesday, emphasizing the central role the country plays in the world’s most valuable technology company.
“Our team in Israel is incredible.
They're hardworking, they're smart, they're dedicated, they care about the company, they care about their people, they care about the country,” Huang said when asked about Nvidia’s presence in Israel.
“Nvidia’s BlueField-4 DPU and three networking components, the ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, NVLink 6 Switch, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch all came out of Israel.
We have people in our Israel office who have been with the company for 20-25 years.","LAS VEGAS - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered rare insight into the company’s operations in Israel at a press conference during CES 2026 on Tuesday, emphasizing the central role the country plays in the world’s most valuable technology company. Nvidia, with a market capitalization of approximately $4.55 trillion, has been operating in Israel since its $6.9 billion acquisition of networking firm Mellanox in 2019. The acquisition transformed Mellanox’s Yokneam headquarters into Nvidia’s primary Israeli hub, which now employs roughly 3,000 of the company’s 5,000 Israeli staff.

“Our team in Israel is incredible. They're hardworking, they're smart, they're dedicated, they care about the company, they care about their people, they care about the country,” Huang said when asked about Nvidia’s presence in Israel. “The sacrifices they make for each other, for their country, is incredible, and we’ve been very, very successful there.”

Huang highlighted Israel’s role in the development of key Nvidia chips. “Nvidia’s BlueField-4 DPU and three networking components, the ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, NVLink 6 Switch, and Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch all came out of Israel. So, four out of six chips came out of Israel. Pretty amazing. And maybe next time, six out of six chips.”

The CEO also emphasized the company’s culture and approach to talent management. “Our turnover is incredibly low. You know, it’s probably one or two percent in Israel. People stay for a very long time. We have people in our Israel office who have been with the company for 20-25 years. This is quite an extraordinary thing. Our ability to attract great people is second to none, and our ability to retain them is absolutely world class.”

Huang connected these achievements to Nvidia’s broader corporate philosophy: “We dedicate ourselves to choosing good work for the company to do, that’s one of the responsibilities of the CEO, to choose what kind of work we should be doing and what kind of work we shouldn’t be doing. The quality of the work, the purpose of the company, all of it comes together, and it’s pretty magical in Israel.”

The praise comes amid Nvidia’s ongoing expansion in the country. Last month, the company formally confirmed plans to establish a 160,000-square-meter campus in Kiryat Tivon, expected to employ roughly 10,000 workers. The facility will be built on 90 dunams of state-owned land granted with an exemption from public tender, representing one of the largest private technology investments in Israel in recent years.

Nvidia’s Israeli operations now represent a central node for the company’s global hardware development. Huang’s remarks underline not only the technological importance of Israel’s workforce but also the strategic commitment Nvidia has made to the country, a hub for advanced networking, AI, and high-performance computing technologies.",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2026/01/06/HkxXFbZjEWg/HkxXFbZjEWg_0_108_3000_1689_0_large.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 13:14:24.839376

Since launching its in-store digital display network, Albertsons Media Collective has delivered strong results and attracted more than 50 unique advertising partners eager to tap into the power of retail media, while staying focused on rapid growth and expansion.

Unlike traditional attribution models that assign credit to purchases that may have occurred anyway, Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market framework measures the true incremental impact of in-store media, isolating the effect of advertising as the sole driver of lift. The incrementality solution operates at the store level, comparing sales performance in test stores exposed to ads against a rigorously selected set of control stores with no media exposure. By estimating the counterfactual, what would have happened without advertising, the model delivers a statistically validated measure of true lift.

Albertsons Media Collective, NBCUniversal debut CTV closed-loop measurement

Albertsons Media Collective’s in-store incrementality measurement addresses one of the industry’s most persistent challenges: accurately measuring in-store media, which operates outside the signal-rich, identity-connected environment of other digital channels. Designed specifically to alleviate this complexity, the matched market framework delivers true incrementality by attributing sales, orders and unit lift solely to media exposure rather than correlation. The solution leverages nearly 60 variables for advanced store-level matching to reduce bias and noise, scales nationally across diverse store formats and works across both existing and new in-store screens, including deli and pharmacy placements.

“For too long, in-store media has been measured with tools that confuse correlation for impact,” said Liz Roche, vice president of media and measurement at Albertsons Media Collective. “Our matched market incrementality approach cuts through that noise. By isolating causal lift at the store level, we’re showing brands the actual impact of in-store media activation—and giving them confidence that their investment is driving net-new sales. We look forward to advancing the measurement capabilities we offer in the future with closed-loop measurement, while remaining compliant with and closely aligning our measurement roadmap with IAB current and future standards for in-store media.”

Albertsons Media Collective cited a recent campaign for Mondelēz International that it said highlights the effectiveness of in-store media when measured through Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market incrementality framework.

Designed to promote Sargento Cheese Bakes, a snack cracker from Mondelēz, the campaign aimed to drive household penetration, category growth and incremental sales. Mondelēz integrated in-store digital screens with high-engagement onsite and offsite media to build awareness and drive conversion among Albertsons shoppers. The addition of in-store screens contributed to a significant sales lift, demonstrating the incremental value of in-store activation within an omnichannel strategy.

“In-store is one of the most influential moments in the path to purchase, but historically it’s been difficult to measure with precision,” said Melissa Pitmon, customer director, OmniChannel, Mondelēz. “Albertsons Media Collective’s matched market measurement gave us clear, causal insight into how in-store media drove incremental sales, helping us optimize with confidence and validate the true impact of our investment.”

Albertsons Media Collective is a full-funnel media platform that reaches known shoppers across channels, now complete with in-store media which unlocks the full power of the omnichannel experience at the moments closest to the point of purchase. After bringing incrementality onsite and offsite, bringing incremental results to in-store media helps advertising partners truly understand collective growth.

Given the strong in-store results achieved since the launch of the in-store digital display network, Albertsons Media Collective is focused on expansion. In 2026, the in-store fleet will include about 800 additional stores, offering scaled coverage and strategic continuity, with presence across 10 divisions.",https://drugstorenews.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/2026-01/albertsons_instore_news_image_2.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 15:02:10.606823

CEO Jensen Huang tells Xu that his job is “to make everything that moves autonomous.” This is a crucial start.
“Everything that moves will ultimately be fully autonomous,” he said, also framing the era shift toward “physical AI,” with autonomous vehicles as one of the three categories of “robots” that matter.
Autonomy has spent years as a promise; Nvidia wants it to behave like infrastructure.
L2++ gets Nvidia into real cars without demanding a leap of faith, and Alpamayo pushes the hardest problems upstream into models and simulation — where Nvidia’s advantage is already industrial.","Nvidia is everywhere. Its logo has become the watermark of modern computing. It sits under AI-era compute, cloud infrastructure, PC graphics, and the industrial automation that’s quietly remaking factories. So why wouldn’t it want to take the wheel in the global autonomous vehicle push, too?

But Nvidia isn’t really chasing “self-driving cars.” Nvidia is doing something closer to chasing autonomy as an industrial stack — a set of chips, models, simulation tools, and safety systems that other companies can plug into, iterate on, and ship, without betting their entire company on a robotaxi moonshot. That framing sounds semantic until you sit inside one of Nvidia’s demo vehicles and listen to the company’s automotive leadership talk like they’re building a supply chain, not a sci-fi future.

Now, Nvidia’s first big “in cars” proof point has a pilot: The company’s Drive AV software is launching in the all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan, with an enhanced Level 2 (Nvidia calls it L2++) point-to-point driver-assistance system that Nvidia expects will hit U.S. roads this year. Mercedes is selling the tech, which it calls MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO for $3,950 for three years in the U.S., with monthly and yearly pricing still to come; Tesla, meanwhile, sells its Full Self-Driving for $8,000 a year or $99 a month. That’s great business for Mercedes, but it says something bigger about the changing AV landscape. What Nvidia is launching is the kind of autonomy that could actually ship at scale: driver assistance that still assumes a human behind the wheel — but with tech that Nvidia says can improve over time through software; the MB.OS design is built to enable over-the-air updates for future upgrades and features.

At a recent San Francisco ride-along tied to the Mercedes-Benz demo, Nvidia executives framed the company’s automotive push as a full-stack effort: the in-car computer, the models, the validation loop, and the industrial-scale training infrastructure behind it.

Xinzhou Wu, who leads Nvidia’s automotive group, said at the demo that the partnership has been over four years in the running, a full-stack and multiyear proof point for that mass-market approach. Under the hood — literally — Wu described what Nvidia is running in the demo vehicles: a “hybrid stack” that pairs an end-to-end model with a more traditional, “classical” stack that’s already deployed in Mercedes vehicles in Europe. The coupling is the point: The end-to-end model drives a more humanlike feel; the classical stack provides an interpretable backstop, with a “safety monitor” choosing the safer trajectory.

Physical AI, Wu said, is “a deep problem to solve for the next decade."" That frame positions Nvidia as the one vendor already built to supply all three layers — vehicle compute, data-center compute, simulation — and it reframes the autonomy arms race as a compute and tooling problem more than a map-and-sensors problem. In that worldview, the winners are the companies that can compress the loop: train faster, simulate more edge cases, deploy more safely, and keep the system improving without breaking the trust contract with drivers.

CEO Jensen Huang tells Xu that his job is “to make everything that moves autonomous.” This is a crucial start.

Underneath the architecture

Nvidia’s AV push is built to scale through partnerships like the one with Mercedes — the company supplying the compute-heavy backbone and tooling, and the automaker owning the vehicle, the brand, and the customer relationship. During the CLA test drive, Ali Kani, Nvidia’s VP of automotive, described the system in the most Nvidia way possible: as something engineered end-to-end, trained on Nvidia infrastructure, tested in the cloud, and gated by the process.

In a separate briefing, Kani zoomed out to full Nvidia-prophetic. “Everything that moves will ultimately be fully autonomous,” he said, also framing the era shift toward “physical AI,” with autonomous vehicles as one of the three categories of “robots” that matter. The rhetoric is big — maybe too big in an era where people still don’t entirely trust this technology — but it fits the underlying strategy: autonomy becomes another domain where Nvidia can supply... everything.

The near-term version, though, stays grounded in passenger-car reality: driver assistance, careful safety layering, and a partnership model designed to scale. The company isn’t trying to wrestle control of the wheel, rather building the system that makes more of the drive feel automatic — and then building the compute loop that enables that capability to improve. The global AV push has plenty of contenders chasing the spotlight. Nvidia’s move is quieter, more infrastructural, and therefore perhaps more dangerous in the way that platform plays tend to be.

Alpamayo, the long-tail bet

If the Mercedes CLA launch is Nvidia’s “in cars” proof point, Alpamayo is the part where Nvidia tries to turn autonomy into an ecosystem — and keep its hands on the tooling that determines who’s getting behind the wheel next.

Alpamayo is billed as a family of open-source models, simulation tools, and datasets aimed at “safe, reasoning-based” autonomous driving — specifically the ugly, rare “long tail” cases that still break systems in ways that never show up in a glossy demo loop. Nvidia’s attempt to make “reasoning” a product layer in autonomy and to standardize the upstream toolchain that improves systems over time. The pitch is that traditional autonomy architectures split perception and planning in ways that can limit scalability when something weird happens; end-to-end learning has moved the ball, but edge cases still demand models that can reason about cause and effect when the situation falls outside training experience.

Alpamayo introduces “chain-of-thought, reasoning-based” vision-language-action (VLA) models designed to think through novel scenarios step by step, with improved explainability that is “critical to scaling trust and safety,” according to the company, and the whole effort is “underpinned by the NVIDIA Halos safety system.” CEO Jensen Huang is leaning all the way into the moment-language, calling it “the ChatGPT moment for physical AI,” and arguing that Alpamayo can help vehicles “think through rare scenarios” and “explain their driving decisions,” as “the foundation for safe, scalable autonomy.”

Nvidia says Alpamayo models are teacher models, “rather than running directly in-vehicle,” meant to be fine-tuned and distilled into the runtime backbones of complete AV stacks. That makes Alpamayo feel less like “new feature coming to your Mercedes” and more like Nvidia trying to standardize the way autonomy gets built — the same platform instinct, aimed at the training/simulation layer where Nvidia already knows how to win.

Autonomy has spent years as a promise; Nvidia wants it to behave like infrastructure. L2++ gets Nvidia into real cars without demanding a leap of faith, and Alpamayo pushes the hardest problems upstream into models and simulation — where Nvidia’s advantage is already industrial. If this play works, the most important autonomy company won’t be the one with the biggest fleet. It’ll be the one that makes everyone else’s autonomy ship.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/Mercedes-Benz%20CLA%20L2%20Image.jpg",N,,2026-01-07 13:02:56.526729

The chips promise to eliminate water chiller requirements in data centers, potentially disrupting an established supply chain built around traditional cooling infrastructure.

Key Takeaways:

Johnson Controls and Trane Technologies dropped 7.5% and 5.3% respectively, hitting multi-month lows after Huang’s CES remarks

Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform, featuring six integrated chips now in full production, claims to eliminate water chiller needs in data center operations

Data centers contribute 10% of Trane Technologies’ revenue and low-double-digit percentages for Johnson Controls, putting substantial business at risk

Huang delivered his comments Monday evening at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where he revealed the Vera Rubin platform has entered full production ahead of its expected 2025 debut. His declaration that “no water chillers are necessary for data centres” sent immediate shockwaves through markets Tuesday morning.

Johnson Controls International plummeted to $112.40, while Trane Technologies sank to $370.40. Both companies ranked among the S&P 500’s worst performers for the session, reflecting investor concerns about their exposure to data center cooling contracts.

Barclays analysts, in research led by Julian Mitchell, acknowledged the gravity of Huang’s statements despite their initially dramatic tone. “Given the primacy of Nvidia to the whole AI ecosystem, one should not take their comments lightly,” they wrote, identifying the most vulnerable players in the cooling sector.

The investment bank’s analysis reveals varied exposure levels across manufacturers. Johnson Controls faces low-double-digit percentage dependence on data center sales, while Trane Technologies derives approximately 10% of revenue from this segment. Carrier Global, which saw shares decline 1.1%, has roughly 5% exposure.

Not every company in the infrastructure space faces headwinds from Nvidia’s announcement. Barclays pointed to potential beneficiaries, including nVent Electric, which avoids space cooling and chiller products but maintains solid positioning in data center liquid cooling systems. The firm’s shares edged 0.5% higher.

Vertiv Holdings, despite a 2.1% share decline, may also capitalize on the transition. The company brings established expertise in precision air cooling alongside competitive liquid cooling capabilities, positioning it to adapt as infrastructure requirements evolve.

The Vera Rubin platform combines six distinct Nvidia chips into an integrated system designed for AI workloads. The architecture apparently generates less heat than current solutions, enabling data centers to operate without traditional water-based cooling infrastructure that has dominated the industry for decades.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DH1L4415-HDR-20220527-r5-resize.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:01:07.474492

In Walmart U.S., grocery delivered a low single-digit comparable sales increase during the period, with growth in both transactions and unit volumes.

Grocery strength was led by fresh food sales, followed by pantry items. Consumables also posted growth, supported by categories such as personal care and beauty. Management noted that grocery performance remained broad-based, even as the company lapped prior-year impacts related to port disruptions.

Value execution remained a consistent theme in grocery during the quarter. Walmart had approximately 7,400 active rollbacks in Walmart U.S., with more than half of those rollbacks concentrated in grocery. The company reiterated that many of these Rollbacks are structured as 90-day price reductions, and management said that more than 2,000 rollbacks since the beginning of the year have transitioned into new everyday low prices.

Inflation levels in Walmart U.S. moderated during the quarter. Like-for-like inflation was 1.3% in Walmart U.S., with food and general merchandise inflation running at low single-digit levels. Grocery performance also benefited from Walmart’s omnichannel execution. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales increased 28% in the quarter, with management highlighting strong growth in store-fulfilled pickup and delivery. Nearly 50% growth was reported in store-fulfilled delivery, and management stated that approximately 35% of store-fulfilled digital orders were delivered in under three hours during the quarter.

Walmart U.S. saw share gains across income brackets in the third quarter, including higher-income households. Grocery was cited alongside health and wellness and general merchandise as categories contributing to those gains. Overall, grocery appears to be a consistent traffic driver within Walmart U.S., supported by price rollbacks, everyday low pricing and improving fulfillment speed.

Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement.

The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.

SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OF THE NOTES

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, the following provisions will apply for purposes of the Notes.

Market Disruption Events

If the Calculation Agent determines that, on the Initial Valuation Date or any Observation Date (each, a “Valuation Date”), a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Underlier, that Valuation Date will be postponed to the immediately succeeding Index Business Day (as defined under “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement) on which no Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing. In no event, however, will a Valuation Date be postponed by more than five scheduled Index Business Days. If the Calculation Agent determines that a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Underlier on that fifth day, the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Value of the Underlier for that fifth day in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.

If any Observation Date is postponed, the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment Date will be postponed such that the number of business days from the Observation Date to the Contingent Coupon Payment Date remains the same.

With respect to the Notes, a “Market Disruption Event” means:

●the occurrence of a Trading Disruption Event, an Index Market Disruption Event or an Index Disruption Event (each as defined and described under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement); or

●the failure of the Index Sponsor to calculate and publish the official closing level of the Underlier on an Index Business Day

in each case as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion.

Discontinuation of the Underlier; Alteration of Methodology or Calculation of the Underlier

If the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Underlier and the Index Sponsor or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the discontinued Index (such index being referred to herein as a “Successor Index”), then the Closing Value of the Underlier on any relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined will be determined by reference to the level of that Successor Index at the time of daily final publication, or close of trading on the relevant exchange or market for that Successor Index, as applicable, on that date. If a Successor Index is selected by the Calculation Agent, the Successor Index will be used as a substitute for the Underlier for all purposes under the Notes, and the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion adjust any variable described in this pricing supplement, including but not limited to any level (including but not limited to the Initial Underlier Value, the Coupon Barrier Value, the Barrier Value, the Final Underlier Value and the Closing Value on any relevant date), or any combination thereof. The Calculation Agent will make any such adjustment with a view to offsetting, to the extent practicable, any difference in the relative levels of the Index and the Successor Index at the time the Index is replaced by the Successor Index.

If an Index Cancellation occurs on or prior to any Observation Date or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined and is continuing on that date, then the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion determine to compute the Closing Value of the Underlier in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the Underlier or Successor Index, as applicable, last in effect prior to that Index Cancellation.

An “Index Cancellation” will occur if (a) the Index Sponsor discontinues publication of the Closing Value of the Underlier on or prior to any Observation Date (or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined) and that discontinuation is continuing on that day and the Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Index is available at that time or (b) the Calculation Agent has previously selected a Successor Index and publication of that Successor Index is discontinued prior to, and that discontinuation is continuing on, any Observation Date (or any other relevant date on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is to be determined).

If at any time the method of calculating the Underlier or a Successor Index, or the level thereof, is changed in a material respect, or if the Underlier or a Successor Index is in any other way modified such that the Underlier or that Successor Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the level of the Underlier or that Successor Index had those changes or modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion determine to make such calculations and adjustments as the Calculation Agent determines may be necessary in order to arrive at a level for the Underlier or Successor Index comparable to the Underlier or Successor Index, as the case may be, as if those changes or modifications had not been made, and determine whether the Notes are automatically redeemed and calculate the payment at maturity or any other payment to be made on the Notes with reference to the Underlier (or Successor Index), as adjusted.

Material Index Amendment Events

If a Material Index Amendment Event occurs prior to the Final Valuation Date, the Calculation Agent may elect in its sole discretion to cause the Maturity Date to be accelerated to a date no later than the tenth business day following the occurrence of that Material Index Amendment Event. In the event of such an acceleration, the amount payable in respect of the Notes on the Maturity Date as so

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-18 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF CONTINGENT COUPON PAYMENTS DURING THE TERM OF THE NOTES

The following examples demonstrate the circumstances under which you may receive Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are not automatically redeemed.

* The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 and the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value or Coupon Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value will be equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlier Value.

For information regarding recent values of the Underlier, please see “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” in this pricing supplement.

Example 1: The Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the first and second Observation Dates, but the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each other Observation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first and second Observation Dates, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.958 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1958% of the principal amount) on each related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the remaining Observation Dates, the Contingent Coupons applicable to those Observation Dates will not be payable at any time.

Example 2: The Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates, but the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than the Coupon Barrier Value on the first and final Observation Dates.

Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the first Observation Date, you will receive a Contingent Coupon of $11.958 per $1,000 principal amount Note (1.1958% of the principal amount) on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. Because the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates, the Contingent Coupons applicable to those Observation Dates will not be payable on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Dates; however, because the Closing Value of the Underlier on the final Observation Date is greater than the Coupon Barrier Value, the Contingent Coupons that would have been paid on the second through fifty-ninth Contingent Coupon Payment Dates had the Closing Value of the Underlier been greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the second through fifty-ninth Observation Dates will be paid on the final Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following table and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: 100.00*

■Hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value: 70.00 (70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■Hypothetical Barrier Value: 50.00 (50.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlier Value set forth above)*

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT automatically redeemed.

* The hypothetical Initial Underlier Value of 100.00, the hypothetical Coupon Barrier Value of 70.00 and the hypothetical Barrier Value of 50.00 have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and may not represent a likely actual Initial Underlier Value, Coupon Barrier Value or Barrier Value. The actual Initial Underlier Value will be equal to the Closing Value of the Underlier on the Initial Valuation Date, and the actual Coupon Barrier Value and Barrier Value will be equal to 70.00% and 50.00%, respectively, of the Initial Underlier Value.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The value of the Underlier increases from an Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of 150.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

Example 1 demonstrates that you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Underlier. Even though the Underlier appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

Example 2: The value of the Underlier decreases from an Initial Underlier Value of 100.00 to a Final Underlier Value of 80.00.

Because the Final Underlier Value is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus the Contingent Coupon and any Unpaid Contingent Coupons otherwise due).

INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNDERLIER

The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index (the “Index”) is a rules-based proprietary index created and owned by Barclays Bank PLC. The Index is operated by Barclays Index Administration, a distinct function within Barclays Bank PLC (in such capacity, the “Index Sponsor”). The Index Sponsor has appointed a third party, MerQube, Inc. (together with any successor thereto, the “Index Calculation Agent”), to calculate and maintain the Index. The Index is reported by Bloomberg under the ticker symbol “BXIIUT4E.”

The Index attempts to provide variable exposure of up to 400% to the Barclays US Tech Tracker ER Index (the “Futures Index”), with greater exposure when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower (subject to the maximum exposure of 400%) and lesser exposure when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher (subject to a minimum exposure of 100%). The Futures Index tracks the excess return of a notional rolling position in the first nearby futures contract on the Nasdaq-100 Index® (the “Reference Index”). For more information about the Futures Index, see “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Background on the Barclays US Tech Tracker ER Index” in the accompanying underlying supplement. The Reference Index is designed to measure the performance of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. For more information about the Reference Index, see “Indices—The Nasdaq-100 Index®” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

The Index is subject to a 6% per annum decrement, deducted daily. The decrement will offset appreciation of the Futures Index, heighten depreciation of the Futures Index and generally act as a drag on the performance of the Index. The Index will trail the performance of an identical index without a decrement.

The Index applies an exposure (the “Index Exposure”) of between 100% and 400% to the Futures Index, with the aim of increasing exposure (subject to the maximum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower and decreasing exposure (subject to the minimum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher. The Index Exposure is not adjusted according to a predetermined schedule. Instead, on each Index Business Day (as defined below), the Index determines a new target exposure to the Futures Index, but the Index Exposure will be adjusted only if the new target exposure differs sufficiently from the current Index Exposure. Otherwise, the Index will maintain its current Index Exposure.

On each Index Business Day, the target exposure of the Index to the performance of the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is set equal to (a) a volatility level of 40% (the “volatility threshold”) divided by (b) the realized volatility of the Futures Index, subject to a maximum exposure of 400% and a minimum exposure of 100%. The Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index will equal the maximum exposure of 400% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is less than or equal to 10% and will equal the minimum exposure of 100% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is greater than or equal to 40%. The Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index will be between 400% and 100% when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is between 10% and 40%. For example, if the realized volatility of the Futures Index is equal to 20%, the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will equal 200% (or 40% / 20%). No assurance can be provided that the realized volatility of the Index will approximate the volatility threshold. The realized volatility of the Index may be greater or less than the volatility threshold, perhaps significantly.

The Index Exposure remains unchanged on each Index Business Day, unless a newly calculated target exposure based on the realized volatility of the Futures Index on a subsequent Index Business Day would be, on an absolute basis, 40% or more above or below the current Index Exposure. For example, if the Index Exposure is 200%, the Index Exposure will remain unchanged unless the target exposure is greater than 240% or less than 160%. If an Index Exposure adjustment is triggered, the Index will adjust the Index Exposure on the immediately following Index Business Day (a “Rebalancing Day”), subject to the occurrence of a Trading Disruption Event (as defined and described under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index” in the accompanying underlying supplement).

The Index Calculation Agent began calculating the Index on a live basis on April 22, 2025.

“Index Business Day” means any day on which the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (or any successor thereto) is scheduled to be open for business for equity futures contracts.

The Index is an “excess return” index, and not a “total return” index, because the Futures Index provides notional exposure to futures contract returns that reflect changes in the price of those futures contracts and does not reflect interest that could be earned on funds notionally committed to the trading of futures contracts, resulting in an implicit financing cost.

Certain features of the Index, including the decrement described above, are designed to make it possible for certain economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you than would otherwise be the case, all else being equal. However, there can be no assurance that these more favorable terms will offset the negative effects of these features on the performance of the Index, and your return on the Notes may ultimately be less favorable than it would have been without these more favorable terms but with an index that does not contain these features.

The Index is subject to risks associated with the use of significant leverage. When leverage is employed, any movements in the values of the Futures Index will result in greater changes in the value of the Index than if leverage were not used. In particular, the use of leverage will magnify any negative performance of the Futures Index, which, in turn, would negatively affect the performance of the Index. The use of leverage will cause the volatility of the Index to be greater, perhaps

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underlier, the Futures Index, the Reference Index or their components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not automatically redeemed, and if the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes—The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date a Contingent Coupon plus all previously Unpaid Contingent Coupons, if any, only if the Closing Value of the Underlier on an Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Underlier on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date will not be payable on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Contingent Coupon is not paid on any Contingent Coupon Payment Date, that Contingent Coupon will be paid as an Unpaid Contingent Coupon on a later Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Underlier on a subsequent Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of the Underlier—The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Underlier, which may be significant, even though you will be fully exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Underlier from the Initial Underlier Value if the Notes are not automatically redeemed and the Final Underlier Value is less than the Barrier Value.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Will Be Different Depending on the Sequence of Closing Value of the Underlier on Different Observation Dates—Depending on the sequence in which the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on specific Observation Dates (if at all), you could receive a lesser or greater return regardless of the number of Observation Dates on which the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. For example, if the Closing Value of the Underlier is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first fifty-nine Observation Dates but is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on the final Observation Date, you will receive sixty Contingent Coupons (fifty-nine in the form of Unpaid Contingent Coupons). However, if the Closing Value of the Underlier is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on each of the first two Observation Dates but on no subsequent Observation Dates, you will receive only two Contingent Coupons, even though the Closing Value of the Underlier was greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value on twice as many Observation Dates as in the previous example.

●Automatic Redemption and Reinvestment Risk—If the Notes are automatically redeemed, the holding period over which you may receive Contingent Coupons could be as short as approximately one year. The payment upon an automatic redemption, together with any Contingent Coupons that you may have received on prior Contingent Coupon Payment Dates, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been automatically redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are automatically redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after an automatic redemption. The automatic redemption feature of the Notes may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the Underlier determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Automatic Redemption—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any automatic redemption. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Underlier has increased from the Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk—Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The Contingent Coupon is determined based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Underlier. The Contingent Coupon will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would be if the level of expected volatility of the Underlier taken into account in determining the terms of the Notes were lower. As volatility of the Underlier increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Underlier on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Underlier Value will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher Contingent Coupon reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive Contingent Coupons with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the Contingent Coupon been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive Contingent Coupons and/or that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index or the Securities Composing the Reference Index—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or the securities composing the Reference Index. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have any rights with respect to the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing the Reference Index would have.

●Tax Treatment—Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier Generally

●The Index May Not Be Successful or Outperform Any Alternative Investment Strategy That Might Be Employed with Respect to the Futures Index—There can be no assurance that the investment strategy on which the Index is based will be successful or that the Index will outperform any alternative strategy that might be employed with respect to the Futures Index.

●The Value of the Index Will Reflect a 6% per Annum Decrement, Deducted Daily—The performance of the Index will be reduced by the decrement of 6% per annum, deducted daily. As a result of the decrement, the Index performance will trail that of a hypothetical, identically constituted index from which no such decrement is deducted.

The decrement will place a significant drag on the performance of the Index, potentially offsetting positive returns on the Index’s investment strategy, exacerbating negative returns of its investment strategy and causing the value of the Index to decline steadily if the return of its investment strategy is relatively flat. The Index will not appreciate unless the return of its investment strategy is sufficient to offset the negative effect of the decrement, and then only to the extent that the return of its investment strategy is greater than the decrement. As a result of the decrement, the value of the Index may decline even if the return of its investment strategy is positive.

●The Index Is Subject to Risks Associated with the Use of Significant Leverage—The Index applies an exposure of between 100% and 400% to the Futures Index, with the aim of increasing exposure (subject to the maximum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively lower and decreasing exposure (subject to the minimum exposure) when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is relatively higher. Under normal market conditions in the past, the Futures Index has tended to exhibit a realized volatility below 40%. Accordingly, based on hypothetical back-tested and historical performance, the Index has

generally employed leverage in the past, except during periods of elevated volatility. When leverage is employed, any movements in the value of the Futures Index will result in greater changes in the value of the Index than if leverage were not used. In particular, the use of leverage will magnify any negative performance of the Futures Index, as well as the negative effect of the implicit financing cost embedded in the Futures Index, which, in turn, would negatively affect the performance of the Index. The use of leverage will cause the volatility of the Index to be greater, perhaps significantly greater, than the volatility of the Futures Index, and no assurance can be given that the annualized realized volatility of the Index will approximate the volatility threshold of 40%. The exposure of the Index to the Futures Index may be relatively high during periods of negative performance of the Futures Index and/or relatively low during periods of positive performance of the Futures Index, which would adversely affect the performance of the Index, perhaps significantly. In situations where a significant increase in volatility of the Futures Index is accompanied by a significant decline in the value of the Futures Index, the value of the Index may decline significantly before the next Rebalancing Day when the Index’s exposure to the Futures Index would be reduced. If, on any Index Business Day, the value of the Index as calculated is negative or zero, the value of the Index on that Index Business Day will be zero, and the value of the Index will stay at zero. In this scenario, you will not receive any further Contingent Coupons and you will lose the entire principal amount of your Notes at maturity.

●The Index Is Subject to Risks Associated with Its Methodology for Setting the Index Exposure—No assurance can be given that the Index’s methodology for setting the Index Exposure will be successful or outperform any alternative strategy that might be employed with respect to setting the Index Exposure.

On each Index Business Day, the target exposure of the Index to the performance of the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is set equal to (a) the volatility threshold of 40% divided by (b) the realized volatility of the Futures Index, subject to a maximum exposure of 400% and a minimum exposure of 100%. On any Index Business Day, the realized volatility of the Futures Index used to determine the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index on the following Index Business Day is equal to the lower of the short-term realized volatility of the Futures Index and the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index. The short-term realized volatility and long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index on an Index Business Day are calculated based on the daily returns of the Futures Index from the base date of the Index to that Index Business Day, with half-lives of 5 and 21 Index Business Days, respectively.

There is no guarantee that the methodology used by the Index to determine the realized volatility of the Futures Index will be representative of the realized volatility that the Futures Index will experience. Realized volatility is backward looking, and there is no guarantee that trends exhibited by historical realized volatility will continue in the future. In addition, the volatility of the Futures Index on any day may change quickly and unexpectedly, but it may take time for the realized volatility referenced by the Index to fully reflect those changes and for the target exposure of the Index to be adjusted accordingly. In particular, since the Index references the lower of the short-term and the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index, if the short-term realized volatility of the Futures Index increases suddenly, the Index’s target exposure to the Futures Index may not be reduced unless and until the long-term realized volatility of the Futures Index also increases. In addition, the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will not be further reduced when the realized volatility of the Futures Index exceeds 40% due to the minimum exposure, and the target exposure of the Index to the Futures Index will not be further increased when the realized volatility of the Futures Index is below 10% due to the maximum exposure. Furthermore, the Index Exposure will be adjusted only if the newly calculated target exposure is, on an absolute basis, 40% or more above or below the current Index Exposure.

●The Index May Be Adversely Affected by a “Volatility Drag” Effect—The Index may be subject to a “volatility drag” effect due to the resetting leveraged exposure to the Futures Index. The drag effect is likely to occur when the value of the Futures Index moves in one direction prior to an Index Exposure adjustment and the other direction following that Index Exposure adjustment. Resetting the exposure of the Index after an increase but in advance of a decline in the Futures Index would cause the Index to have increased exposure to that decline, and resetting the exposure following a decline but in advance of an increase in the Futures Index would cause the Index to have decreased exposure to that increase. The more this fact pattern repeats, the lower the performance of the Index will be relative to the performance of the Futures Index. The Index may rebalance as frequently as daily, and the Index may be subject to a greater drag effect compared with an identical index that rebalances less frequently.

●The Index Sponsor Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Closing Value of the Index and the Amount Payable on the Notes and Their Market Value and Create Conflicts of Interest—The Index Sponsor, a distinct function within Barclays Bank PLC, is responsible for the operation of the Index, and the policies of the Index Sponsor concerning the calculation of the Closing Value of the Index could affect the Closing Value of the Index and, therefore, the amount payable on the Notes at maturity and the market value of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity.

The Index Sponsor may modify the methodology for calculating the Closing Value of the Index. In addition, as described in “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement, the Index Sponsor may make certain changes to the way in which the Index is calculated. For example, the Index Sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the Index upon the occurrence of certain market disruptions or other events, in which case it may become difficult to determine the Closing Value of the Index and the value of the Notes. In addition, the Index Sponsor may replace the Futures Index as the underlying index if a material change is made to the calculation methodology of the Futures Index or the Reference Index. The replacement underlying index may perform significantly worse than the Futures Index. Any such changes could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The circumstances in which the Index Sponsor might make any such a determination are described more fully under “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The

Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, if a modification to the Index or the Futures Index constitutes a Material Index Amendment Event, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly. See “Supplemental Terms of the Notes—Material Index Amendment Events” above.

The role played by the Index Sponsor, and the exercise of the kinds of discretion described above and in the section entitled “Indices—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—The Barclays US Tech Accelerator 6% Decrement USD ER Index—Additional Index Determinations” in the accompanying underlying supplement, could present it with significant conflicts of interest in light of the fact that Barclays Bank PLC is the issuer of the Notes. The Index Sponsor has no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into consideration at any time.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or the Underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●The Index Has a Limited Performance History—The Index Calculation Agent began calculating the Index on a live basis on April 22, 2025, and the Index Sponsor has published limited information about how the Index might have performed had it been calculated in the past. Because the Index is new and limited historical performance data exists, your investment in the Notes may involve a greater risk than investing in alternate securities linked to one or more indices with an established record of performance. A longer history of actual performance would be helpful in providing more reliable information on which to assess the validity of the methodology that the Index uses as the basis for an investment decision.

●Hypothetical Back-Tested Data Relating to the Index Does Not Represent Actual Historical Data and Is Subject to Inherent Limitations—All data relating to the period prior to the launch date of the Index, including the table and graphs set forth under “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” below, is purely theoretical and does not represent the actual historical performance of the Index and has not been verified by an independent third party. The information is based on a hypothetical estimate by the Index Sponsor using available historical data as to how the Index may have performed in the pre-launch date period. Alternative modeling techniques or assumptions may produce different hypothetical historical information that might prove to be more appropriate and that might differ significantly from the hypothetical historical information set forth under “Historical and Hypothetical Historical Performance of the Underlier” below. In addition, back-tested, hypothetical historical results have inherent limitations. These back-tested results are achieved by means of a retroactive application of a back-tested model designed with the benefit of hindsight. Hypothetical back-tested data should not be taken as an indication of future performance.

●Historical or Hypothetical Historical Levels of the Index Should Not Be Taken as an Indication of the Future Performance of the Index During the Term of the Notes—The actual performance of the Index over the term of the Notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, may bear little relation to the historical or hypothetical historical levels of the Index. Past fluctuations and trends in the Index are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations or trends that may occur in the future.

●The Index Is Not Actively Managed—The Index operates by pre-determined rules, as described under “Information Regarding the Underlier” in this pricing supplement. There will be no active management of the Index to enhance returns or limit losses. An actively managed investment may potentially respond more directly and appropriately to immediate market, political, economic, financial or other factors than the non-actively managed Index, which may adversely affect the Closing Value of the Index and the value of the Notes.

●The Index Is Comprised of Synthetic Assets and Liabilities—The exposure to the Futures Index at any given time is purely synthetic and will exist solely in the records maintained by or on behalf of the Index Sponsor. There is no actual portfolio of assets to which any person or entity is entitled or in which any person or entity has any ownership interest. Consequently, no person or entity will have any claim against any of the components of the Futures Index or the Reference Index at any time.

Risks Relating to the Futures Index

●The Futures Index Reflects the Price Return of the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index, Not the Total Return—The performance of the Index, and therefore the return on the Notes, is based on the performance of the Futures Index, which reflects changes in the market prices of the futures contracts composing the Futures Index and positive or negative yields associated with rolling those futures contracts. The Futures Index (and, in turn, the Index) is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price and roll returns, would also reflect interest on a hypothetical cash position collateralizing the futures contracts composing the Futures Index. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to the Futures Index Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes—The sponsor of the Futures Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the futures contracts composing the Futures Index or make other methodological changes to the

Futures Index that could affect its performance, and the sponsor of the Reference Index may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing the Reference Index or make other methodological changes to the Reference Index that could affect the performance of the Futures Index. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the Futures Index and, consequently, the value of the Notes.

●The Performance of the Futures Index Will Differ from the Performance of the Reference Index—A variety of factors can lead to a disparity between the performance of an equity index futures contract and its reference index, including the expected dividend yields of the equity securities included in the reference index, an implicit financing cost associated with the futures contract and policies of the exchange on which the futures contracts are traded, such as margin requirements. A decline in expected dividends yields or an increase in margin requirements may adversely affect the performance of the Futures Index. In addition, the implicit financing cost will negatively affect the performance of the Futures Index, with a greater negative effect when market interest rates are higher. During periods of high market interest rates, the Futures Index is likely to underperform the Reference Index, perhaps significantly. The negative effect of the implicit financing cost will be magnified when the Index is exposed on a leveraged basis to the Futures Index.

●Negative Roll Returns Associated with the Futures Contracts Composing the Futures Index May Adversely Affect the Value of the Futures Index and the Value of the Notes—Unlike equity securities, the futures contracts composing the Futures Index, by their terms, have stated expirations. As the futures contracts composing the Futures Index approach expiration, they are replaced by contracts of the same series that have a later expiration. For example, a futures contract notionally purchased and held in June may specify a September expiration date. As time passes, the contract expiring in September is replaced by a contract for delivery in December. This is accomplished by notionally selling the September contract and notionally purchasing the December contract. This process is referred to as “rolling.” Excluding other considerations, if prices are higher in the distant delivery months than in the nearer delivery months, the notional purchase of the December contract would take place at a price that is higher than the price of the September contract, thereby creating a negative “roll return.” Negative roll returns adversely affect the returns on the futures contracts composing the Futures Index and, therefore, the value of the Futures Index and any payments on, and the value of, the Notes. Because of the potential effects of negative roll returns, it is possible for the value of the Futures Index to decrease significantly over time, even when the levels of the Reference Index are stable or increasing.

●The Futures Index Is Subject to Significant Risks Associated with Futures Markets—Futures markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, the participation of speculators and government regulation and intervention. In addition, futures exchanges generally have regulations that limit the amount of the futures contract price fluctuations that may occur in a single day. These limits are generally referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” and the maximum or minimum price of a contract on any given day as a result of those limits is referred to as a “limit price.” Once the limit price has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit, or trading may be limited for a set period of time. Limit prices have the effect of precluding trading in a particular contract or forcing the liquidation of contracts at potentially disadvantageous times or prices. These circumstances could delay the calculation of the value of the Futures Index. These factors and others can cause the prices of the futures contracts composing the Futures Index to be volatile and could adversely affect the value of the Futures Index and any payments on, and the value of, your Notes.

●There Are Risks Associated with Investments in Securities Linked to the Value of Non-U.S. Equity Securities—Some of the equity securities composing the Reference Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Furthermore, the role played by Barclays Index Administration in its role as Index Sponsor creates additional conflicts of interest. See “—Risks Relating to the Underlier Generally—The Index Sponsor Will Have the Authority to Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Closing Value of the Index and the Amount Payable on the Notes and their Market Value and Create Conflicts of Interest” above.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe value and expected volatility of the Underlier;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

odividend rates on the securities included in the Reference Index;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing topurchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.”

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss if you hold the Notes for more than one year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:02.761420

Enjoy the ride with Eli Lilly while it lasts While there is no way to predict the future, Eli Lilly faces very clear risks.","Eli Lilly's (LLY +3.52%) stock price has increased by approximately 35% over the past year. It has risen nearly 200% over the past three years. And it has rallied more than 500% over the past five years. If you bought this stock five years ago, you have benefited from its skyrocketing rise. What's behind this performance, and can it last?

Eli Lilly takes the lead from Novo Nordisk

The big story surrounding Eli Lilly is its leading position in the GLP-1 weight loss drug market. Its two GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have been massive hits. In fact, in the third quarter of 2025, Mounjaro's sales rose a huge 109% year over year. That astounding growth was eclipsed by Zepbound, which saw sales increase a shocking 185% in the quarter.

Sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound have been such a powerful driver of Eli Lilly's performance that they made up 57% of the company's sales in the third quarter of 2025. What's interesting here is that Eli Lilly was actually the second pharmaceutical company to market with a GLP-1 drug. The first to market was Novo Nordisk (NVO +1.92%).

The facts just laid out set the stage for the story behind the hidden risk that investors face with Eli Lilly's soaring stock. The unfortunate part is that the risk is, really, just business as usual in the highly competitive, technical, and regulated healthcare sector.

What happens if Eli Lilly isn't the GLP-1 king?

It is clear that Wall Street is rewarding Eli Lilly for its dominance in the GLP-1 space. While the stock's 53 times price-to-earnings ratio isn't out of line with its five-year average for this metric, it is far above the average pharma stock's P/E of around 30 times. If that dominance were to be challenged or lost, investors would likely react by repricing the shares, ultimately affording them a lower valuation.

The first sign of such a threat is already here, as Novo Nordisk received FDA approval to sell a pill version of its GLP-1 drug. GLP-1 shots have been a bit hit, but people prefer pills over shots. It wouldn't be surprising to see Novo Nordisk's pill regain some market share from Eli Lilly. This type of innovation is relatively common in the pharmaceutical industry. Eli Lilly's GLP-1 offering was, basically, just a better product, and it quickly gained a leading market position.

There's a very real possibility that Eli Lilly's GLP-1 drugs could lose ground to a more effective weight loss drug or a more convenient delivery method. To be fair, Eli Lilly isn't sitting around doing nothing. It is also working on a pill, but so are other companies.

For example, Pfizer (PFE +0.71%) just acquired a company with a promising weight-loss drug pipeline, and it agreed to distribute a Chinese company's GLP-1 pill if that pill is approved.

This risk is exacerbated by the fact that Eli Lilly is so heavily reliant on GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound to support its top line. However, there's a risk to consider even if Eli Lilly remains the dominant GLP-1 company. Pharmaceutical companies are granted a time-limited period of exclusivity to sell drugs they discover. That's meant to help the companies recoup the costs of developing important drugs. When patent protection expires, however, companies often face what is known as a patent cliff.

A patent cliff occurs when generic versions of a blockbuster drug begin to pull sales away from the original blockbuster. While Eli Lilly has a while to go before it faces a patent cliff with Mounjaro and Zepbound, it is inevitable that it will eventually face one. Given the importance of these two drugs to the company's income statement, the loss of patent protection will pose a significant problem.

Enjoy the ride with Eli Lilly while it lasts

While there is no way to predict the future, Eli Lilly faces very clear risks. None of the risks, however, is unusual for a drug company. The major issue is that the risks are exacerbated by the significance of Mounjaro and Zepbound to Eli Lilly's business. If you own or buy Eli Lilly because of its leading position in the GLP-1 drug space, you should carefully consider a future in which the company's GLP-1 drugs aren't as important to the world and the company as they are today.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849520%2F25_02_28-people-in-business-attire-leaving-the-starting-line-on-a-track-_mf-dload-gettyimages-89285817-1200x800-5b2df79.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:30.094422
ID8,BNY Mellon,2026-01-07 14:58:50+00:00,Investing News Network (INN),Critical Minerals Take Center Stage as U.S. Accelerates Push for Domestic Supply Security,Investing News Network,,,,,https://investingnews.com/critical-minerals-take-center-stage-as-u-s-accelerates-push-for-domestic-supply-security/,"For investors, the U.S. government's evolving approach significantly improves the risk-reward profile of domestic critical minerals projects.
Historical exploration efforts culminated in a historical mineral resource estimate published by the Slovak Geological institute in 1992 (see ""Historical Resource Estimates"" in the press release issued today).
For additional information relating to the historical estimate see below under the heading ""Historical Resource Estimates"".
The current drill program supports this work by seeking to confirm historical results and validate preliminary resource models.
""Hatch brings the depth, discipline, and proven execution capability required to responsibly deliver the Stibnite Gold Project,"" said Jon Cherry, President and CEO of Perpetua Resources.","The Western world is entering a strategic race to secure domestic supplies of critical minerals, creating a compelling opportunity set for investors focused on resource security and long-term value for active miners that include Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF) (CSE: MILI), Perpetua Resources Corp. (NASDAQ: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA), United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE American: UAMY), MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Critical Metals Corp. (NASDAQ: CRML). Antimony and gold are moving to the forefront as strategically vital materials: antimony for defense systems, semiconductors, and advanced energy applications, and gold for financial stability, electronics, and secure communications. With global supply highly concentrated outside the U.S. and its allies, these markets are increasingly shaped by geopolitical risk, positioning domestic producers as scarce, strategic assets with growing pricing power. Chinese export restrictions of metals such as antimony have further exposed the vulnerability of Western supply chains, reinforcing the urgency for domestically anchored alternatives. From a market value perspective, critical minerals represent a rapidly expanding investment theme measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars globally, with demand expected to accelerate through the next decade. Gold remains one of the largest and most liquid commodity markets in the world, valued in the trillions with consistent institutional demand, while antimony—though smaller in absolute size—commands premium pricing due to its limited supply base and lack of substitutes in many defense and industrial applications. As supply constraints tighten and governments prioritize secure sourcing, both metals are poised to benefit from structurally higher prices and long-term demand visibility, enhancing project economics for domestic producers. Securing domestic supply from allied jurisdictions has become a cornerstone of this strategy, reinforcing resilience by prioritizing production in politically stable, transparent, and defense-aligned countries.

For investors, the U.S. government's evolving approach significantly improves the risk-reward profile of domestic critical minerals projects. Direct federal support—through grants, low-cost financing, offtake agreements, and potential equity participation—is reducing capital risk and accelerating development timelines. Complementary policies such as tax incentives, permitting reform, Defense Production Act funding, and strategic stockpiling are creating clearer demand signals and more predictable revenue frameworks. As capital increasingly flows toward assets aligned with national security and supply chain resilience, domestic antimony and gold projects offer investors exposure to policy-backed growth, downside protection, and the potential for premium valuations as strategic scarcity intensifies.

(CSE: MILI) (OTCQB: MILIF) (FSE: QN90) (the ""Company"" or ""MILI""), is pleased to report the first analytical results of the Company's definition drilling campaign at the 100% owned flagship Trojarová Antimony Gold Project (the ""Project"") in Slovakia as announced on November 4, 2025. The holes were designed to confirm historical drilling results and to support SLR Consulting's work towards establishing a current mineral resource estimate on the Project. These priority assay results represent the main mineralized zone from the first hole of the program, 25-TVA-001.

Highlights of the Results from hole 25-TVA-001 Include:

23.2 drilled meters (m) of 2.22 % Antimony (Sb) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m

Including: 7.9m of 4.9% Sb over a true width of 6.8m from 152.7m to 160.6m

23.2m of 1.27 g/t Gold (Au) over a true width of 20.1m from 144.3m to 167.5m

Including: 6.2m of 3.17 g/t Au over true width of 5.4m from 160.6m to 166.8m

Scott Eldridge, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, commented, ""We are thrilled by these first results from the Trojarová Antimony Gold Project confirmation drilling campaign. This validation of the quality and continuity of historical results provides crucial confidence as we proceed with the completion of the project's first modern Mineral Resource Estimate which is expected to be completed by SLR Consulting this quarter. We are confirming that Trojarová hosts antimony mineralization consistent with earlier work but now supported by contemporary assays. In the context of Europe's Critical Raw Materials Act, these results underscore Trojarová's potential to become a strategically important antimony project for the European Union at a time when secure, domestic supply of critical minerals has never been more important. Trojarová stands out as the only known antimony project in Europe with extensive historical drilling that can now be supported by modern drilling and assays. This combination significantly enhances the project's strategic relevance as the EU works to secure reliable, home-grown supply of critical minerals.""

The Company is working to complete the logging and sampling of the remaining drill core and to expedite the release of complete assay results as quickly as possible. Further details of the complete drill program will be included in future releases as the campaign's data is verified and finalized including professional location surveys of final drillhole collar locations.

The complete results, (outlined in Table 1 to be viewed in actual press release), show a distinct metal zonation within the main zone. Antimony and gold mineralization are consistently present throughout the main zone with a distinct 7.9m interval of Antimony enrichment from 152.7m to 160.6m immediately overlying a 6.2m interval of gold enrichment between 160.6m and 166.8m. Antimony values in the enriched interval range from 0.76% to 12.8%. Gold values in the enriched interval range from 1.26 g/t to 10.45 g/t.

History of the Project and Historical Resource - Discovered nearly fifty years ago, Trojarová was the focus of extensive surface and underground exploration over 2km of strike length between 1983 and 1995, including 63 diamond drillholes totaling 14,330 meters, and 1.7 kilometers of underground workings. Historical exploration efforts culminated in a historical mineral resource estimate published by the Slovak Geological institute in 1992 (see ""Historical Resource Estimates"" in the press release issued today). Per this historical estimate, at a cut-off grade of 1.0% antimony, Trojarová hosts 2.46 million tonnes averaging 2.47% antimony and 0.635 grams per tonne gold in a mineralized zone averaging 3.32 meters wide, containing approximately 60,000 tonnes of antimony in situ.

The historical estimate at Trojarová was classified using the Slovak version of the newly post-Soviet Russian classification system, which uses categories not directly comparable to modern standards as defined by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy & Petroluem (""CIM"") Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves. The Slovak Geological Institute, the State agency that carried out all exploration and underground development work at Trojarová, classified the resource as ""P1"" in the Slovak version of the Russian classification system. P1 is most comparable in CIM's classification system to ""Inferred Mineral Resources,"" which is defined by the CIM as that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current, and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current. For additional information relating to the historical estimate see below under the heading ""Historical Resource Estimates"".

The Company announced January 8th, 2025, that SLR Consulting had been engaged to complete a modern mineral resource estimate of the Trojarová Project. The current drill program supports this work by seeking to confirm historical results and validate preliminary resource models.

Preliminary modelling of historical data indicates the Trojarová deposit may display a trend of thickening and increasing antimony grades to the NW. The Company has targeted projected extensions of the deposit along this vector with 3 of the 7 planned drillholes with the aim to expand the current extents of the known deposit.

The analysts project 2031 sales of the duo at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.
The once-daily oral treatment is set for a potential launch in 2027 and has the potential to become a “paradigm-changing treatment for B-cell malignancies,” the report notes.
The oral second-generation cereblon E3 ligase modulator could be a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who've previously been treated with immunomodulatory drugs, Clarivate said.
Clarivate also selected Otsuka’s voyxact, which is expected to launch in 2026 and generate $955 million in 2031 sales.","Eli Lilly has dominated headlines in recent months, recently taking the crown as the most valuable company in the biopharma industry by market cap. And the song remains much the same in analytics firm Clarivate's Drugs to Watch 2026 report.

The annual outlook, which identifies (PDF) 11 potential blockbusters and transformative medicines, highlights two cardiometabolic treatments from the Indianapolis company, which have yet to be approved but could ultimately take the place of its current cash cows Mounjaro and Zepbound.

Lilly’s investigational treatments are daily GLP-1 pill orforglipron, which is slated for an FDA decision by March of this year, and triple-action, weekly injection retatrutide, which Clarivate expects will be ready for launch in 2028.

Both assets are under development in obesity, diabetes and a host of other related indications.

The Clarivate analysts project sales of orforglipron will reach a whopping $16 billion in 2031 and that retatrutide will generate revenue of $30 billion in the same year, an astounding figure which includes $10 billion in sales as an obesity treatment and $20 billion as a medicine for diabetes.

Clarivate’s report highlights the continued ascent of the obesity and metabolic disease market, as well as how Lilly has positioned itself to take full advantage. Morgan Stanley projects the overall cardiometabolic medicine market will reach $150 billion by 2035.

“The GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) revolution is entering a new phase of maturation and diversification,” Clarivate wrote. “Orforglipron and retatrutide exemplify the next generation of metabolic therapies: oral formulations that promise improved adherence, triple-hormone mechanisms that deliver superior weight loss and expanded therapeutic applications spanning from brain health to renal disease.”

As for the 2031 sales projections of the drugs on Clarivate’s 2026 list, orforglipron and retatrutide eclipse all others. The remaining medicines Clarivate highlighted have much lower sales projections than Lilly's, with no others expected to surpass the $2-billion threshold in 2031, according to Clarivate’s reckoning.

Johnson & Johnson is the only other company with two drugs named—bladder cancer treatment Inlexzo, which gained FDA approval in September of last year, and immunotherapy icotrokinra, which Clarivate expects will be launched this year. The analysts project 2031 sales of the duo at $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.

Inlexzo made the grade with Clarivate for its bladder-sparing, “paradigm-shifting” drug-releasing system, which allows for extended release of the chemotherapy gemcitabine directly to patients' bladders through an intravesical system that can be placed in minutes in an outpatient setting.

Icotrokinra, meanwhile, is poised to become the first-to-market targeted oral peptide designed to block the interleukin (IL)-23 receptor, which plays a key role in the inflammatory process in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis as well as ulcerative colitis, Clarivate said.

Clarivate also singled out two protein degrader cancer drugs, including BeOne Medicine’s BGB-16673. The once-daily oral treatment is set for a potential launch in 2027 and has the potential to become a “paradigm-changing treatment for B-cell malignancies,” the report notes. The asset could be effective at treating multiple hematological cancers as well, according to the analysts. Clarivate projects the drug's sales at $1.2 billion in 2031.

The other protein degrader on Clarivate's radar is Bristol Myers Squibb’s mezigdomide, which is expected to launch in 2026 and could generate $1.5 billion in 2031. The oral second-generation cereblon E3 ligase modulator could be a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who've previously been treated with immunomodulatory drugs, Clarivate said.

Yet another oncology drug on the list comes in the form of Celcuity’s gedatolisib, which is set up for launch this year and is expected to deliver $1.1 billion in sales in 2031.

Clarivate also selected Otsuka’s voyxact, which is expected to launch in 2026 and generate $955 million in 2031 sales. The first-in-class selective A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) inhibitor could serve as a “high-impact, disease-modifying entrant"" in IgA nephropathy (IgAN), also known as Berger’s disease, the Clarivate team predicts.

The analytics team made another rare disease pick in GSK’s Exdensur, which was approved in December and is expected to generate sales of $510 million in 2031. The monoclonal antibody, which targets IL-5, is the first approved ultra-long-acting biologic with a six-month dosing schedule for severe asthma, providing greater convenience over currently available IL-5 inhibitors that require monthly or bimonthly dosing.

Also on Clarivate’s list are two drugs that recently suffered untimely rejections from the FDA. Sanofi’s multiple sclerosis treatment tolebrutinib is a potential first-in-class, brain-penetrant Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. But its prospects have been dampened by both efficacy and safety concerns raised in an FDA complete response letter (CRL).",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-486691192.jpg?VersionId=D1l6TNpezWwcJX_KqmWnaiIJECgJArJS,N,,2026-01-07 12:01:20.786882

Traders may take a step back from the markets following the advance seen to start the first full trading week of the new year.

However, it is worth noting that the futures were pointing to a roughly flat open on Tuesday before the Dow and the S&P 500 both climbed to new record closing highs over the course of the session.

The futures remained little changed after payroll processor ADP released a report showing private sector employment in the U.S. increased by slightly less than expected in the month of December.

ADP said private sector employment rose by 41,000 jobs in December after falling by a revised 29,000 jobs in November.

Economists had expected private sector employment to climb by 47,000 jobs compared to the loss of 32,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.

""Small establishments recovered from November job losses with positive end-of-year hiring, even as large employers pulled back,"" said ADP chief economist Dr. Nela Richardson.

After turning in a strong performance to kick off the first full trading week of the new year, stocks saw further upside during trading on Tuesday. With the continued upward move, the Dow and the S&P 500 reached new record closing highs.

The major averages ended the day just off their highs of the session. The Dow jumped 484.90 points or 1.0 percent to 49,462.08, the Nasdaq climbed 151.35 points or 0.7 percent to 23,547.17 and the S&P 500 rose 42.77 points or 0.6 percent to 6,944.82.

The Dow benefitted from a sharp increase by shares of Amazon (AMZN), with the online retail giant surging by 3.4 percent.

Amazon jumped to a new record closing high after announcing it is rolling out Alexa.com to Alexa+ Early Access customers in what is seen as an effort to more directly compete with ChatGPT and Gemini.

Strong gains by Amgen (AMZN), Salesforce (CRM) and IBM Corp. (IBM) also contributed to the jump by the blue chip index.

The continued advance by the broader markets came despite a lack of major catalysts, as traders look ahead to the release of several key U.S. economic reports in the coming days.

The highlight of the week is likely to be the release of the Labor Department's closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.

The data could impact the outlook for interest rates ahead of the Federal Reserve's next monetary policy meeting later this month.

While the Fed is likely to leave rates unchanged at its January 27-28 meeting, the central bank is widely expected to cut rates by at least another quarter point in the coming months.

Computer hardware stocks turned in some of the market's best performances on the day, with the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index soaring by 4.3 percent.

A sharp increase by the price of gold also contributed to substantial strength among gold stocks, as reflected by the 4.1 percent surge by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index.

Biotechnology stocks also saw considerable strength on the day, resulting in a 3.0 percent jump by the NSYE Arca Biotechnology Index.

Semiconductor, retail and healthcare stocks also showed notable moves to the upside, while significant weakness was visible among energy stocks amid a pullback by the price of crude oil.

The AI Marketing Cloud provider revealed that the collaboration would utilize OpenAI’s models to power conversational intelligence and agentic functions into the product.

This partnership will further enable Zeta to increase the speed at which it understands the customer market and how its strategies are driving meaningful engagement.

David A. Steinberg, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Zeta Global, explained how this collaboration would allow Zeta to expand its vision for Athena and its role in the enterprise marketing sector.

“AI is moving from the edges of marketing to the center of how enterprises operate, and Athena embodies that shift,” he said.

“It transforms the Zeta Marketing Platform into an intelligent operating system for growth – one that can listen, reason, and act on behalf of marketers.

“Together with OpenAI, we’re making this new way of working easy to adopt and scale, so brands can move faster, spend smarter, and win the moments that matter most.”

By utilizing OpenAI’s models for Athena, this will allow Zeta Global to input more natural conversational responses and decision-ready answers directly into marketing workflows.

Athena is embedded within the Zeta Marketing Platform, meaning that when in use, marketers are not required to switch between analytics tools, dashboards, or reporting systems, allowing analysis and execution to remain connected.

Athena will interpret the data and present possible conclusions that turn raw metrics into summarized insights with clear implications. This allows marketing teams to ask Athena questions on audience responses, email performance, or conversion rates declines, and in return receive actionable insights without needing multiple tools.

Furthermore, Zeta will also be expanding early beta access for its two Athena applications, Insights and Advisor, responding to customer uptake in adoption interest.

So, let’s take a closer look at what customers can expect from these solutions:

Insights with Athena

This application can be used by marketers as a conversational analytics assistant. Marketing teams can ask audience and product performance-related questions, as well as research possible trends and opportunities in plain language to receive instant, insight-heavy results.

Athena utilizes OpenAI’s models to pull relevant data, trends, and insights to generate answers, visualizations, and dashboards.

It can also identify shifts in customer behavior and engagement patterns across multiple channels, eliminating the need for manual database creation or navigating multiple tools for faster, more intuitive insight gathering.

Advisor with Athena

This app functions as an AI marketing strategist, utilizing goal-driven optimization capabilities to review ongoing marketing campaigns, performance metrics, and historical data. From here, it can recommend next steps to adjust targeting, modify creative content, or budget reallocating to improve outcomes.

In limited circumstances, Athena can automatically execute actions in configured accurately, including sending revised campaigns to selected audiences or launching follow-up sequences.

By automating analysis and decision-making, the app can advise marketing teams to act on insights quickly without waiting for manual reports to come in.

Giancarlo ‘GC’ Lionetti, Chief Commercial Officer at OpenAI, emphasizes how this partnership will allow Zeta Global to expand its data analysis capabilities with AI.

“Zeta shows how advanced AI moves beyond insight and into action,” he said.

“By working together, we are bringing agentic intelligence directly into everyday marketing workflows, helping enterprises move faster and act with confidence.”

This trend, to support software-defined vehicles (SDVs) and software-driven mobility (SDM) services, is directly linked to AI and computer vision.

More than eight out of ten organisations believe that software-defined products and services, and not just the physical vehicle, will become their main value proposition. Although the goals are ambitious, less than half of these companies have ramped up their SDM initiatives by 2025: 34% have partially ramped up at least one SDM use case, and only 14% have achieved large-scale implementation.

According to the research, organisations in the automotive sector increasingly recognise the value of broader collaboration, with nearly two in five partnering with large technology companies and hyperscalers to gain critical software, cloud and data capabilities.

AI as a source of innovation

The report highlights that 85% agree that AI is increasingly becoming an integral part of automotive software, directly integrated into software features and functions, from enhancing the in-vehicle experience to enabling advanced safety and cybersecurity features.

77% believe that the integration of AI into software development, in-vehicle features and mobility services is a key competitive advantage that will transform the automotive value chain. By reducing costs, increasing productivity and efficiency, and improving product quality, AI is propelling the industry into a new era of innovation.

Implications of these advances for the near future

Both AI and computer vision implemented in the automotive industry have major safety considerations and a growing demand for autonomous driving.

These advances mean greater safety in both assisted (ADAS) and automated driving, thanks to perception systems that are more accurate, reliable under difficult conditions and capable of reacting in real time. In addition, they are democratising advanced assisted driving; thanks to cheaper and more modular AI vision solutions, technologies that previously only existed in high-end ranges could reach more popular cars.

On the other hand, with software-defined vehicles (SDVs), vehicles will no longer be a ‘sum of independent parts’ but will become unified software platforms, facilitating updates, new features, customisation and remote maintenance. We also find that, with advances in 3D perception, sensor fusion, robustness in adverse conditions, and AI control systems, computer vision is laying the foundation for higher-level autonomous cars, especially in controlled environments.

Not only that, but new implications are also emerging in the industry with greater automation in production and quality control, which can translate into safer, more consistent vehicles and more efficient and sustainable manufacturing.

Recent major advances

Stradvision, which specialises in advanced 3D vision for ADAS and autonomous driving,

has been recognised in 2025 as a ‘Top SME Innovator’ by CLEPA, thanks to its AI-based perception technology, SVNet 3D Perception Network. This system allows for high-fidelity 3D understanding of the vehicle's environment, even under difficult conditions (low light, adverse weather).

With SVNet, manufacturers can offer driver assistance and partial/more advanced automation features at a lower cost, bringing 3D ADAS to more vehicle ranges. SVNet is designed to deliver higher fidelity spatial understanding, robust real-time object classification, and improved performance in low light and adverse weather conditions, enabling next-generation autonomous driving platforms. The technology is optimised to offer deployment flexibility across multiple SoCs and vehicle segments.

In addition, CES 2025 showcased its integration with the Texas Instruments TDA4VPE-Q1 automotive chip, optimised for Level 2/2+ ADAS (advanced assistance, automatic parking, 3D perimeter vision, etc.). This means that technologies previously reserved for expensive vehicles can now be implemented in a scalable manner.

AI-powered driver and occupant monitoring

Seeing Machines' DMS and OMS technology can be found integrated into a number of demonstrations from leading customers and partners, who will also be present at CES. This includes the company's Guardian Generation 3 software, which will be showcased at Ambarella's invitation-only exhibition. Seeing Machines' next-generation driver safety solution leverages Ambarella's CV25 AI SoC to deliver industry-leading AI performance per watt, enabling the company to improve Guardian's overall performance for commercial vehicles while enhancing global road safety and helping its customers comply with new regulations, including those currently in force in Europe.

In collaboration with QNX, Seeing Machines is integrating its QNX Cabin interior sensing technology, where the company's advanced algorithms will be leveraged to enable OEMs to monitor driver drowsiness and distraction, mitigating the risks associated with unsafe driving and enabling compliance with international safety regulations.

New SDV architectures and centralisation of intelligence

Visteon has launched its cognitoAI tool which, unlike other cloud-based AI systems for cars, resides directly in the vehicle. This system processes everything locally to deliver ultra-fast responses; continuously analyses vehicle data to provide useful information about the vehicle's condition and performance; learns and adapts to your driving habits over time; integrates data from multiple vehicle systems to make smarter decisions; and enables state-of-the-art voice interactions without the need for an internet connection.

This new platform manages multiple critical functions simultaneously. Think of it as the car's brain, managing advanced driver assistance with enhanced visualisation, high-fidelity 3D controls for vehicle functions, augmented reality navigation, AI-powered driver monitoring and Android-based entertainment systems. And it does all this while maintaining maximum performance and reliability.

Visteon is making vehicle interaction more enjoyable thanks to three key innovations: curved OLED displays: crisp information that adapts to the natural contours of the car; active privacy features: keeping confidential information visible only to those who need to see it, to avoid distractions; Deco Trim: controls hidden within decorative surfaces; no cluttered dashboards.

Toolchain

Continental's Road to Cloud Ecosystem approach to SDVs provides a comprehensive toolchain to simplify and accelerate vehicle software development. With the electrical backbone of SDVs, users will see the interaction and connection of hardware enablers, while the Continental Automotive Edge Framework and virtualisation highlight the developer workbench, cloud solutions and seamless integration into high-performance computers (HPC) and zone control units.

Other software solutions for future mobility, such as Cabin Sensing, Holistic Motion Control, Radar Vision Parking and Smart Device-based Vehicle Access, further expand the capabilities of SDV. The range of possibilities for SDV is unveiled with Continental's Intelligent Vehicle Experience, a smart vehicle that senses its surroundings, anticipates user intentions and interacts with the user. Sensors in existing vehicles, combined with artificial intelligence algorithms, offer a system solution for the new SDV architecture and provide a highly personalised user experience.

Serving production and business

At the Bosch Tech Day at the end of October, the company showcased artificial intelligence (AI) as a lever for industrial and social transformation. The firm has been implementing AI in its factories for decades to speed up production, optimise processes and reduce errors. A clear example was the automation of state-of-the-art sensor lines, where algorithms replaced repetitive tasks previously performed by operators, allowing them to focus on higher value-added functions.

They explained the difference between weak and strong AI and the role of generative AI in creating synthetic data, which is essential for training algorithms in environments with few real failures. They also highlighted how Bosch applies AI in predictive maintenance, automatic processing robots and alert classification, improving efficiency and safety in factories and vehicles.

In terms of human talent, it was noted that digitalisation generates new job opportunities: data scientists and engineers, profiles with training in physics and mathematics, and experts in technological ethics who previously had no clear prospects in the job market now find a place in the digitalised industry. Collaboration with universities, start-ups and technology consortia was also highlighted as a key element in accelerating innovation.

Volkswagen and productive AI

In preparation for vehicle production for a future driven by artificial intelligence, Volkswagen and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have extended their collaboration on the Digital Production Platform (DPP), Volkswagen's “factory cloud” designed to support car manufacturing, for another five years.

Volkswagen uses the DPP to implement cutting-edge AI and IT systems across all its global production plants. This makes production more flexible and faster, reduces IT costs, and helps bring new models to market more quickly.

Originally launched as a network of industrial partners, Volkswagen and AWS have turned the DPP into a key digital link that helps connect order intake, logistics, and manufacturing, helping to ensure a seamless flow of data throughout the entire process chain. This is a fundamental prerequisite for the widespread use of AI, one of the company's key strategic goals. In addition, the DPP helps Volkswagen implement new IT systems as standardised solutions across all its factories.

Across the Volkswagen Group, 43 plants in Europe, North America and South America are already connected to the DPP. In total, the Volkswagen Group operates 114 production plants worldwide.

The high availability and scalability of AWS help Volkswagen host these production-critical systems in the cloud and contribute to reducing the risk of production line downtime. Thanks to greater standardisation of systems across all plants, the Volkswagen Group is already achieving medium-term savings in the tens of millions. At the same time, these standards help to create a unified, multifunctional database – enabling even more consistent use of technologies such as AI. For example, with ‘KI4UPS’, Volkswagen leverages AI to assist assembly line teams in implementing vehicle software, identifying potential electronic problems more quickly. This contributes to a substantial reduction in Volkswagen's manual workload.

The Volkswagen Group currently uses more than 1,200 AI applications – far beyond the realm of production. Through innovative AWS services such as Amazon SageMaker, Volkswagen trains AI models and creates industrial computer vision use cases that improve quality control systems and reduce costs. These AI applications include sustainability initiatives: at the Poznań plant in Poland, for example, AI is used to help optimise electricity consumption. As a result, energy costs have been reduced by 12%, along with a decrease in CO₂ emissions.

Key AI trends in the automotive industry

Several AI-driven trends have been transforming development and operations throughout 2025.

Predictive thermal control in electric vehicle propulsion systems

When discussing optimising the propulsion system of an electric vehicle, it is useful to first analyse what that system actually consists of. Essentially, it involves electric motors, batteries and a set of power electronics components — including on-board chargers, DC-DC or AC-DC converters and controllers — that work together to deliver power efficiently and reliably.

AI is already accelerating innovation in batteries, but it is also driving advances in these other components. For example, in electric motor design, AI is increasingly being used in material selection, simulation, and multivariable modelling to increase power, reduce weight, and improve overall efficiency. These optimisations directly translate into better performance and lower energy consumption.

Another significant development is the transition from 400-volt to 800-volt architectures. Early generations of BEVs typically used 400-volt motors and supporting electronics. Now, with the rapid advancement of technology, many original equipment manufacturers, especially in China, are migrating to 800 V systems, which enable significantly faster charging thanks to their ability to handle high-voltage current flows with capable power electronics, improved thermal performance, and greater overall efficiency.

Achieving these improvements requires compatible power electronics and motor designs, areas where AI-based design and validation tools are proving indispensable.

With accelerated battery design using AI-enabled platforms, AI algorithms and artificial intelligence applied to automotive are transforming battery development from start to finish. Engineers are using AI to improve thermal management and prevent risks such as overheating, which can lead to fires.

Machine learning models also guide the selection and optimisation of cell chemistry, striking a balance between fast charging capability and long-term durability. This allows batteries to accept high-voltage currents without accelerating chemical degradation.

In addition, AI is helping to increase energy density, enabling greater range without adding weight, and refining recharge cycles so that batteries last longer. These advances not only affect performance, but also shorten R&D cycles and reduce development costs.

In markets such as China, where new-generation electric vehicle manufacturers are leveraging AI to launch new products at a rapid pace, established vehicle manufacturers are being forced to accelerate their own innovation cycles. In markets such as China, where new-generation electric vehicle manufacturers are leveraging AI to launch new products at a rapid pace, established vehicle manufacturers are being forced to accelerate their own innovation cycles.

While battery design and development remain critical, the impact of AI goes beyond that. It is shaping the entire battery ecosystem. AI optimises supply chains for critical materials such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.

It also increases manufacturing efficiency by reducing production waste. In addition, AI improves recycling to recover valuable materials when electric vehicle batteries reach the end of their useful life. These applications highlight the broad potential of AI to make batteries more sustainable, cost-effective and resilient.

In factories and vehicle systems, AI enables rapid scenario testing. Incorporating digital twins into R&D processes enables early-stage validation, with layered data feedback loops that reduce downtime and development costs. Analysts can triangulate efficiency differences between original equipment manufacturers using these methods. By aligning design and manufacturing with these new paradigms, companies can systematically reduce time to market and support data-intensive product lines.

Según el informe “La era de la movilidad impulsada por el software: más allá de los vehículos”, del Instituto de Investigación de Capgemini, el 92% de las organizaciones del sector de la automoción prevén una transformación en empresas de software. Esta tendencia, para dar soporte a los vehículos definidos por software (SDV) y a los servicios de movilidad impulsados por software (SDM), está directamente entroncada con la IA y la visión artificial.

Como nos explica Johan Huss, Vice President Digital Products and Services en Sandvik Coromant, el futuro está en los modelos de negocio que eliminan la complejidad de la planta de producción y vinculan los costes directamente al rendimiento.

En virtud de la norma FMVSS 127, la Administración Nacional de Seguridad Vial en Carreteras de Estados Unidos (NHTSA) exige que, a partir del 1 de septiembre de 2029, todos los turismos y camiones ligeros nuevos vendidos en los Estados Unidos estén equipados con sistemas de alerta de colisión frontal (FCW) y de frenado automático de emergencia (AEB).

Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna have been embroiled in lawsuits with several other companies claiming infringement of mRNA technology.
Five months ago, GSK collected $320 million in a settlement with Pfizer and BioNTech that also involved German vaccine specialist CureVac.","Bayer has filed separate lawsuits against the creators of three COVID-19 vaccines, claiming they violated intellectual property developed by Monsanto, the crop science company the German company acquired a decade ago.

In federal district court in Delaware, Bayer filed one complaint against Moderna and another against partners Pfizer and BioNTech. In U.S. district court in New Jersey, Bayer also is suing Johnson & Johnson.

The lawsuits allege that the defendants used Bayer’s technology in creating their vaccines “to eliminate ‘problem’ coding sequences in the building blocks of cells to improve mRNA stability and the amount or quality of protein produced.”

Pfizer and J&J did not respond to a request for comment. Moderna and BioNTech responded but only to say they were aware of the litigation.

Monsanto filed to protect its intellectual property in 1989, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office eventually granted it in 2010, according to the lawsuits. Bayer bought out Monsanto for $66 billion in 2016.

Monsanto initially used the technology to increase the expression of an insect-resistant protein in crops, which reduced the need for pesticide sprays and improved agricultural output, the lawsuits explained.

Instability leading to poor protein expression was a central issue the COVID-19 vaccine makers faced in developing their shots. Solving this helped enhance the vaccines' “ability to confer immunity to the virus,” Bayer wrote in its complaint against Pfizer/BioNTech, adding that the German biotech has “acknowledged that it utilizes codon optimization in its mRNA products.”

While J&J’s COVID shot—which is no longer available—was a traditional viral vector vaccine, it still needed increased mRNA stability for protein expression, according to Bayer.

Bayer is requesting a jury trial and is seeking a cut of the proceeds generated by the vaccines and royalties on future sales. In the case of Pfizer and BioNTech, Bayer said the companies reported more than $93 billion in sales of their vaccine Comirnaty.

Third Quarter of Fiscal 2025 Results

Net sales and other revenue increased 1.9% to $19,123.7 million for the 12 weeks ended November 29, 2025 (""third quarter of fiscal 2025"") from $18,774.5 million during the 12 weeks ended November 30, 2024 (""third quarter of fiscal 2024""). This increase was driven by a 2.4% increase in identical sales, with strong growth in pharmacy sales being the primary driver of the identical sales increase. We also continued to grow our digital sales with a 21% increase during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. These increases in Net sales and other revenue were partially offset by a net reduction in sales driven by store closures since the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and lower fuel sales. In addition, we estimate the temporary government shutdown and related delayed SNAP funding during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 negatively impacted identical sales by approximately 10 to 20 basis points.

Gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 27.9% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of fuel and LIFO expense, gross margin rate decreased 55 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This decrease in gross margin rate was driven by increases in delivery and handling costs related to the continued growth in our digital sales, and strong growth in pharmacy sales, which carries an overall lower gross margin rate. We also continue to make incremental investments in our customer value proposition which were funded by the benefits from our productivity initiatives.

Selling and administrative expenses decreased to 24.9% of Net sales and other revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 25.1% during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue decreased 33 basis points. This decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to the sales leveraging of employee costs and lower merger-related costs, partially offset by an increase in business transformation costs. The benefits from our productivity initiatives continue to partially offset increasing wage rates and other inflationary pressures on our operating expenses.

Net gain on property dispositions and impairment losses was $1.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to net loss of $10.2 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Interest expense, net was $116.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $109.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Other income, net was $4.0 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $5.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Income tax expense was $84.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, representing a 22.3% effective tax rate, compared to $14.5 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, representing a 3.5% effective tax rate. The increase in the effective rate was primarily driven by the recognition of $81.0 million of discrete state income tax benefits related to the settlement of audits during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Net income was $293.3 million, or $0.55 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $400.6 million, or $0.69 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 included the $81.0 million or $0.14 per share benefit related to certain discrete state income tax benefits related to the settlement of audits.

Adjusted net income was $390.3 million, or $0.72 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to $420.3 million, or $0.71 per share, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,038.7 million, or 5.4% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $1,065.1 million, or 5.7% of Net sales and other revenue, during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Capital Allocation and Common Stock Repurchase Program

During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, capital expenditures were $1,412.8 million, which primarily included the completion of 74 remodels, the opening of five new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company paid its quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on November 7, 2025 to stockholders of record as of October 24, 2025. On January 7, 2026, the Company announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share to be paid on February 6, 2026 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 23, 2026.

On October 14, 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan"") to repurchase $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock. Also on October 14, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion, inclusive of the ASR Agreement. On October 15, 2025, the Company paid JPMorgan $750.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 35.4 million shares of common stock with a value equal to $600.0 million as of the date the ASR Agreement was executed, representing an estimated 80% of the total shares initially underlying the ASR Agreement. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock on specified dates during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, inclusive of the $750.0 million ASR Agreement, the Company invested $1,361.6 million for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the existing multi-year $2.75 billion repurchase authorization.

On November 10, 2025, the Company completed the issuance of $700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2031 (the ""2031 Notes"") and $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% senior unsecured notes due March 31, 2034 (the ""2034 Notes"" and together with the 2031 Notes, the ""Notes""). Proceeds from the Notes were used to redeem in full the $750.0 million outstanding of the Company's 3.250% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2026 (the ""Redemption""), to repay a portion of the borrowings under the ABL Facility, and to pay fees and expenses related to the Redemption and the issuance of the Notes.

Fiscal 2025 Outlook

Non-GAAP Measures and Identical Sales

Non-GAAP Measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per Class A common share and Net debt ratio (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin, and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt ratio for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Identical Sales. As used in this earnings release, the term ""identical sales"" includes stores operating during the same period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year, comparing sales on a daily basis.

Investing.com -- Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE: ACI) reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, while revenue came in slightly below estimates as the grocery chain continues to invest in digital growth and technology.

The supermarket operator posted adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share for the quarter ended November 29, beating the analyst consensus of $0.68. Revenue reached $19.12 billion, up 1.9% from the same period last year but falling short of the $19.18 billion analysts had expected. Identical store sales increased 2.4% YoY, driven primarily by strong pharmacy sales growth.

Shares of Albertsons dipped 0.5% following the earnings announcement.

""In the third quarter, we delivered solid results and continued to advance our strategic priorities,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer. ""Our investments in technology and AI are fundamentally reshaping how we operate and serve our customers; driving smarter decisions, greater efficiency, and more personalized experiences.""

Digital sales surged 21% during the quarter, while loyalty membership grew 12% to 49.8 million members. The company noted that the temporary government shutdown and related delayed SNAP funding negatively impacted identical sales by approximately 10 to 20 basis points during the quarter.

Gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% from 27.9% in the prior year period, primarily due to increased delivery and handling costs related to digital sales growth and the expansion of lower-margin pharmacy sales.

For fiscal 2025, Albertsons narrowed its identical sales growth forecast to between 2.2% and 2.5%, down from its previous guidance of 2.2% to 2.75%, partly due to the impact of Medicare’s Drug Price Negotiation Program. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.08 to $2.16, compared to the analyst consensus of $2.14.

Financial Highlights

Net sales and other revenue increased by 1.9% to $19.1 billion, driven by a 2.4% increase in identical sales and a 21% growth in digital sales.

The company also reported a 12% increase in loyalty members, reaching 49.8 million. However, the gross margin rate decreased to 27.4% from 27.9% in the previous year, primarily due to higher delivery and handling costs associated with digital sales and lower-margin pharmacy sales.

“This 2025 holiday season, consumers embraced generative AI more than ever as a shopping assistant in their purchasing decisions,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights.","Record holiday season online, propelled by a strong Cyber Week

Consumers spent $257.8 billion online from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, up 6.8% year-over-year (YoY) and setting a new record for e-commerce. 25 days saw consumers spend more than $4 billion in a single day (a significant jump from 18 days in 2024). Mobile shopping hit a new milestone, with the majority of online transactions (56.4%) taking place through a smartphone this season (up from 54.5% in 2024); Mobile shopping was highest on Christmas Day (Dec. 25), driving 66.5% of online sales (vs. 65% in 2024), followed by Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 27) at 61.6% mobile share (vs. 59.3% in 2024).

Record online spending this season was bolstered by a strong Cyber Week (the five days from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday), which brought in $44.2 billion online overall, up 7.7% YoY. Cyber Monday remained the biggest e-commerce day of the season (and year), driving $14.25 billion in online spend, up 7.1% YoY. Cyber Monday growth was outpaced by Black Friday ($11.8 billion, up 9.1% YoY), as consumers embraced earlier deals. On Thanksgiving Day, consumers spent $6.4 billion online, up 5.3% YoY.

Competitive discounts pushed consumers to ‘trade up’

Strong discounts this season drove resilient consumer demand online. Shoppers found great deals in electronics, where discounts peaked at 30.9% off listed price (vs. 30.1% in 2024), as well as toys at 29.6% (vs. 28%), apparel at 25.1% (vs. 23.2%), televisions at 24.3% (vs. 24.2%), computers at 23.4% (vs. 22.8%), sporting goods at 20.3% (vs. 19.5%), appliances at 20.2% (vs. 19.2%) and furniture at 18.8% (vs. 19%).

Deals this season also drove consumers to purchase higher-ticket items in categories such as electronics, sporting goods and appliances—propelling e-commerce growth as a result. This season, the share-of-units-sold for the most expensive goods increased by 20% compared to the rest of the year. Within categories, this figure was up 56% in electronics, 55% in sporting goods, 38% in appliances, 34% in personal care products and 29% in tools.

Generative AI reshaped the online shopping journey

Generative AI-powered chat services and browsers have become an integral tool for consumers to find deals and research products. This season, traffic to retail sites from generative AI tools (shoppers clicking on a link to a retail site) increased by 693.4% compared to the year prior. On Cyber Monday, AI traffic to U.S. retail sites increased by 670%. While the base of users remains modest, the uptick shows the value AI can deliver as a shopping assistant. These services were used most in categories including video games, toys, appliances, electronics and personal care products.

“This 2025 holiday season, consumers embraced generative AI more than ever as a shopping assistant in their purchasing decisions,” said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst, Adobe Digital Insights. “Competitive discounts and flexible payment options like Buy Now Pay Later also contributed to driving record spend of $257.8 billion throughout this holiday season.”

GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ: GTLB) was downgraded to Neutral from Overweight at Cantor Fitzgerald, which slashed the target price on the shares to $40 from $60.","Pre-Market Stock Futures:

The futures are trading flat on Wednesday after a second strong day for Wall Street, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit another record high, closing over $49,000 for the first time at $49,484, up a solid 1.04%. The S&P 500 also posted a record high, closing at 6,947, up 0.66%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also scored a win on Tuesday, closing the day at 23,546, up 0.64%. Continued momentum from Monday carried stocks higher, plus solid economic news on multiple fronts also added to the bullish sentiment. Semiconductor stocks are still leading the technology charge, and many feel the top companies could post outstanding fourth-quarter earnings, which will start next week with the big money-center banks reporting. Plus, after hitting a wall at the end of 2025, AI and data center stocks have shown renewed momentum as investors chase more big gains in 2026.

Treasury Bonds:

Yields were mixed across the Treasury curve after a solid start to the week on Monday. While buying was seen in the shorter T-bill maturities, there was some modest selling across the middle and longer maturities. Investors are clearly focused on upcoming economic data and geopolitical events, such as developments in Venezuela. However, recent market shifts saw yields dip amid broader Fed uncertainty and tech bubble fears, creating a volatile environment for safe-haven assets. The 30-year long bond was last seen Tuesday at 4.85% while the benchmark ten-year note finished the day at 4.17%

Oil and Gas:

After a solid Monday, stocks were down across the energy complex, and some of the same worries from 2025 resurfaced on Tuesday as expectations of a global supply surplus in 2026 and the lack of immediate supply disruption from geopolitical tensions in Venezuela, as Chevron reported that it will keep Venezuelan oil flowing despite the political upheaval there. Traders are focused on market fundamentals, which point to ample supply and subdued demand concerns. Brent Crude closed at $60.49, down 2.06%, while West Texas Intermediate was last seen at $56.91, down 2.42%. Natural gas also saw sellers reappear, as unseasonably warm weather in many parts of the country was a factor. Nat gas closed at $3.40, down 3.43%.

Gold:

Gold and Silver continued their respective marches higher, albeit not as dramatically for Gold as some of the trading days we have seen recently, when both precious metals would bolt higher by 5-10% and more. The song remains the same as central bank buying, massive retail inflows, and geopolitical concerns continue to drive investors to chase both Gold and Silver. Gold closed the session up almost 1% at $4,492. However, Silver continued a hot streak, closing up 6.06% at $81.18.

Crypto:

Crypto markets traded mixed on Tuesday as investors remained cautious ahead of key macroeconomic data releases. Bitcoin pulled back slightly but generally held above the $91,000 to $92,000 range, while some altcoins like XRP and Solana posted notable gains. Many crypto analysts on Wall Street are starting to signal they feel the bottom after a sizable sell-off that began last year may be in the process of being put in. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $91,940, while Ethereum was trading at $3,212.

24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders. Some of these daily analyst calls cover stocks to buy. Other calls cover stocks to sell or avoid. Remember that no single analyst call should ever be used as a basis to buy or sell a stock.

Here are some of the top Wall Street analyst upgrades, downgrades, and initiations seen on Wednesday, January 7, 2026.

Upgrades:

Amcor plc (NYSE: AMCR) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Baird with a $10 target price.

Block Inc. (NYSE: XYZ) was upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at BNP Paribas with an $82 price target.

Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL) was upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sandler, which bumped the target price for the stock to $88 from $82.

McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE: MCD) was raised to Outperform from Perform at Oppenheimer with a $355 target price.

Downgrades:

Bank of America Inc. (NYSE: BAC) was downgraded to Peer Perform from Outperform at Wolfe Research with a $58 target price.

Market consolidation limits risk-taking, creating space for independent brands to lead meaningful change.

Specialty coffee roasters can drive real innovation by partnering with producers, collaborating beyond coffee, and developing value-led products.

Successful innovation strengthens financial resilience and supports the wider supply chain.

When specialty coffee first emerged, it redefined how coffee was grown, traded, and consumed. Quality and traceability became the differentiators, demonstrating how value commanded higher prices.

For a long time, these factors alone were enough for specialty coffee roasters. But today’s challenging market requires them to continue innovating.

At the same time, consolidation is reshaping the industry. In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper agreed to buy JDE Peet’s in a US$18bn deal. This will create the world’s second-largest coffee company, behind Nestlé, and shape the global coffee sector for years to come.

However, innovation thrives on risk, and consolidation at this level makes key players risk-averse. For specialty coffee roasters, this is an opportunity to push for genuine change that strengthens business resilience, exceeds consumer expectations, and supports the overall supply chain.

There are many ways for specialty coffee roasters to drive real innovation: mutually beneficial partnerships with producers, collaborations with brands outside the coffee industry, or the pioneering of new brewing techniques. Regardless of which direction they take, it needs to feel authentic, fresh, and relevant.

Specialty coffee roasters need to maintain momentum

Specialty coffee thrives on innovation, and we have seen plenty over the last two decades.

Flat whites, which became a status symbol in the 2000s for those “in the know” about specialty coffee culture, redefined traditional milk-based drinks. Brewing methods and experimental processing have also proliferated, creating unique flavour experiences. Specialty-grade capsules and instant coffee gained traction in the 2010s, offering both convenience and quality. The cold RTD coffee revolution is arguably still underway, introducing Gen Z consumers to higher-quality options.

Even with higher coffee prices, rising operational costs, and intensifying competition, roasters still need to maintain this momentum.

“Innovation matters because taste alone is too fragile a differentiator,” says Michael Cleland, the co-founder of Assembly Coffee in London, UK. “Quality has become baseline, and the whole industry is selling ‘specialty-grade ethical coffee’ in a market that’s struggling to sustain value.”

One way Assembly drives innovation is by collaborating with producers and research organisations to overcome challenges at origin and deepen understanding of coffee processing. In early 2025, the roaster partnered with Brazilian farm Mió and the Coffee Sensorium to utilise controlled fermentation to increase the quality of overripe cherries.

The result was a limited-edition drop of three coffees processed using three methods: carbonic maceration, yeast fermentation, and “volcanic” fermentation. Overripe coffee is typically discarded due to flavour and quality degradation, so the project allowed consumers to experience flavours that might otherwise be unattainable. Mió, meanwhile, addressed a climate-change-driven problem: rising temperatures are placing coffee plants under severe stress.

“Real innovation meets or exceeds expectations while increasing margin, and this gives businesses the resilience they need while everything else becomes harder,” Michael says. “Without this, they risk competing only on price, and a race to the bottom is a quick way to lose.”

But innovation has many definitions

Innovation conjures up images of unconventional processing techniques, hyper-minimalist packaging, and creative signature drinks. But not all roasters define it in the same way.

“I don’t see innovation as a primary ambition for us,” says Ian Bailey, the founder of Vivid Coffee in Burlington, Vermont, US. “We want to be known as an authentic expression of our values rather than as a brand that is always on the cutting edge.”

For Vivid, real change lies in translating values into tangible products. This begins with building direct sourcing relationships with producers that pay higher prices for exceptional quality.

“In many ways, it requires innovation to communicate these values authentically,” Ian says. “For us, it’s less about chasing trends and more about pursuing authenticity in our values and sourcing practices.”

This highlights a key tension within specialty coffee: how roasters can adapt to changing consumer behaviour while staying true to the ethical and quality-driven principles that define the sector.

Could coffee innovation return to its roots?

Consumer preferences are shifting, particularly among younger generations. Matcha drinks and customised beverages are growing in popularity, often at the expense of traditional black coffee. Research indicates that around 75% of younger consumers regularly add flavours to their drinks.

In response, some specialty coffee roasters are developing blends optimised for milk, sweeteners, and cold coffee, while others are creating in-house syrups and seasonal drinks. Cafés are experimenting with flavours such as corn cold foam and black sesame vanilla, inspired mainly by East Asian cuisine, to appeal to younger demographics without abandoning quality principles.

But instead, there could be potential to refocus on the drink that kickstarted the third wave coffee revolution: black filter coffee.

“Black filter coffee represents essence. It’s a longer drink that helps us perceive the full spectrum of flavours,” says Cosimo Libardo, the head of sales at equipment manufacturer Ceado. “In fact, it’s the beverage that best allows us to understand coffee’s complexity, much like a glass of red wine.

“It is the most critical opportunity to build education and culture. Yet it has been taken for granted,” he adds. “We need to bring it back to the centre stage, as the key to understanding and appreciating coffee.”

Ceado designed its radial infusion Hoop brewer to make filter coffee more accessible. Users add ground coffee to the Flow Tower and pour water into the Outer Loop to assist with more even extraction. For younger, more convenience-focused consumers, low-effort, high-yield brewing is more appealing than intricate multi-step pours.

Roasters can use this opportunity to simultaneously drive innovation and build black coffee’s appeal among Gen Z. Brands like Counter Culture, Onyx Coffee Lab, Klatch, and Black & White are partnering with companies such as Cometeer and xBloom to offer flash-frozen capsules and whole bean pods that simplify high-quality brewing.

Encouraging a shift to “tradition”

Price sensitivity may encourage more people to resume drinking black coffee, but roasters can find other ways to innovate and drive consumption.

“The truth is, it’s hard to make black coffee ‘Instagram special’. You can’t post the taste, so the real work has to go deeper,” says Vytautas Kratulis, the founder of Huracán Coffee, Lithuania’s first specialty coffee roastery.

Huracán collaborates with brands outside the coffee industry, including bean-to-bar chocolate companies, a distillery, and an ice cream manufacturer, demonstrating how diversification can strengthen business resilience, diversify revenue, and drive innovation.

The company recently received Gold and Bronze medals for its filter coffee at the European edition of the Global Coffee Awards.

“You educate, but sometimes it’s an invitation. You create an environment where drinking black coffee feels grown-up, confident, even exalted,” he adds. “A student might order it because they want to embody a more mature image, and batch brew is cheaper than customised drinks.”

A focus on black coffee’s health benefits could prove promising for stressed-out Gen Z, who increasingly prioritise their mental wellbeing.

Innovation in specialty coffee has no single definition. For some roasters, it means new products or formats. For others, it means refining sourcing models, improving sustainability, or strengthening storytelling.

What remains clear is that the future of specialty coffee depends on balance. Roasters must continue to honour the values that shaped the sector while finding new ways to remain relevant in an increasingly competitive and consolidated market. Those who succeed will be the ones who innovate with intention.

​Regulation and risks for “digital cash” Regulation is starting to catch up with this shift.","Stablecoins are shifting from a crypto native tool to a core piece of institutional market plumbing, according to a new cross-sector outlook report from Moody’s.

In the report, published Monday, the ratings agency said stablecoins processed about 87% more settlement volume in 2025 than the year before, reaching $9 trillion in activity based on industry estimates of onchain transactions, rather than purely bank‑to‑bank flows.

Moody’s said fiat‑backed stablecoins and tokenized deposits are evolving into “digital cash” for liquidity management, collateral movements and settlements across an increasingly tokenized financial system.

Stablecoins plug into institutional rails

Moody’s placed stablecoins alongside tokenized bonds, funds and credit products as part of a broader convergence between traditional and digital finance.

Banks, asset managers and market infrastructure providers spent 2025 running pilots on blockchain settlement networks, tokenization platforms and digital custody, seeking to streamline issuance, post‑trade processes and intraday liquidity management.

The report estimated that, across these initiatives, more than $300 billion could be invested in digital finance and infrastructure by 2030 as firms build out the rails for large‑scale tokenization and programmable settlement.

​Within that picture, stablecoins and tokenized deposits increasingly act as the settlement asset for cross‑border payments, repo (short-term secured loans where one party sells securities and agrees to buy them back later at a higher price) and collateral transfers.

Moody’s noted that regulated institutions used cash and US Treasury‑backed stablecoins in 2025 to facilitate intraday movements between funds, credit pools and trading venues, with trials in banks such as Citigroup and Société Générale, among others.

JPM Coin is cited as an example of a deposit token model that integrates programmable payments and liquidity management into existing banking infrastructure, illustrating how “digital cash” layers can sit on top of traditional core systems.

​Regulation and risks for “digital cash”

Regulation is starting to catch up with this shift. The report highlighted the European Union’s Markets in Crypto‑Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework, US stablecoin and market structure proposals and licensing frameworks in Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates as evidence of a converging global approach to tokenization, custody and redemption rules.

In Europe, Société Générale‑Forge’s EURCV and related initiatives are cited as examples of bank-issued products developed under the EU’s emerging stablecoin framework, while in the Gulf, banks and regulators are exploring UAE dirham‑referenced payment tokens and broader digital money architectures.

​Still, Moody’s stressed that the transformation is far from risk‑free. As more value moves onto “digital rails,” the report warned that smart contract bugs, oracle failures, cyberattacks on custody systems and fragmentation across multiple blockchains could create new forms of operational and counterparty risk.

The agency argued that security, interoperability and governance will be just as important as regulatory clarity if stablecoins are to function as reliable institutional settlement assets rather than new sources of systemic vulnerability.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 11:14:10.182838

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Delta Air Lines Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation. Let us introduce you to Narratives, which are simple stories you build around a company that connect your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and then to a fair value that you can compare with the current share price to help decide whether it looks more like a buy, hold or sell for you.

On Simply Wall St’s Community page, used by millions of investors, each Narrative turns your assumptions into a living model that automatically refreshes as new information such as earnings, news or guidance comes through. This means your fair value view is not frozen at the moment you first ran the numbers.

For Delta Air Lines, for example, one published Narrative currently points to a fair value of about US$49 per share, while another points to about US$74.61. This shows how two investors can look at exactly the same company and, based on different expectations for revenue growth, profit margins, discount rates and future P/E, arrive at quite different fair values that the platform then sets against the market price so you can see how your story lines up with what the market is paying today.

For Delta Air Lines, however, we will make it really easy for you with previews of two leading Delta Air Lines Narratives:

These sit side by side, use different assumptions, and show you how reasonable investors can look at the same stock and land in different places on value and risk.

🐂 Delta Air Lines Bull Case

Fair value in this narrative: US$74.61 per share

Gap to that fair value at the current US$72.22 price: about 3.2% below the narrative fair value

Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 3.92% a year

Focuses on premium cabins, loyalty revenue and international routes as the key earnings drivers, with a long term maintenance deal adding another revenue stream.

Assumes modest revenue growth and slightly lower profit margins over time, with earnings reaching about US$4.6b and a future P/E of 12.9x by 2028.

Ties the analyst consensus price target of US$67.81 to these earnings and valuation assumptions, while highlighting risks from tariffs, softer domestic travel and pressure from low cost competitors.

🐻 Delta Air Lines Bear Case

Fair value in this narrative: US$59.84 per share

Gap to that fair value at the current US$72.22 price: about 20.6% above the narrative fair value

Revenue growth assumption in this narrative: 3.5% a year

Frames Delta as a quality operator with strong yield and cost control, but questions how much investors should pay given thin margins and sector shocks that can hit demand and balance sheets.

Flags tariffs, trade tensions and softer travel appetite as key threats for both transatlantic and domestic routes, even for a carrier that currently leads US peers.

Uses a lower future P/E multiple of 10x to reflect these risks, which pulls fair value below the current share price despite recognising solid recent profitability and debt reduction.

Taken together, these Narratives give you a compact range of fair values and the assumptions behind them so you can decide which story, if either, lines up best with your own view on Delta Air Lines.

Excluding the impact of fuel, Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue decreased 33 basis points. This decrease in Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales and other revenue was primarily attributable to the sales leveraging of employee costs and lower merger-related costs, partially offset by an increase in business transformation costs. The benefits from our productivity initiatives continue to partially offset increasing wage rates and other inflationary pressures on our operating expenses.

Capital Allocation and Common Stock Repurchase Program

During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, capital expenditures were $1,412.8 million, which primarily included the completion of 74 remodels, the opening of five new stores and continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company paid its quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share on November 7, 2025 to stockholders of record as of October 24, 2025. On January 7, 2026, the Company announced the next quarterly dividend payment of $0.15 per share to be paid on February 6, 2026 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 23, 2026.

On October 14, 2025, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ""ASR Agreement"") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (""JPMorgan"") to repurchase $750 million of shares of the Company's common stock. Also on October 14, 2025, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program from $2.0 billion to $2.75 billion, inclusive of the ASR Agreement. On October 15, 2025, the Company paid JPMorgan $750.0 million in cash and received an initial delivery of 35.4 million shares of common stock with a value equal to $600.0 million as of the date the ASR Agreement was executed, representing an estimated 80% of the total shares initially underlying the ASR Agreement. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is expected to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2026. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement will be based on the average of the volume-weighted average share price of the Company's common stock on specified dates during the term of the ASR Agreement, less a discount. During the first 40 weeks of fiscal 2025, inclusive of the $750.0 million ASR Agreement, the Company invested $1,361.6 million for the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the existing multi-year $2.75 billion repurchase authorization.

Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.825 billion to $3.875 billion, including approximately $65 million related to the Company's 53rd week (previously $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion)

Adjusted net income per Class A common share in the range of $2.08 to $2.16 per share (previously $2.06 to $2.19 per share)

Effective income tax rate in the range of 23% to 24% (previously 23.5% to 24.5%)

Capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion (unchanged)

The Company is unable to provide a full reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures (as defined below) used in the updated fiscal 2025 outlook without unreasonable effort because it is not possible to predict certain of the adjustment items with a reasonable degree of certainty.

Non-GAAP Measures and Identical Sales

Non-GAAP Measures. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income, Adjusted net income per Class A common share and Net debt ratio (collectively, the ""Non-GAAP Measures"") are performance measures that provide supplemental information the Company believes is useful to analysts and investors to evaluate its ongoing results of operations, when considered alongside other GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, gross margin, and net income per Class A common share. These Non-GAAP Measures exclude the financial impact of items management does not consider in assessing the Company's ongoing core operating performance, and thereby provide useful measures to analysts and investors of its operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Other companies may have different definitions of Non-GAAP Measures and provide for different adjustments, and comparability to the Company's results of operations may be impacted by such differences. The Company also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Net debt ratio for board of director and bank compliance reporting. The Company's presentation of Non-GAAP Measures should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Identical Sales. As used in this earnings release, the term ""identical sales"" includes stores operating during the same period in both the current fiscal year and the prior fiscal year, comparing sales on a daily basis. Direct to consumer digital sales are included in identical sales, and fuel sales are excluded from identical sales.

The strategy reflects growing confidence that voice could become a primary interface for AI systems embedded in homes, vehicles, workplaces and autonomous machines.

From Novelty Interfaces to Production Systems

Voice interaction is not new, but the reported direction marks a shift away from command-based assistants toward full-duplex conversational AI: systems capable of interrupting, responding in real time and managing dialogue more fluidly.

The Information reported that OpenAI had consolidated several internal research and product teams into a dedicated audio initiative, aimed at improving latency, turn-taking and conversational flow. These are areas where audio interfaces have historically lagged behind text-based models. These improvements were described as prerequisites for deploying voice AI in continuous, production-grade environments, rather than as experimental features.

This evolution is particularly relevant for robotics and embodied AI, where speech must function reliably alongside sensors, motion control, and decision-making systems. In these settings, audio becomes an operational interface rather than a convenience layer.

Enterprise and Commercial Implications

Beyond consumer devices, OpenAI’s reported audio strategy has implications for enterprise software, customer operations, and industrial automation.

The reporting suggested that OpenAI’s planned audio model was intended to support persistent, always-on interaction, allowing AI systems to remain context-aware without requiring explicit prompts. For businesses, this capability could enable new classes of AI agents to operate within workflows such as customer service, logistics, healthcare support and field operations. This is contingent on latency, compliance and reliability thresholds being met.

This positions audio AI as a potential bridge between cloud-hosted intelligence and edge-deployed systems, particularly in environments where screens are impractical, unsafe or distracting.

Latency, Trust and Infrastructure Pressure

The move toward conversational, always-listening systems raises fundamental questions for infrastructure providers and enterprises alike.

Low-latency audio interaction remains technically challenging at scale, especially when inference is handled in the cloud. As a result, analysts expect increased pressure on edge compute, distributed inference architectures, and on-device processing, particularly for robotics, wearables and in-vehicle systems.

Privacy and trust are equally critical. Persistent audio capture heightens concerns around consent, data retention and regulatory exposure, particularly in Europe, where voice data may be classified as sensitive personal information. Successful deployment is likely to depend less on model capability and more on transparent controls over what is recorded, stored, and processed.

Hardware Ambitions, Cautiously Staged

While OpenAI has explored hardware partnerships previously, The Information reported that any audio-first devices were positioned as a longer-term initiative, with internal timelines pointing to 2027 rather than an immediate commercial launch.

The cautious staging reflects lessons from earlier attempts to move beyond screens, where voice-centric products struggled with reliability, context awareness, and user trust. The reported focus suggests OpenAI is prioritising platform readiness and enterprise viability before committing to hardware at scale.

Why It Matters

OpenAI’s audio push is not just a product update; it is a signal of how AI interfaces are evolving as systems move closer to everyday deployment.

For consumer electronics, it points toward more ambient, screen-light interaction. For robotics, it reinforces speech as a control and coordination layer. Finally, for enterprises, it raises new questions about infrastructure design, latency, governance and how AI integrates into daily operations at scale.

Whether audio becomes the dominant interface will depend less on novelty and more on execution. In 2026, conversational AI will be judged not by how natural it sounds, but by how reliably it performs when systems are always on.",https://www.techerati.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Techerati-images-2026-01-07T112135.492.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 10:02:26.918495

Siegler,,,,,https://spyglass.org/microsoft-almost-acquistion-openai/,"I've long thought that the Inflection deal structure, and thus, the ""hackquisition"", was born out of a deal Microsoft nearly had to execute under duress.
Either OpenAI would reinstate Altman, or Microsoft would just hire the entire company.4 Sound familiar?
So yeah, Microsoft would have paid at least $25B, and perhaps $29B to do that would-have-been ""hackquisition"".
The key bit to remember here is that no one actually owned equity in OpenAI at the time.
And it highlights just how killer of a deal Microsoft would have gotten here.","When looking back at the origins of the ""hackquisition"" model for acquiring startups, Microsoft was clearly the godfather of such deals. Their March 2024 deal to not buy Inflection, but instead to bring on much of their team was groundbreaking in this regard, and it has led basically all of their rivals to copy (or expand upon) the same general structure.1 But actually, there was almost a ""hackquisition"" that Microsoft did before the Inflection deal... OpenAI.

I've long thought that the Inflection deal structure, and thus, the ""hackquisition"", was born out of a deal Microsoft nearly had to execute under duress. In November 2023, OpenAI's board ousted CEO Sam Altman and the ensuing weekend saw Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella on down, scramble to save the situation. The company had invested around $13B into OpenAI at the time – a lot of money in those days2 – and they were worried it was going to go to zero overnight.3 So they implemented a plan. Either OpenAI would reinstate Altman, or Microsoft would just hire the entire company.4

Sound familiar?

But wait, don't ""hackquisitions"" also involve some level of IP rights? You know, ""non-exclusive licensing agreements""? For show, if nothing else? Yeah, Microsoft didn't need those here because they already had far more rights to OpenAI's IP, thanks to their deal terms following their massive investments. So yes, this would have been the first ""hackquisition"". And now we know how much it would have cost.

Thanks to text messages from OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap, uncovered as part of Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, to Nadella and Altman, we have the number. $25B. Or $29B if they wanted to include Ilya Sutskever. Which of course Microsoft would have, but given his role in said coup d'état of Altman, it's not clear that would have happened...

As relayed by Rocket Drew of The Information:

Lightcap disclosed Sutskever’s financial stake after the OpenAI board fired CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella prepared to hire Altman and OpenAI colleagues. Lightcap wrote to Altman and Nadella that paying OpenAI employees for their equity would require $25 billion excluding Sutskever’s equity, or $29 billion including Sutskever’s vested units. (It’s not clear how much Sutskever had in unvested equity.)

The day following the exchange, Microsoft chief technology officer Kevin Scott said publicly that Microsoft would hire and match the compensation of every OpenAI employee who chose to resign from the startup, in the event that Altman was not reinstated at OpenAI. Those hires never happened because the OpenAI board rehired Altman later that night.

So yeah, Microsoft would have paid at least $25B, and perhaps $29B to do that would-have-been ""hackquisition"". That's not too surprising since OpenAI was valued at... $29B during secondary sales that were taking place at the time. But the math wouldn't have been quite that straightforward.

The key bit to remember here is that no one actually owned equity in OpenAI at the time. This was long before the conversion to the public benefit corporation, and everyone from Microsoft on down simply had percentages of the rights to future profits. Microsoft was clearly willing to ""true up"" those employees and match the on-paper value, and seemingly assume that those employee shares equated to 100% ownership of the company. Of course, there were other investors in OpenAI, even beyond Microsoft. So the bigger question remains if they would have given those other investors anything.5

That is, of course, another key component to the ""hackquisition"", paying out investors to ensure they go along with the deal. Given how freaked out those investors were during ""The Blip"", it seems reasonable to think they believed they'd be getting nothing for their investments. But it's also probably reasonable to think that Microsoft would have given them something to avoid future litigation, if nothing else. Again, this is what Microsoft did with Inflection investors several months later.

And if that's the case, that probably would have pushed the deal well past $30B – especially if you consider compensation for Altman, who famously had no direct equity – or even ""Profit Participation Units"" – in OpenAI at the time (and apparently still doesn't). But if Sutskever was going to get $4B... Microsoft probably would have wanted to keep Altman happy, in order to keep him.

Anyway, there was one massive shareholder Microsoft didn't need to pay out: Microsoft. Everyone now knows they own 27% of OpenAI, but again, at the time no one had any equity. Microsoft had the right to 49% of those profits (though actually a much higher percentage until their initial investment was paid back) and undoubtedly could have and would have argued that meant they ""owned"" 49% of the company. Unless it was regulators who were asking.

Had anyone else tried to ""hackquire"" – or even actually acquire – OpenAI, they probably would have wanted at least $15B for their troubles, if not more. And it highlights just how killer of a deal Microsoft would have gotten here.

Call it $30B - $35B to effectively buy OpenAI in late 2023. Given that the company is currently raising around an $850B valuation just over two years later...

Alas, by the end of the weekend, Altman was back in place atop OpenAI and ""The Blip"" was just that, a blip. This is clearly the outcome Nadella and Microsoft wanted, undoubtedly due to regulatory concerns if nothing else. But the mad scramble also pretty clearly planted the seed that would grow into the ""hackquisition"" model.",https://spyglass.org/content/images/size/w1200/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-7--2026--11_36_36-AM-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 08:01:14.838056

She highlights the mixed performance of current AI technologies, which succeed brilliantly in some tasks while faltering in others, challenging the notion of a one-size-fits-all human benchmark.

Anthropic President Daniela Amodei has challenged the AI industry's holy grail, suggesting that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—the theoretical point where machines match human-level intelligence—may already be an irrelevant concept. In a recent CNBC interview, Amodei argued that AGI no longer captures how AI systems simultaneously outperform humans in some areas while falling dramatically short in others. ""AGI is such a funny term,"" she said. ""Many years ago, it was kind of a useful concept to say, 'When will artificial intelligence be as capable as a human?' I think maybe the construct itself is now wrong—or maybe not wrong, but just outdated."" Her comments arrive as tech giants pour tens of billions of dollars into AGI development. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claims we're ""confident we know how to build AGI"" and predicts powerful AI agents will join the workforce in 2025. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis estimates AGI is five to ten years away, while Anthropic's own CEO Dario Amodei previously suggested it could arrive as early as 2026. Elon Musk predicted his xAI company would achieve AGI by 2026—notably, after predicting it would arrive by 2025 last year.

Claude already codes better than professional engineers at Anthropic

Amodei pointed to concrete examples where AI has already surpassed human capabilities. Anthropic's Claude model now writes code comparable to many professional engineers inside the company itself. ""That's crazy,"" she said, noting the speed of advancement. In November 2025, Claude Opus 4.5 became the first model to exceed 80% accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified, a benchmark using real GitHub issues that professional developers tackle daily. Yet these same systems still falter at tasks that humans handle with ease. “Claude still can’t do a lot of things that humans can do,” Amodei acknowledged. This tension—superhuman performance in narrow areas alongside conspicuous weaknesses—undermines the idea of a single, universal general intelligence threshold.

The real question isn't when AGI arrives, but how businesses actually use AI

Rather than the milestones of AGI, the urgent question, according to Amodei, is how companies use these tools and the speed at which people can adapt. Even as the models improve, he says, adoption slows due to managing change, buying processes, and the difficulty of spotting where AI really adds value instead of just hype. For Amodei, the future of AI won't depend on whether it fits some textbook definition of AGI. It's going to depend on what these systems can do, where they miss the mark, and how society chooses to use them.

A further 67% want brands to label AI‑generated adverts and content, underlining the desire for human control at every step.","Greater uptake of AI is forcing a number of sectors into a rapid transition, and shopping is no exception.

A quarter of consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025 and a further 31% plan to adopt them in future.

That’s according to a new report from IT firm Capgemini, based on global consumer responses and interviews with retail executives.

“Brands must move beyond being optimised for search to being optimised for selection,” said Dreen Yang, EVP, global consumer products and retail lead at Capgemini. “Success increasingly depends on being chosen by algorithms, not just found by consumers.”

In practice, shoppers can apply AI in different ways, whether they make purchases directly through a chatbot, use algorithms for advice, or allow a virtual assistant to spend money on their behalf.

Last year, for instance, OpenAI announced that it would be allowing US users to purchase Etsy, Shopify, and Walmart goods through ChatGPT.

Other companies, such as Amazon, have proven more hesitant, blocking OpenAI crawlers and thereby restricting access to its product listings. By focusing on its own AI ambitions, Amazon hopes to retain control over the e-commerce advertising market.

According to Capgemini, 63% of surveyed consumers want generative AI to provide hyper-personalised shopping content, although concerns around the technology remain. For instance, 71% of respondents said they were worried about how generative AI uses their information.

The desire for human assistance also remains strong, with 66% of those surveyed valuing human support at the point of purchase. This means brands should offer “a balanced mix of digital convenience and human support,” said Capgemini.

In particular, helpline chatbots on company sites, intended to give instant, 24/7 support, were comparatively unpopular, only satisfying 57% of respondents.

Appealing to the bots

According to the report, retailers must adapt to the new age of shopping or risk being left behind.

To improve traction with AI bots, firms should provide machine-readable, continuously refreshed data, enriched with product attributes. This means that the technology can interpret, surface, and recommend products in real-time.

AI tools are more likely to recommend companies that give detailed context about their goods, as it is easier for the bot to understand who the item is for and why it is relevant.

Third-party sources like reviews and ratings also matter, said Capgemini, as they influence how large language models describe the goods or the brand.

Looking ahead, the continued popularity of chatbot shopping is, however, reliant on a number of factors. One key question revolves around the appetite of AI firms for advertisement. If shopping assistants become densely populated with adverts, it’s possible that consumer trust in their recommendations will decline.

Tapping into the transition

When it comes to a firm’s own AI offerings, it's important to adapt the tech to the consumer’s preferences, said Capgemini.

In other words, brands that stand out are offering diverse shopping experiences through one interface. Some users like to explore on their own, while others prefer step-by-step recommendations, both of which can be accommodated using AI tools. Novel offerings include “try-on” features for clothes or accessories, as well as ‘AI style advisers”.

Transparency and control around this technology is also crucial, said the report. A majority of shoppers want to set strict boundaries on digital assistants such as spending caps, and 63% want to approve or reject purchases initiated by AI.

The investment forms – according to the bank – part of a broader strategy to engage with digital assets and tokenised forms of money. While they haven’t disclosed the size of the stake or the valuation of Ubyx, Barclay’s has stated that this was its first investment in a company focused on stablecoins.

Founded in 2025, Ubyx operates a clearing system designed to support stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are typically pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies. The platform aims to reconcile tokens issued by different stablecoin providers, addressing interoperability challenges as the number of issuers and blockchain networks continues to grow.

Interest in stablecoins and blockchain-based financial infrastructure has seen something of a renewal over the past year, with banks and financial institutions announcing a range of initiatives tied to digital assets.

This renewed momentum has been driven in part by rising cryptocurrency prices and renewed political attention in the United States, including support for the sector from President Donald Trump, which has contributed to increased market volatility and speculation.

Despite this renewed interest across the sector, many blockchain-related projects across the banking industry remain at an early stage of development.

Alongside Barclays, Ubyx has previously attracted investment from the venture capital arms of US crypto firms Coinbase and Galaxy Digital, according to PitchBook.

The stablecoin market itself has expanded rapidly, with the number of tokens in circulation rising sharply in recent years. El Salvador-based Tether currently leads the market, with $187 billion worth of tokens outstanding. Stablecoins are primarily used to move funds within cryptocurrency markets, though proponents argue their role could expand into mainstream financial services.

Barclays said the investment aligns with growing interest in tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins, particularly as regulatory frameworks begin to take shape in several jurisdictions. The bank described Ubyx as a clearing system for digital money, including tokenised deposits and regulated stablecoins.

The analysis piece - by Jim Burkhard, Vice President and Global Head of Crude Oil Research, and the S&P Global Energy Crude Oil Markets team - outlined that S&P Global Energy is still projecting a 1.4 million barrel per day global crude oil stock build in the first quarter of this year.
“However, there could be a more discernible impact on the heavy sour crude oil market,” the analysis piece stated.

The analysis also outlined that S&P Global Energy is still calling for Dated Brent to average $60 per barrel.

“However, there could be a more discernible impact on the heavy sour crude oil market,” the analysis piece stated.

“Venezuela accounts for one percent of global crude oil production but roughly nine percent of the world’s nine million barrels per day of heavy crude oil production. The United States and China are the world’s largest markets for heavy crude oil,” it added.

“Global heavy crude/heavy residual feedstock markets are currently narrowly balanced. Higher supply would be bearish for heavy sour crude differentials and high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) cracks. Lower supply would be modestly bullish,” it continued.

The analysis piece stated that, in 2025, Venezuela produced an average of 826,000 barrels per day of crude oil, excluding imported diluent that is blended into domestic production. Crude oil exports, including blended diluent, averaged 750,000 barrels per day, according to the analysis.

“Before Jan. 3, S&P Global Energy had already assumed a reduction in supply from Venezuela due to U.S. efforts to curtail exports on sanctioned oil tankers, and the view remains the same,” the analysis noted.

“While S&P Global Energy sees risk to the upside and downside in terms of production and exports, it is not enough either way to significantly alter the global oil balance in the first quarter,” it added.

“If sanctions were removed, Venezuelan oil production could grow but it would require at least several billion dollars or more of fresh investment to boost marketed production to 1.5 million barrels per day in the next 12-24 months - an increase of roughly 500,000 barrels per day from recent levels (including blended diluent),” it continued.

In the analysis piece, Burkhard stated that recent developments in Venezuela do little to alter the fact that the global oil market is facing a surplus at the start of 2026.

In a statement sent to Rigzone by the Morningstar team late Monday, which focused on the Venezuela situation, Morningstar’s director of equity research, Joshua Aguilar, said, “we don’t plan to alter our fair value estimates or our midcycle oil price estimates of Brent $65 per barrel and WTI $60 per barrel”.

“While significant Venezuelan supply increases to global markets could be bearish for our 10-year forecast, we think it will take years for supply to meaningfully increase,” he added.

“Venezuela will require years of large capital investments to modernize its infrastructure,” he continued.

In a comment sent to Rigzone early Tuesday, Aaron Hill, Chief Market Analyst at FP Markets, noted that the “Venezuela crisis trigger[ed]… [a] rally in commodities”.

“Crude markets … found support, with WTI rallying nearly 2.0 percent as the intervention cast fresh uncertainty over access to oil reserves,” Hill said.

In a statement sent to Rigzone on Monday morning, Naeem Assam, Chief Analyst at Zaye Capital Markets, noted that “oil remains range bound, with Brent near $60.9 per barrel and WTI around $57.4 per barrel, underscoring that macroeconomic weakness is outweighing geopolitical risk”.

“Despite U.S. actions tied to Venezuela and rhetoric from Donald Trump regarding control of Venezuelan oil assets under Nicolas Maduro, price reaction has been muted - clear evidence of headline exhaustion,” he added.

In a news conference held on January 3 in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, which was streamed by Sky News, U.S. President Donald Trump stated, “late last night and early today, at my direction, the United States Armed Forces conducted an extraordinary military operation in the capital of Venezuela”.",https://images.rigzone.com/images/rz-facebook.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 07:01:28.113876

That has implications for energy efficiency and the broader cooling market

When you think of liquid cooling for data centers, you probably don't think of hot water. But that’s exactly what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it can use to cool its new Vera Rubin supercomputers.

Contrary to what you might think (again), this could be good news for liquid cooling companies, despite the stock market's reaction to the news today. But first, here is the break-down of the news and what it means.

“The power of Vera Rubin is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. And yet – and this is the miracle – the air that goes into it, the air flow is about the same. And very importantly, the water that goes into it is the same temperature, 45 degrees C,” Huang said on the CES keynote stage on Monday. “With 45 degrees C, no water chillers are necessary for data centers. We are basically cooling this supercomputer with hot water.”

In case it’s not immediately apparent, this is a big change: 45-degrees Celsius is around 113-degrees Fahrenheit.

There are two big takeaways from this shift: one, it could be very good news for liquid cooling, and two, it could be good news for energy efficiency.

Good news for energy efficiency

Taking the latter point first, the ability to use high-temperature water eliminates the need for chillers and their power-hungry compressors. This, in turn, enables a shift to dry cooler systems.

Without nerding out too much, dry cooler systems can use ambient air – which in many places is under 45-degrees Celsius for many parts of the year – to cool the liquid running through the cooling system rather than a chiller.

Huang said in his CES address that the shift “enables us to save about 6% of the world's data center power.” That’s a huge deal in a market where access to power is a key constraint and consumption is a point of public criticism.

Good news for liquid cooling, too

But circling back to the first takeaway, the shift could also be good news for liquid cooling systems in general.

Dell’Oro Group noted in December that direct liquid cooling – the leading option for cooling high-performance computing – grew 85% in Q3 2025 and was on track to surpass $2 billion in yearly revenue.

“Liquid cooling has always had the opportunity to work at higher temperatures, like at 45-degrees Celsius, to cool these AI workloads,” Lucas Beran, Director of Product Marketing at Accelsius, told Fierce. “This cements the value that liquid cooling is bringing to the data center. You could not use 45-Celsius air to cool these processors.”

Beran added the change could especially be a boon for two-phase direct liquid cooling, which he said functions more efficiently at higher temperatures.

The dominant liquid cooling systems today are single phase, meaning the cooling liquid stays a liquid. Two-phase systems include a change from liquid to gas and back again. In October, Accelsius CEO Josh Claman told Fierce he believed two-phase cooling had reached a “tipping point” but noted some supply chain issues were slowing uptake of the technology.

“This starts to open the door for two-phase cooling’s better performance at higher facility water temperatures to resonate,” Beran said.

The looming question, of course, is what this means for the rest of the multi-billion-dollar data center cooling market. It doesn’t seem to bode well for vendors of traditional chiller and HVAC systems.

“If being able to support Vera Rubin chips with 45-degree Celsius water means you don’t need a chiller, then instead of buying a chiller you’re going to buy a dry cooler, which probably isn’t going to come from your traditional [heat] rejection supplier,” Beran said.

And the stock market reaction

Despite Beran's positive angle on the news, investors took it as a bad sign. Stocks for traditional cooling players Vertiv, Schneider Electric, Johnson Controls and Eaton all took a sharp dive when the markets opened after Huang’s address. All but Johnson Controls had recovered a few hours later. Vertiv, Schneider and Johnson all make chillers for data center applications.

Fierce reached out to Schneider and Vertiv for comment and will update this story when we hear back.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/liquid%20cooling%20silicon%20gpu_MJ%20for%20FN.png?VersionId=mwYyzRTGCJwBTaO6fzQPfcIs4pXxnWtF,N,,2026-01-07 11:03:57.906123

And its commanding EBIT of 16.0 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. It is well worth noting that Boston Scientific's EBIT shot up like bamboo after rain, gaining 31% in the last twelve months. That'll make it easier to manage its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Boston Scientific can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Over the last three years, Boston Scientific recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 87% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.

Our View

Boston Scientific's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! We would also note that Medical Equipment industry companies like Boston Scientific commonly do use debt without problems. Considering this range of factors, it seems to us that Boston Scientific is quite prudent with its debt, and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we've spotted with Boston Scientific .

By Alexander Jones, International Banker

The consensus among analysts is that broad stability will characterise the global banking sector in 2026. That said, the key industry risks that periodically cropped up during 2025 have the potential to return during the coming year. While credit-rating firms are largely “neutral” on the sector for the time being, with most core financial metrics unlikely to be spectacularly impacted, they remain watchful for specific trends that could trigger a more pronounced downside scenario.

According to S&P Global Ratings, four key risks will influence bank ratings in 2026:

An escalation of geopolitical risks, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and conflicts in the Middle East;

A stronger spillover from tariff shocks to the real economy and financial markets than initially anticipated;

A weakening of banks’ regulatory environments; and

Evolving risks, including climate change and new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI).

As the global economy demonstrated throughout 2025, heightened geopolitical risks remain inescapable. Some regions are now gearing up to ensure their banking sectors can withstand potential adverse shocks from escalating conflicts, with Europe likely to do the most in 2026 to counter any destabilising effects.

A report published in October by the European Parliament—“The Impact of Geopolitical Risks on the Resilience of Banks in the Banking Union”—spelled out only too clearly how seriously elevated geopolitical risks could rock the banking sector’s stability. According to the report, empirical research indicated that associated spikes in geopolitical-risk indices coincided with potentially sizeable drops in bank profitability (especially for smaller and weakly capitalised banks) and asset quality (particularly for smaller banks), as well as with increases in banks’ perceived risks, as measured by the credit-derivatives market.

From a supervisory perspective, the report also found that geopolitical risks were reinforced by certain weaknesses in the management of cybersecurity risks, a finding that was generated by an ad hoc stress test of the cyber-resilience of major banks. “Although recovery plans were present in all surveyed banks, many institutions did not have in place specific tools for managing complex scenarios and preserving customer data and assets,” the research added.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has urged Europe’s banking sector to accept a new reality with more frequent shocks, including tariffs and cyberattacks, and to remain prepared for a range of possibilities, even when the exact nature of the next crisis is unknown. “Geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies, climate and nature-related crises, demographic change and technological disruptions are exacerbating structural vulnerabilities, making the likelihood of extreme, low-probability events unprecedentedly high,” Europe’s top monetary institution explained in a November statement. It also confirmed that strengthening banks’ resilience to political risks and uncertainties will remain the ECB’s top supervisory priority, with a focus on prudent risk-taking and adequate capitalisation.

On the tariff front, meanwhile, banks worldwide will likely remain wary of extending credit to certain industries and businesses, particularly those reliant on global supply chains. With margins being squeezed and the risks of corporate-loan defaults and higher capital requirements elevated, banks in 2026 will want to ensure they lend only to companies with sufficiently contained credit-risk profiles.

Some analysts have pointed to Europe as the region with the highest banking-sector vulnerability to trade wars. Citing various studies on the subject, BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) found in August that European banking systems are both the “most” and “least” exposed to the trade war. “Italy is considered the most exposed via the Bank of Italy due to its exports to the United States and the composition of its credit portfolio, more concentrated in sectors affected by tariffs,” according to the Spanish bank. “Germany, Ireland and Slovenia have also been identified as vulnerable. Moody’s agrees in identifying Ireland, Germany and Italy as the most exposed, also suggesting that the banking systems of Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom could see their net interest margins (NIM) reduced due to the high proportion of variable-rate mortgages.”

Regarding the regulatory environment in 2026, analysts have stated that they expect a possible easing of certain rules for banks. Fitch Ratings, for example, projected an overall “looser” outlook for bank regulation as deregulation rises, with the United States and the United Kingdom leading the way—and to a lesser extent, the European Union (EU). Emerging markets, meanwhile, will see “tighter standards” to reduce banking-sector vulnerabilities and attract foreign investment.

“Key areas to watch for 2026 are the implementation of Basel III endgame rules in the US, amendments to resolution regimes, including depositor preference and capital stack, and digital asset innovation and the increasing scrutiny of private credit markets,” Fitch noted in its “Global Banking Regulation Outlook 2026” report. “We expect macroprudential policies to vary across regions, with a looser stance in low-growth developed markets and a tighter approach in high-growth, high-inflation emerging markets.”

While the major credit-rating firms have been clear about the key risks to global banking that may emerge in 2026, their overall outlooks have nonetheless suggested a largely moderate, stable environment for global lenders. For example, despite persistent challenges such as geopolitical tensions and high trade barriers, Moody’s 2026 outlook highlighted broad stability across the sector, with strong bank creditworthiness supported by resilient asset quality, solid funding profiles and sustained profitability.

This is largely owing to a resilient, albeit slowing, US economy, while several of the largest European countries may even see their real GDP (gross domestic product) gradually increase from modest levels. In emerging markets, Moody’s has highlighted rapid GDP growth across several key regions, particularly India, the fastest-growing economy in the G20 (Group of Twenty).

“Broadly stable employment levels and lower interest rates will support credit quality, although central bank monetary policies are diverging,” according to the rating firm’s global co-head of banking, Donald Robertson. “Net interest margins will likely be squeezed by lower rates in some regions, but banks will mitigate this by growing other sources of income. And healthy capital and reserve levels will continue to support both credit growth and shareholder distributions. However, the prospect of a looser regulatory environment adds some incremental risk for bank creditors.”

Similarly, S&P Global Ratings has forecast broad rating stability for global banks in 2026, with 85 percent of its ratings currently assigned a “stable” outlook. “Banks’ balance sheets are solid, characterized by good capitalization, sound asset quality, and adequate funding and liquidity,” an S&P report published on December 9 acknowledged. “That said, banks are operating at a volatile time, when significant policy decisions and regional conflicts could disrupt financial markets and rapidly change the economic environment.”

Moody’s also observed that banks will continue to invest in their businesses in response to the rapid development of private credit markets, artificial intelligence and digital assets, all of which will reshape the sector for many years to come. “Beyond macro and regulatory drivers, structural change is accelerating. AI is being deployed across risk management, compliance, customer service and product design, improving efficiency but also introducing new operational and cyber risks,” Moody’s “Outlooks 2026: Global Banks” explained.

“Private credit is expanding its role as an alternative source of finance for corporates, increasing competitive pressure on banks in some segments,” the outlook also noted. “At the same time, digital assets and tokenized financial instruments are prompting banks to adapt their technology stacks and risk frameworks.”

Could private credit pose a major risk to the banking sector this year? Not according to S&P Global Ratings’ managing director of financial institutions ratings, Brendan Browne. “Such lending requires strong surveillance, a thorough understanding of collateral, and safeguards to ensure that such collateral is not being double-counted, that is, pledged elsewhere,” Browne recently explained. “That said, we don’t see this as a material systemic risk that could cause major widespread problems for banks. However, NBFI [non-bank financial institution] lending is likely to continue growing at a robust pace. Furthermore, for some banks, NBFI lending as a proportion of total lending has grown well into the low double digits and sometimes into the mid-teens or higher.”

Fitch Ratings, however, has specifically cited the rising exposure to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), which now account for nearly 10 percent of bank loans, as a key risk to the banking sector, with US lenders particularly exposed. “While private credit offers opportunities, its complexity and opacity raise concerns about performance under stress,” according to Fitch’s November 21 outlook for US banks. “Consumer credit risk is increasing, particularly among lower-income borrowers facing high interest rates, eroding savings, and rising unemployment (forecast at 4.7 percent).”",https://internationalbanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Global-Banking.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 07:01:33.670077

ID27,L’Oréal,2026-01-07 11:05:10+00:00,Glossy,"Wellness Briefing: L'Oréal bets on LED, Amorepacific launches a smart mirror, and more from CES",Lexy Lebsack,,,,,https://www.glossy.co/beauty/wellness-briefing-loreal-bets-on-led-amorepacific-launches-a-smart-mirror-and-more-from-ces/,"The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas kicked off on Tuesday, and videos of viral new tech are already flooding social media.
The new mirror analyzes real-time skin-aging signals to predict aging and delivers personalized solutions tailored to individual needs, including product recommendations, according to the company.
“Amorepacific aims to lead the global beauty and wellness industry with holistic longevity solutions,” Hyojung Joo, head of Amorepacific’s digital strategy division, said in a statement.
L’Oréal Groupe is also betting big on new tech with its foray into LED light therapy.
“It’s the thinnest LED mask in the world, at one millimeter thick,” Guive Balooch, global vp of tech and open innovation at L’Oreal Groupe, told Glossy.","The Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas kicked off on Tuesday, and videos of viral new tech are already flooding social media. This includes an AI-powered robot that folds laundry, smart Legos that change color and an electric spoon that makes food taste salty without using actual sodium.

On the wellness front, bionic footwear gained momentum — it’s a technology that Nike is developing, as well, and is often described as “an e-bike for walking.” As expected, health tracking is also trending, seen in a body-scanning smart scale from Withings, a new tracker watch competitor to Whoop from the brand Luna, and a $899 Longevity Mirror from Nuralogix that tracks blood flow to the face to rate the user’s longevity.

But it was Amorepacific, parent company of brands like Laneige, Etude and Sulwhasoo, that received a CES Innovation Honoree Award — for Skinsight, a new smart mirror developed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Samsung Electronics. The new mirror analyzes real-time skin-aging signals to predict aging and delivers personalized solutions tailored to individual needs, including product recommendations, according to the company.

“Amorepacific aims to lead the global beauty and wellness industry with holistic longevity solutions,” Hyojung Joo, head of Amorepacific’s digital strategy division, said in a statement. The company did not share when the product will be available for sale.

L’Oréal Groupe is also betting big on new tech with its foray into LED light therapy. The company revealed an ultra-thin, flexible silicone mask on Tuesday, as well as eye patches. “It’s the thinnest LED mask in the world, at one millimeter thick,” Guive Balooch, global vp of tech and open innovation at L’Oreal Groupe, told Glossy. “It’s super, super easy to apply, it’s flexible, and we have [eye patch and] full-face versions, which is really cool.”

Both of the prototypes were made with U.K.-based I-Smart Developments, a global leader in LED device innovation and maker of LED masks from Omnilux, Beauty Pie and The Light Salon. Balooch believes that the large, plastic, helmet-like masks available from top brands will slowly lose their luster among consumers as thin, lightweight alternatives emerge. “[I-Smart Developments] found a way to make flexible electronics at the power [that is proven to be effective when] put into a mask,” he said. “It almost feels like a sheet mask.”

I-Smart Developments has completed more than 10 clinical tests on its LED lights, including four on L’Oréal’s new prototypes, which are shown to combat fine lines, sagging and uneven tone when used 10 minutes per day, Balooch said. L’Oréal Group is currently seeking FDA approval for both versions. If successful, Balooch will focus on developing chest, neck, forehead and chin versions. The exact price of the mask has not been determined, but it will launch at “a few hundred dollars,” to start, Balooch said. He hopes to rapidly scale manufacturing to lower the price for the mass market.

According to Mintel market research company, just 10% of U.S. consumers reported using an LED light therapy mask in 2025, up from 5% in 2023. However, Mintel found that these numbers soar when looking at interest among teenagers: 33% of U.S. consumers ages 12-17 reported using facial skin-care devices, like red-light masks or cleansing devices, within the past year.

Balooch told Glossy that L’Oréal Group will determine the right brand for the mask soon. He mentioned Lancôme, Armani, Prada and YSL as potential fits for the tech, which will launch in 2027.

“Longevity is a broad word, but for us, it’s about trying to, as much as possible, get our biology to be as young as possible — not just our chronological age, but also our biological age,” he said. “It’s a very exciting moment, because the tech is also evolving and allowing us to do it.”

Executive moves:

Esi Eggleston Bracey is stepping down from her role as chief growth and marketing officer at Unilever after an eight-year tenure at the conglomerate. Leandro Barreto, former CMO for Unilever’s beauty and wellbeing arm, will replace Bracey.

News to know:

TrueMed, an HSA- and FSA-focused online retailer, has taken on $34 million in Series A funding led by capital market firm Andreessen Horowitz. As previously reported by Glossy, pre-tax flexible-spending and health-spending accounts have grown in popularity as the “health is wealth” movement continues. As of January 2024, there was more than $1 billion in HSA and FSA accounts ready to be spent.

A new Gallup poll shows that more than half of Americans surveyed are interested in losing weight. The group found that 41% of Americans surveyed describe themselves as being overweight, and 26% are actively trying to lose weight. Broken out by gender, women are more likely to want to lose weight and more likely to attempt to lose weight. By age, around 30% of 18- to 34-year-old adults say they are overweight, compared with 44% of 35- to 54-year-olds, and 45% of adults aged 55 and older.

Healf, the U.K.-based wellness retailer, has hired A-list faces to front its resolution-focused marketing campaign starring supermodel Claudia Schiffer, DJ Calvin Harris and Olympian Miles Chamley-Watson. Schiffer is also an investor in the company, which took on an undisclosed investment from Iris Ventures in 2025.

The FDA approved the first oral GLP-1 on December 22. Currently called the “Wegovy pill,” it was developed by Danish pharma company Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, and could be available early this year, according to Reuters.

Stat of the week:

​​Americans plan to spend an estimated $60 billion in 2026 to support their health, fitness and exercise goals, according to a U.S. survey by the global trade association Health & Fitness Association. The group found that 89% of survey respondents believe regular physical activity is one of the most effective forms of preventive healthcare, with top goals including mobility, strength, posture, flexibility and mental health.

After a turbulent start to the year driven by critical analyst commentary, Adobe's stock has shown signs of stabilization mid-week. The core of investor skepticism revolves around artificial intelligence, with growing doubts about whether the software giant's AI models can translate into measurable revenue quickly enough. Market observers view the current price action as a tentative attempt to form a base in a jittery trading environment.

The recent weakness was triggered by a downgrade from the research firm Jefferies on Monday. Analysts removed their ""Buy"" recommendation, shifting the rating to ""Hold,"" and slashed their price target dramatically from $500 to $400. Their rationale carries significant weight: the anticipated revenue boost from generative AI, spearheaded by Adobe's Firefly models, has been slower to materialize than expected. According to Jefferies, the aggressive AI strategy for fiscal 2026 has not yet been monetized to the degree the market had priced in.

This assessment prompted further adjustments. BMO Capital Markets also reduced its price target to $400, although it maintained its ""Outperform"" rating. This follows earlier caution from KeyBanc in mid-December, which warned of stagnating growth projections for recurring revenue.

The Demand for Tangible Results

The landscape for software equities has shifted. Whereas 2025 was heavily influenced by hype surrounding technological potential, investors in 2026 are demanding concrete results on the balance sheet. Jefferies analysts noted that adoption of Adobe's tools by casual users is progressing more slowly than hoped, partly due to a flood of cheaper AI alternatives.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

Even Adobe's current presence at CES 2026 and the release of its ""Creative Trends Report"" have so far failed to sustainably improve market sentiment. Wall Street is now strictly focused on financial metrics rather than thematic trends, a pattern evident across the broader sector where competitors like Salesforce have also seen a weak start to the year.

Technical Perspective and Future Catalysts

Closing at $335.46 on Tuesday, the stock is now testing a crucial support level around $330. A sustained break below this zone could open the door to further downside, potentially toward the psychologically important $300 mark. On the upside, bulls would need to reclaim the $350 level to improve the technical picture.

For a fundamental reversal in trend, Adobe must deliver operationally in the coming months. Meeting its first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) forecast of $5.85 to $5.90, alongside demonstrating an acceleration in recurring revenue from AI products, will be critical to restoring investor confidence.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2425134_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 12:15:33.817895

Catch up quick: The term vibe coding — describing projects in natural language instead of code — was coined early last year, but most vibe coding tools still required some coding.
Claude Code changed this by letting users talk directly to an agent and giving Claude full read/write access to files.
Another feature working in its favor: Claude Code runs in the terminal, where programmers actually work.
You can build astonishingly complex apps without looking at a single line of code,"" Shipper writes on the Every blog.","The big picture: A mass market, easy-to-use coding tool is a game changer for the 99% of people who, until now, had to rely on other people's software to do anything from building custom data tools to automating repetitive work to building apps or websites.

And Claude Code — Anthropic's AI coding agent powered by models like Claude Opus 4.5 — is having a moment.

Zoom in: Professionals and dabblers alike say Claude's latest tool is best for coding and outperforms others like Cursor, GitHub Copilot and even Gemini 3 Pro.

The tool can read an entire codebase, plan complex changes, write and debug code autonomously, run commands and loop for hours on tasks.

Catch up quick: The term vibe coding — describing projects in natural language instead of code — was coined early last year, but most vibe coding tools still required some coding.

Even as recently as early summer 2025, users still had to understand what a tool was doing in order to use it, Dan Shipper, co-founder and CEO of AI subscription service Every, tells Axios.

""You still really had to understand the underlying architecture, and maybe you still needed to go look at the code,"" Shipper says. ""It would get lost or go off the rails.""

Claude Code changed this by letting users talk directly to an agent and giving Claude full read/write access to files. ""You just tell it to do something, and it works,"" Shipper says, calling it an ""infinite vibe coding machine.""

State of play: The explosion of online excitement about the tool isn't about one dramatic breakthrough, but a result of different factors coalescing.

""The underlying models keep getting better,"" former OpenAI board member Helen Toner tells Axios. ""It's not that it's a huge change, but it's a noticeable improvement.""

Another feature working in its favor: Claude Code runs in the terminal, where programmers actually work.

But Toner thinks the real catalyst was the winter holiday that gave people the extra hours to set up Claude and experiment with it.

Claude Code might be the latest darling, but some say OpenAI's models have also recently reached a kind of escape velocity.

""It genuinely feels to me like GPT-5.2 and Opus 4.5 in November represent an inflection point — one of those moments where the models get incrementally better in a way that tips across an invisible capability line,"" developer Simon Willison wrote in his blog late last year.

""We are in a new era of autonomous coding. You can build astonishingly complex apps without looking at a single line of code,"" Shipper writes on the Every blog.

Zoom out: Improved vibe coding has the ability to change who gets to make things and whether or not you even need to program.

""It's also a tremendous change in developer productivity, because once you're at that level, you're not just typing in a command and telling the agent to do something, and then just waiting. You're active.""

Shipper says this can give one engineer the productivity of four or five.

Yes, but: There's a big difference between being able to generate a working prototype via vibe coding and being able to create and iterate secure, enterprise-ready applications.

It often still takes someone with true programming skills to turn the former into the latter.",https://images.axios.com/Nn2V5-HoYAw4XcgZHIgl9z6aum4=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2026/01/06/1767735255166.jpeg,N,,2026-01-07 08:01:19.104346

Recognising that many fitness pledges drop by the end of January, the brand is turning a standard retail policy into a powerful tool to encourage active habit building, fun, and long-term commitment to movement throughout the year.

While 48% of Canadians prioritise fitness as their top New Year’s resolution, recent data from Drive Research (2024) reveals a stark tension: roughly 92% fail to see their resolutions through, with the second Friday of January infamously coined the 'Quitters Day.'

In response, Decathlon and creative agency Rethink are intervening at a pivotal moment, turning a simple purchase into a powerful act of self-commitment: Between January 1st and 31st, 2026, customers purchasing the KIPRUN 500 WR models are symbolically waiving their right to return the product, effectively 'locking in' their resolution. Members who stick to their resolution will be rewarded with 1,000 bonus loyalty points in recognition of their commitment to movement.

""We often talk about removing friction from the customer journey, yet here, we’re using friction as a strategic tool for motivation,"" said Xavier Blais, partner and executive creative director at Rethink. ""By challenging the standard return policy, we’re leaning into a fundamental brand truth: Decathlon deeply cares about its customers staying active. It’s a bold move for a retailer to suggest a product is unreturnable, but we’re flipping the script to show how this supports people’s goals: It transforms the brand from a vendor into an accountability partner.""

How does it work?

Everyone interested in starting their year in movement is encouraged to secure their own pair of the unreturnable shoe by following these easy steps:

● Purchase the Shoe: Go to decathlon.ca or visit any Decathlon store across Canada and purchase one of the best-selling running shoe models; KIPRUN men’s and women’s versatile and water-repellent running shoes, 500 WR.

● Take the Pledge: On the product page, customers will be shown a warning, stating that, by purchasing the shoes, they are agreeing to not return them as they’ll be sticking to their New Year’s resolution to keep moving.

● Receive the Reward: Customers will receive 1,000 bonus loyalty points upon purchase, and will keep them by completing their commitment (not returning the shoes for 30 days).",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2026-01/2321x2.gJpo2I0e.png,N,,2026-01-07 09:15:21.558397

With Delta trading at US$72.22, carrying an intrinsic value estimate that implies around a 49% discount and sitting only slightly below the average analyst target, you have to ask: is there still a buying opportunity here, or is the market already pricing in future growth?

As has been the case for the past two years at CES, AI is at the forefront of many companies’ messaging, though the hardware upgrades and oddities that have long defined the annual event still have their place on the show floor and in adjacent announcements. We’ll be collecting the biggest reveals and surprises here, though you can still catch the spur-of-the-moment reactions and thoughts from our team on the ground via our live blog right here.

Let’s dive right in, starting with some of Monday’s biggest players.

Nvidia reveals AI model for autonomous vehicles, showcases Rubin architecture

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivered an expectedly lengthy presentation at CES, taking a victory lap for the company’s AI-driven successes, setting the stage for 2026, and yes, hanging out with some robots.

The Rubin computing architecture, which has been developed to meet the increasing computation demands that AI adoption creates, is set to begin replacing Blackwell architecture in the second half of this year. It comes with speed and storage upgrades, but our Senior AI Editor Russell Brandom goes into the nitty-gritty of what distinguishes Rubin.

And Nvidia continued its push to bring the AI revolution into the physical world, showcasing its Alpamayo family of open-source AI models and tools that will be used by autonomous vehicles this year. That approach, as Senior Reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, mirrors the company’s broader efforts to make its infrastructure the Android for generalist robots.

AMD’s keynote highlights new processors and partnerships

AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su delivered the first keynote of CES, with a presentation that featured partners including OpenAI President Greg Brockman, AI legend Fei-Fei Lei, Luma AI CEO Amit Jain, and more.

Beyond the partner showcases, Senior Reporter Rebecca Szkutak detailed AMD’s approach toward expanding the reach of AI through personal computers using its Ryzen AI 400 Series processors.

Boston Dynamics and Google partner on Atlas robots

Hyundai’s press conference focused on its robotics partnerships with Boston Dynamics, but the companies revealed that they’re working with Google’s AI research lab rather than competitors to train and operate existing Atlas robots, as well as a new iteration of Atlas that was shown on stage. Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec has the full rundown.

Amazon’s AI-centric update with Alexa+ is getting the kind of push you’d expect at CES, with the company launching Alexa.com for Early Access customers looking to use the chatbot via its browsers, along with a similar, revamped bot-focused app. Consumer Editor Sarah Perez has the details, along with news on Amazon’s revamp to Fire TV and new Artline TVs, which have their own Alexa+ push.

On the Ring front, Consumer Reporter Ivan Mehta runs through the many announcements, from fire alerts to an app store for third-party camera integration, and more.

Razer joins the AI deluge with Project AVA and Motoko

In the past, Razer has been all about ridiculous hardware at CES, from three-screen laptops to haptic gaming cushions and a mask that landed the company a federal fine. This year, its two attention-grabbing announcements were for Project Motoko, which aims to function similarly to smart glasses, but without the glasses.

Then there’s Project AVA, which puts the avatar of an AI companion on your desk. We’ll let you watch the concept video for yourself.

With the feature called Spatial Aware, you use your smartphone camera to take pictures of a room decorated with Hue lights. The software identifies the light points and considers their location when distributing the color nuances of a color combination selected in the Hue app to the light points. Previously, the algorithms ignored whether the light points were adjacent or far apart – as is common with apps from lighting providers.

Continue after ad

Because the Hue software will consider spatial proximity in the future, lighting moods that imitate natural scenarios should appear more realistic. In a sunset scene, the lights on one side of the room would emit warm yellow tones to imitate the setting sun, while the ceiling lights on the opposite side would display darker color tones.

The function is scheduled to be available as a free update “from spring 2026” and will then be compatible with about half of the light scenes pre-installed in the app. Spatial Aware can then be activated via the light scene library.

HomeKit for cameras, AI for Automations

In addition to the new lighting concept feature, Philips Hue announces the long-awaited interface to Apple Home for the brand's security cameras in Las Vegas. The wired Hue Secure Camera, the Hue Secure Video Doorbell, and the Hue Secure Contact Sensors are to receive access to the Apple world by March 2026. From then on, live videos can be streamed via the picture-in-picture mode of the Apple TV set-top box, and push notifications from the Hue Secure system can be received in Apple's Home app. Philips Hue left open whether the cameras will then also support HomeKit Secure Video. The integration enables video storage in Apple's iCloud and location-based automations for camera recording. Previously, Hue lamps with Matter could be integrated directly into Apple Home, but not all of them.

The AI assistant, which has been announced repeatedly for a long time, is now finally to be launched in German. Philips mentioned the first quarter of 2026 as the timeframe. As soon as the AI assistance is available, it will enable rule-based creation of automations via voice input, contrary to what was previously known. Saying “Wake me up every day at 6:45 AM, except Wednesdays” should then be sufficient for the corresponding result, eliminating the need to click together the conditions with the graphical editor.

SpatialAware scenes take into account the position of all of the Hue lights in a room, using an algorithm to distribute light in a more natural way.

The savannah sunset scene with SpatialAware

The SpatialAware feature analyzes the layout of each room in the home with Hue lights, and then lighting scenes are tailored to your personal space. Lighting is meant to feel more immersive and dynamic than before.

The savannah sunset scene without SpatialAware

Right now, when a Scene Gallery scene is activated, the different colors are randomly sent to different lights without the system knowing where those lights are positioned. SpatialAware allows color to be distributed more intentionally for a more natural look. A scene that's designed to mimic a sunset, for example, will set lamps on one side of the room to warm yellow tones to mimic the setting sun, while lamps on the other side are set to darker shades.

SpatialAware requires the Hue Bridge Pro that came out last year, and it uses an iPhone or iPad camera to scan the room to figure out where each light is located. Scans can be updated with each new light that's added. SpatialAware will be accessible through the Scene Gallery, and it is an optional setting.

At launch, SpatialAware will be compatible with around half of the light scenes available in the Scene Gallery, and it has been designed primarily for nature-based scenes like lake mist, mountain breeze, and savanna sunset.

Along with SpatialAware, Signify is adding support for migrating multiple Hue bridges to a single Bridge Pro during the Bridge Pro setup process, and it is bringing Apple Home support to the Hue Secure camera line.

The Hue Secure Camera, Hue Secure video doorbell, and Hue contact sensors will work with Apple Home in the future, and users will be able to stream live video in picture-in-picture mode on the Apple TV and get real-time alerts using the Apple Home app.

The Hue AI assistant has been updated with the ability to create automations based on natural language user requests, such as ""wake me up at 6:45 a.m. every day except on Saturdays,"" and AI support is expanding to additional languages like Dutch, German, and Spanish.

Automations for lights and accessories are also now listed in the Rooms and Zones they control for easier adjustment, with options to rearrange content to put the most used automations front and center.

The new Hue SpatialAware feature is launching in spring 2026, while Apple Home support is coming in the first quarter of 2026. Multi-bridge migration and AI assistant automations are available now.",https://images.macrumors.com/t/0ytF2yHrAHCtRUNvDmDy-hHOty0=/1920x/article-new/2026/01/hue-spatialaware-savannah-sunset.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:48.966406

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

This isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.

In today’s report, the committee says: For a decade, this committee and its predecessors have urged the Ministry of Justice to get a better understanding of the wider costs of its legal aid reforms.
The Ministry of Justice and the Legal Aid Agency acknowledged that a cyberattack on the agency’s online digital services had begun in December 2024, four months before it was detected on 23 April 2025.
It called on the Ministry of Justice to publish a timetable for implementing all the means test changes.
The Ministry of Justice will respond in due course.","The Ministry of Justice should consider changing its name to the “Ministry of Justice (for Certain People)” if it refuses to “wake up” on the subject of legal aid, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee suggests in comments published this morning.

Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, a Conservative MP since 1992, said the so-called LASPO reforms to legal aid introduced in 2013 “are now at serious risk of going down in history as an extinction event for the entitlement to access to legal advice in large parts of the country”.

Dartmoor

In a report published this morning, the public accounts committee finds that the prison service, a Ministry of Justice executive agency, is spending around £4 million a year of taxpayers’ money on keeping Dartmoor prison in Devon empty because of its failure to negotiate a good deal for the lease. The prison, in use for more than 200 years, has high levels of radon gas.

Clifton-Brown said:

The issue of HMP Dartmoor is an absolute disgrace, from top to bottom.

We heard claims that the leasing of this unusable building, known for years by HM Prison and Probation Service to be choked with radon gas with all the health risks that entailed, was sensible, driven by the need for prison places. Our committee rejects this excuse outright.

Dartmoor appears to the committee a perfect example of a department reaching for a solution, any solution, in a blind panic and under pressure. This is obviously not how policy should be delivered.

Government must now respond to us on what it has learned from this catastrophic failure, and how nothing like it will ever be allowed to happen again.

Today’s report says that levels of radon in 2020 were nearly 10 times the acceptable limit in the prison kitchen. Despite that, the prison service signed a new lease in 2022.

The report says:

HMPPS acknowledged that it would have been helpful to have more information on the density of radon at the Dartmoor site prior to the lease negotiations.

However, it bizarrely maintained that signing the lease without undertaking a recent survey was sensible, given the prison capacity crisis at the time.

It argued that in the context of needing to spend over £600 per cell per night to temporarily hold prisoners in police cells under Operation Safeguard, £1.5 million a year for 640 prison places felt like good value for money…

Under the terms agreed, HMPPS cannot terminate the new lease until after December 2033.

Legal aid

A previous report by the public accounts committee in May 2024 had raised concerns about access to publicly-funded legal advice in areas of the country lacking face-to-face provision of legal aid.

The committee stressed that so-called legal aid deserts, large geographic areas without legal aid providers, risked disproportionately penalising groups who could access remote advice, such as people with disabilities or those with limited access to technology.

In today’s report, the committee says:

For a decade, this committee and its predecessors have urged the Ministry of Justice to get a better understanding of the wider costs of its legal aid reforms. A 2015 report noted the lack of analysis the Ministry of Justice had undertaken of the wider impacts of the reforms on itself and other government departments and stressed that it needed to do more.

In its 2024 report, the previous committee noted that while the Ministry of Justice acknowledged that the removal of most early legal advice via its reforms was likely to have led to additional costs to the public sector, its progress in measuring the scale of these costs was disappointing.

The Ministry of Justice and the Legal Aid Agency acknowledged that a cyberattack on the agency’s online digital services had begun in December 2024, four months before it was detected on 23 April 2025. It took action in April to boost security, informing legal aid providers that their bank details might have been compromised. However, the agency did not discover the full extent of the attack until 16 May 2025, at which point it took its systems offline

The risk of a cyberattack on the Legal Aid Agency’s systems had been rated as “extremely high” since 2021, it added.

Responses

Welcoming today’s report, solicitors’ representatives said that nearly 70% of the population were denied access to a community care legal aid provider in their area.

The Law Society said it had “long warned about the Legal Aid Agency’s antiquated computer systems”.

Their fragility had prevented vital reforms, including updates to the means test that could help millions more access legal aid. It called on the Ministry of Justice to publish a timetable for implementing all the means test changes.

The Ministry of Justice will respond in due course.

Cairo-based Bank NXT has partnered with IBM and Inspire for Solutions Development to modernise its technology stack as part of a broader push toward scalable, cloud-native digital banking.

Under the collaboration, Bank NXT has implemented IBM Instana, IBM Turbonomic, and IBM Cloud Pak solutions to strengthen real-time observability, automate resource optimisation, and improve system integration across its digital banking environment. The initiative aims to enhance platform resilience, minimise downtime, and expedite the delivery of digital services as Egypt’s banking sector advances toward more agile, technology-driven models.

Egyptian banks are increasingly under pressure to modernise legacy systems to support always-on digital channels, open banking connectivity, and collaboration with FinTech partners. Bank NXT’s technology upgrade reflects a wider industry trend toward cloud-native architectures and DevOps-driven operating models that can support rapid innovation while maintaining operational stability.

As part of the transformation, Bank NXT deployed IBM Instana to gain real-time visibility across its digital banking applications, enabling proactive monitoring and quicker issue resolution. IBM Turbonomic has been introduced to automate intelligent resource allocation across hybrid cloud environments, helping optimise IT utilisation and control infrastructure costs as transaction volumes scale.

The bank has also adopted IBM Cloud Pak for Integration and IBM Cloud Pak for Business Automation, running on Red Hat OpenShift, to consolidate systems and simplify application development and deployment. According to the bank, this has reduced platform complexity and supported a continuous delivery model for new digital services.

“Our collaboration with IBM and Inspire for Solutions Development is a crucial part of the bank’s transformation strategy,” said Tamer Seif, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Bank NXT. “By adopting the DevOps model and improving our business automation capabilities, we have enhanced the flexibility of our technology infrastructure. This prepares us to integrate with FinTech companies through an API-driven ecosystem and deliver faster, more responsive services.”

Alongside technology deployment, Bank NXT is investing in workforce upskilling through training programmes focused on observability, automation, integration, and DevOps practices. The bank said this is intended to ensure long-term sustainability of its digital platform and support the continued rollout of new digital banking services across retail and corporate segments.",https://ibsintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/banknxteg_logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:14:00.263858

Morgan Stanley Warns AI Could ... - International Business Times UK,Jim Manzon,,,,,https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/your-banking-job-safe-morgan-stanley-warns-ai-could-wipe-out-200000-european-roles-2030-1768978,"'Many banks have quoted efficiency gains coming from AI and further digitalisation to the tune of 30%,' Morgan Stanley noted in its report.
Several European lenders have already begun restructuring with artificial intelligence at the core of their cost-cutting strategies.
In November, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans to reduce around one-fifth of its full-time workforce by 2028, according to the Economic Times.
'Otherwise, we're storing up a big problem for the future,' Hillery cautioned, according to the Economic Times.
Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, acknowledged that efficiency gains from AI are already evident in sectors such as audit, law, and consulting.","If you work in banking, your job security may have recently been called into question.

Morgan Stanley has projected that more than 200,000 European banking jobs could disappear by 2030, warning that artificial intelligence and rapid digitalisation are set to transform the sector in ways not seen for decades, according to a report by the Economic Times.

The analysis, which covers 35 major European lenders employing approximately 2.12 million staff, suggests that banks could reduce their workforce by around 10% within the next five years. This would equate to approximately 212,000 jobs lost across the continent.

For employees in certain areas, the outlook appears particularly bleak.

Which Roles Are Most at Risk?

Morgan Stanley's analysis indicates that job losses are expected to hit 'central services' divisions hardest. These include back-office and middle-office functions, as well as risk management and compliance positions.

The rationale is clear: these roles involve tasks that AI systems can perform more quickly and at lower cost. Monitoring transactions, preparing regulatory reports, and processing large datasets are prime candidates for automation through machine learning tools.

'Many banks have quoted efficiency gains coming from AI and further digitalisation to the tune of 30%,' Morgan Stanley noted in its report.

For workers whose daily responsibilities involve spreadsheets, regulatory checks, and data reconciliation, the implications are stark.

Banks Already Acting on AI Strategies

This forecast is not merely hypothetical. Several European lenders have already begun restructuring with artificial intelligence at the core of their cost-cutting strategies.

In November, Dutch lender ABN Amro announced plans to reduce around one-fifth of its full-time workforce by 2028, according to the Economic Times. The bank has identified AI as increasingly capable of handling tasks currently performed by staff, particularly in operations and compliance functions.

Similarly, in France, Société Générale's chief executive Slawomir Krupa has taken an assertive stance. 'Nothing is sacred', he declared in March, signalling that no division would be exempt from his drive to lower the bank's persistently high costs.

Why the Urgency? Investor Pressure Intensifies

This push towards automation is driven by mounting pressure from shareholders frustrated with European banks' persistently weak returns on equity, especially in comparison with their American counterparts.

Morgan Stanley analysts highlighted that AI offers lenders a new opportunity to improve their cost-to-income ratios—an important efficiency metric closely scrutinised by investors—particularly as traditional cost-cutting measures have 'largely run out of momentum.'

The forecast underscores how increased digitalisation could significantly reshape Europe's banking landscape in the coming years, especially among consumer-focused lenders and in countries like France and Germany, where cost-to-income ratios remain relatively high.

Senior Bankers Urge Caution

Despite the sector-wide push for AI-driven efficiencies, some senior figures within banking are urging restraint.

Conor Hillery, JPMorgan Chase's co-chief executive for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, warned against abandoning fundamental skills in the rush to automate. He emphasised that JPMorgan aims to balance AI utilisation—speeding up routine tasks—while ensuring junior staff continue to develop vital skills such as building cash-flow models and analysing price-to-earnings ratios.

'Otherwise, we're storing up a big problem for the future,' Hillery cautioned, according to the Economic Times.

Jason Napier, head of European banks research at UBS, acknowledged that efficiency gains from AI are already evident in sectors such as audit, law, and consulting. However, he noted that banks have yet to fully realise similar benefits. 'Cost bases remain large, and these powerful new tools are still not fully implemented,' he said.

UBS has already begun experimenting with AI-generated content, producing analyst avatars that deliver video updates to clients. The Swiss bank recently sent 250 of its senior leaders to Oxford University for an AI-focused leadership summit.

What Does This Mean for Banking Employees?

For the 2.12 million people currently employed by Europe's major banks, the next four to five years will likely require adaptation—whether through retraining for higher-value roles, transitioning to emerging functions, or exiting the industry altogether.

Morgan Stanley's message is clear: the era of AI-driven banking has arrived, and not everyone will be able to keep pace.",https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1780797/ai-adoption.png,N,,2026-01-07 04:13:44.574915

The foundation is a 2005 Lotus Elise, but that’s where anything resembling stock ends. Up front, Schmauderer imported an Exige V6 nose from overseas, then fabricated custom panels to make it work with the Elise chassis. Around back, things get even more involved: he sourced a wrecked Exige, salvaged the rear clamshell, repaired it, and grafted it onto his car. The result is a car that plenty of folks would likely take as the real deal.

The bodywork is only the appetizer, though. “The hardest part of the build was taking a 200 horsepower engine and building from scratch a complete system that could handle an excess of 1000 horsepower,” Schmauderer told Road & Track.

This was his first turbo build from the ground up, meaning everything, including fabrication, welding, wiring, ECU calibration, and drivetrain, had to be learned the hard way. “There was a lot of trial and error,"" he said. ""The build took many years of tinkering and has had four or five different configurations to make it how it currently sits.”

Originally, Schmauderer tried to make the Elise’s stock Toyota-sourced 2ZZ work. “I initially turboed the stock motor and was mildly boosted, which was still fun, but it maxed out the platform,” he said. Eventually, practicality won out. “I decided on [a new] powertrain after realizing the stock 2ZZ motor wasn’t going to cut the cheese.”

The solution came unexpectedly: a fully built K24/K20 “Frankenstein” Honda engine he scored for just $1500. Now force-fed by a turbocharger, the setup makes around 750 horsepower. That's an almost absurd number for a car that weighs well under 2000 pounds. It sends that power through a manual transmission, with a center-exit exhaust for maximum drama.

And here is maybe the best part: he's not done. Schmauderer already has a larger turbo rated for over 1000 horsepower sitting in the garage. “The goal would be to make the fastest stick-shift Lotus on the quarter mile,” he said. Everything else, he claims, is already ready for four digits. Lotus never sold the Exige America wanted, but now the Land of the Free arguably has the most desirable one. Eat your heart out, everybody else.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/untitledhjk-695c3153b681c.jpg?crop=0.832xw:0.738xh;0,0.142xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-06 23:59:17.991964

""Curious people get more done, and we've built a set of AI tools and assistants that help users do more with AI,"" Srinivas told Business Insider.","Since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022, the AI sector has undergone a significant transformation.

Model capabilities have advanced, agents are proliferating, and enterprises are spending big to roll out AI across their workforces.

At the same time, generative AI-human interactions have started to fuel mental health concerns. Investors continue to wait for their billion-dollar bets to yield returns. Companies contend with whether AI is actually boosting productivity. It's not just models creating friction: the data center boom that underpins AI deployment is straining electric grids and increasing utility bills, raising concerns about the tech's long-term sustainability.

Building the most powerful AI systems at the fastest rate possible is no longer enough to compete in today's AI arms race. Leaders must also consider public safety, trust, and environmental impacts.

So, who's stepping up to these challenges?

Since 2023, Business Insider's AI Power List has recognized the most influential people in AI across sectors. Looking back to the past 12 months, we've identified 25 key players who we believe are shaping this next wave of AI innovation — from the C-suite and behind the scenes.

They include executives designing AI infrastructure, investors betting on long-term value over hype cycles, researchers and activists confronting the social costs of AI, and founders building tools designed to help rather than harm. Together, they represent where AI will go next.

There are risks for the company that are holding Nvidia's stock valuation down. Wall Street is pricing in the potential for a slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure, while also accounting for the increasing competition in the AI chip market.

Still, leading cloud service providers continue to see demand for compute capacity outpace supply, which is good news for Nvidia. Nvidia's cloud customers are buying every graphics processing unit (GPU) the company can supply.

Admittedly, the EliteBoard G1a is essentially a business laptop that's had the screen ripped off and the sides all chopped away.
However, the EliteBoard G1a can be configured to house a 32 Wh battery.
And yet, despite all its limitations, the EliteBoard G1a reminds me somewhat of the first home computers I used in the early 1980s.","Ask any tech vendor and they'll always tell you that smaller is better. CPUs and GPUs have never been tinier underneath the heatsink, but PCs themselves are still big and boxy. Not so HP's newly launched EliteBoard G1a range, because at under 780 grams in weight and 36 cm in length, it's possibly one of the smallest PCs around.

Admittedly, the EliteBoard G1a is essentially a business laptop that's had the screen ripped off and the sides all chopped away. But even so, the remaining keyboard still sports a numpad (though the whole thing is too compact to be classed as full-sized) and the internal gubbins are respectable enough, if just not very potent.

Not that HP is aiming the EliteBoard at gamers, of course. This is an AI PC for business users (the dedicated Copilot button really stands out), but if you got one with the best processor on offer, then you could do a spot of handheld-like gaming while pretending to juggle spreadsheets at work.

The chip in question is an AMD Ryzen AI 7 350 Pro, which is a Kracken Point APU, with eight Zen 5 cores (4x Zen 5, 4x Zen 5c) and a Radeon 860M integrated GPU. That sports eight RDNA 3.5 compute units, which equate to 512 shaders. That's roughly the same as the Steam Deck's GPU, so it should give you an idea as to what kind of gaming you can do on it.

HP also offers the EliteBoard G1a with a Ryzen AI 5 340 Pro (six CPU cores, four GPU compute units) or the miserable Ryzen 3 330 (four CPU cores, two GPU compute units), so if you were offered a G1a at work, I know which chip I'd be demanding.

Naturally, for such a market, RAM options are limited to a maximum of 64 GB, in the form of two DDR5-5600 SODIMMS, and up to 2 TB of Gen 4 NVMe storage. For some reason that I can't fathom just yet, the Ryzen 7 350 variant comes with 32 GB of eMMC flash storage, whereas the others don't. Answers on a postcard as to what one can genuinely use that for.

The whole caboodle requires a 65 W power supply to run, and you can provide that either via the provided adapter, or if you have a suitable monitor, you can use the same USB Type-C cable for sending the display signal. However, the EliteBoard G1a can be configured to house a 32 Wh battery.

For connectivity options, it's barebones, I'm afraid: just two USB Type-C ports (USB4 and USB 3.2 10 Gbps), and either Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. Oh, and Bluetooth 5.3 or 6, depending on what Wi-Fi module you choose. There's no LAN port, SD card reader, or anything else.

And yet, despite all its limitations, the EliteBoard G1a reminds me somewhat of the first home computers I used in the early 1980s. Those were very much the same thing: just a keyboard with a couple of sockets, plus a cable for the TV and one more for power.

Even though they were incredibly basic, I enjoyed years of programming and gaming on them, and I dare say the same thing could happen with this svelte HP.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9ozn9B2ifHCo4dQTVC9RH-2560-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 00:58:25.278952

An update from Plug Power ( (PLUG) ) is now available.

On December 30, 2025, Plug Power entered into a 15-year Release Event License Agreement with Walmart that establishes a contingency framework for Walmart to access escrowed GenKey System-related software, documentation and materials solely for internal maintenance of its facilities if certain defined release events occur, while Plug Power retains all intellectual property rights. The agreement also sets out Plug Power’s efforts to qualify alternative fuel cell stack suppliers, gives Walmart limited conditional rights around stack sourcing, provides for compensation to Walmart under certain circumstances for costs to sustain industrial truck operations, and structures a tiered fee arrangement under which Walmart pays one-time and annual license fees that increase if a release event is triggered. As part of the deal, Walmart irrevocably terminated a 2017 transaction agreement and forfeited all vested portions of a warrant to purchase Plug Power common stock, with all unvested portions cancelled, thereby eliminating potential future dilution of up to 42,192,479 shares and removing 34,554,185 vested warrant shares and 7,638,294 unvested shares from Plug Power’s future share issuance overhang.

Spark’s Take on PLUG Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, PLUG is a Neutral.

Plug Power’s overall stock score reflects significant financial challenges, with persistent losses impacting profitability and cash flow. However, positive strategic initiatives and corporate events provide some optimism. Technical analysis and valuation remain moderate, with mixed signals and a challenging valuation due to ongoing losses. The earnings call highlighted strong revenue growth and strategic positioning, contributing positively to the score.

AI Tools in Shopping AI tools are becoming a staple of online shopping services, no longer in experimentation but readily accessible to customers throughout their shopping journey.","Capgemini has released its 2026 Consumer Report, detailing how consumer value has now shifted toward fairness, transparency, and emotional connection.

The technology service provider has revealed that consumers now prioritize fairness and transparency, with 71% of respondents agreeing they would switch brands if pack sizes or quality of products were decreased without prior communication.

Furthermore, the report highlights how AI tools have become significantly more influential in online shopping; however, consumers still expect transparency when AI comes into play.

The report, which surveyed 12,000 consumers, uncovers that even as technology grows in the retail space, human interaction remains essential to its success.

Fairness and Transparency

Despite low pricing still driving significant revenue, fairness and transparency are also key to defining value for a brand.

This comes with clear communication; if one brand can clearly advertise its products with promotional and valuable deals, customers are keen to switch their loyalty to brands that can provide this.

In fact, 74% of consumers revealed they would switch brands if they had found lower prices elsewhere, as well as 61% agreeing that promotional bundles that combine products with higher value services are worth purchasing. These can include guaranteed faster deliveries, or product benefits that assure cleanliness, health, or environmental advantages.

Priyanka Bhargav, Head of Insights and Brand Strategy at Flipkart, argues that consumers are more likely to spend more for free delivery promotions, discounts, and bundles if brands can advertise these extras as valuable:

“These customers are willing to pay a little extra for faster delivery, signaling that convenience and immediacy are becoming universal expectations.”

Low pricing cannot get the results on its own, brands that can provide meaningful experiences with clear transparency to their consumers will set the expectations in the industry.

However, consumers are still willing to purchase products that are more expensive, as the report notes an increase in customer assessments, not just product, quality, and price, but also the brand itself.

If a brand can prove it holds itself to reliable, transparent, and ethical standards, they are more likely to see an increase in consumer loyalty.

Transparency is more than clear communication, it influences trust and loyalty by demonstrating how it puts customers first.

Brand Connection

Consumers are also willing to stay with a brand if their loyalty is already established, usually if there’s a previous level of trust and admiration, especially if it’s for both parties.

For example, a consumer who works or has previously worked with a brand may stay loyal when making purchasing decisions as a personal connection has previously been established.

If a brand is already well-established, with high-end luxury shops such as Chanel or Gucci, this can foster brand loyalty without the need for promotional bundles, but having already positioned itself as a stereotypical desired brand.

Customers are unlikely to move to a non-luxury brand during price increases or product changes as this comes with the brand expectations, consumers of high-retail brands are likely to remain loyal as customers remain trusting in their company decisions.

This is also true of child-centered brands, where parents are more likely to remain loyal to a brand during price increases or product changes if their child is showing positive signs with a brand compared to another.

In regard to pricing, customers may also choose to stay with a brand long-term if it offers customized benefits and rewards for remaining loyal.

In the report, 70% of consumers agreed that personalized coupons based on their purchase history was a good practice, as well as 68% of consumers believed that member-only pricing for loyalty program subscribers was a good idea.

These practices provide emotional brand connection, if consumers believe they are being offered reduced prices to help with their everyday purchases, they are more likely to stay.

AI Tools in Shopping

AI tools are becoming a staple of online shopping services, no longer in experimentation but readily accessible to customers throughout their shopping journey.

The report reveals that 2025 saw a quarter of respondents having used Gen AI shopping tools to enhance their decision-making, as well as over 73% of consumers having used a chatbot for query resolution at least once.

These tools provide customers with out-of-hours support, product availability, and promotions for discounted purchases.

These AI bots can also be used to continue customer engagement even after a purchase is made, with 61% of consumers having received personalized follow-ups and 54% satisfied with the results, featuring product instructions, tips, and recommendations.

By offering post-purchase support, brands can boost their customer engagement and increase future purchases.

However, almost half of the respondents who use chatbots are not satisfied with the experience, as many retail bots still lack the ability to deliver human-level capabilities, or even transfer consumers to a human support agent.

Friction AI bot experiences can taint a consumer’s impression of a brand, increasing disengagement and disappointment.

This has led to only 8% of respondents agreeing they would pay a monthly fee for a chatbots or AI assistant to make automatic purchases on their behalf, highlighting how AI bots still have a long way to go before building absolute customer trust.

Currently, 76% of consumers want to set boundaries for these digital assistants; by ensuring customer control around preferences, privacy, data management, and shopping experiences, AI can enhance its relevance in the industry if the customer is confident in the bot’s actions.

By first introducing clear transparency around data governance, compliance and security measures, brands can then introduce customers to AI assistant perks, personalizations, and rewards.",https://www.cxtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Capgemini-Reveals-How-Transparency-and-Connection-Now-Drives-Consumer-Loyalty.png,N,,2026-01-07 08:00:40.927501

If this has you thinking beyond packaged foods, it could be a good moment to widen your search with and spot companies where growth and insider conviction line up.

With Kraft Heinz shares lagging over 1 and 3 years, yet trading at a discount to analyst targets and some models of intrinsic value, you have to ask: is this a reset level that offers upside, or is the market already pricing in all the growth ahead?

Most Popular Narrative: 13.3% Undervalued

With Kraft Heinz last closing at US$23.51 against a narrative fair value of US$27.13, the current gap is all about what future earnings power looks like.

Ongoing portfolio optimization divesting non-core brands and reinvesting into high-margin segments and key power brands should lead to structurally higher operating margins and improved profitability in future periods. Continued disciplined investment in marketing and the Brand Growth System, especially in North America retail, is already showing performance improvement and is expected to stabilize and eventually reaccelerate top line revenue while maintaining pricing power in an environment of rising consumer price sensitivity.

Curious what kind of margin rebuild and earnings path need to play out to back that fair value and discount rate? The full narrative lays out the revenue slope, the profit swing, and the valuation multiple that have to line up for Kraft Heinz to close that gap.

Result: Fair Value of $27.13 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there are still pressure points, including weaker North America volumes and inflation driven cost headwinds, that could keep margins and revenue trends under strain.

CES is a huge opportunity annually for companies both large and small to parade products they plan to put on shelves this year. As predicted, artificial intelligence was anchored in nearly everything as tech firms continue to look for AI products that will attract customers.

Here are the highlights from Day 1:

Nvidia gets physical

The biggest buzzword in the air at CES is ""physical AI,"" Nvidia's term for AI models that are trained in a virtual environment using computer generated, ""synthetic"" data, then deployed as physical machines once they've mastered their purpose.

CEO Jensen Huang showed off Cosmos, an AI foundation model trained on massive datasets, capable of simulating environments governed by actual physics. He also announced Alpamayo, an AI model specifically designed for autonomous driving. Huang revealed that Nvidia's next generation AI superchip platform, dubbed Vera Rubin, is in full production, and that Nvidia has a new partnership with Siemens. All of this shows Nvidia is going to fight increased competition to retain its reputation as the backbone of the AI industry.

But once Huang called for two little, waddling, chirping robots to join him on stage, that's all the audience wanted to see more of.

The chips are back in town

AMD CEO Lisa Su announced a new line of its famed Ryzen AI processors as the company continues to expand its footprint in the world of AI-powered personal computers.

For gamers, AMD also showed off the latest version of its gaming-focused processor, the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D.

Meanwhile, Intel announced its new AI chip for laptops, Panther Lake (also known as the Intel Core Ultra Series 3), and said the company has plans to launch a new platform to address a growing market for handheld video gaming machines.

WATCH: What's next for AI and has its explosive growth in 2025 created a bubble?

Intel, a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone. It fell further behind after the AI boom propelled Nvidia into the spotlight.

President Donald Trump's administration stepped in recently to secure a 10% stake in the company, making the government one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel to support U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.

Uber dives back into the robotaxi game

Uber is giving the public a first look at their robotaxi at CES this week. Uber, along with luxury electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Motors and vehicle tech company Nuro, introduced an autonomous vehicle with an Uber-designed in-cabin experience.

Uber calls it the most luxurious robotaxi yet. It features cameras, sensors and radars that provide 360-degree perception and a low-profile roof ""halo"" with integrated LEDs that will display riders' initials to help them spot their car and track their ride status. Inside, riders can personalize everything from climate and seat heating to music, while real-time visuals show exactly what the vehicle is seeing on the road and the route it plans to take.

Autonomous on-road testing began last month in San Francisco, led by Nuro, marking a major step toward what the companies said is a planned launch before the end of the year.

Star Wars and Lego announce a new partnership

When Lucasfilm chief creative officer David Filoni brought out an array of X-Wing pilots, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C-3PO, he won the Star Wars fandom for Lego.

Lego announced its Lego Smart Play platform on Monday, which introduces new smart bricks, tags and special minifigs for your collection. The new bricks contain sensors that enable them to sense light and distance, and to provide an array of responses, essentially lights and sounds, when they are used in unison.

Combine this with a newly announced partnership with the Star Wars franchise and now you can create your own interactive space battles and light-saber duels.

LG reveals a new robot to help around the home

File this one under intrigued, for now.

The Korean tech giant gave the media a glimpse Monday of its humanoid robot that is designed to handle household chores such as folding laundry and fetching food. Although many companies have robots on display at CES, LG certainly is one of the biggest tech companies to promise to put a service robot in homes.

It will be on display beginning Tuesday, so we'll have more to report soon.

What's new with lollipops?

Music you can taste was on display Monday at CES: Lollipop Star unveiled a candy that plays music while you eat it. The company says it uses something called ""bone induction technology,"" which lets you hear songs — like tracks from Ice Spice and Akon — through the lollipop as you lick it or bite it in the back of your mouth, according to spokesperson Cassie Lawrence.

The musical lollipops will go on sale after CES on Lollipop Star's website for $8.99 each. And if that wasn't enough star power, Akon was expected to visit the company's booth Tuesday when CES opens to the public.

Atlas holds up Hyundai's (manufacturing) world

Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics publicly demonstrated its humanoid robot Atlas for the first time at the CES tech showcase, ratcheting up a competition with Tesla and other rivals to build robots that look like people and do things that people do.

The company said a version of the robot that will help assemble cars is already in production and will be deployed by 2028 at Hyundai's electric vehicle manufacturing facility near Savannah, Georgia.

Delta gets spherical

Delta Air Lines is taking entertainment to new heights as the ""official airline"" of the Sphere in Las Vegas. The airline announced a new multiyear partnership with Sphere Entertainment Co. that it says will deliver premium experiences to the venue, including a Delta SKY360° Club lounge.

The carrier said SkyMiles members can unlock exclusive access to other experiences at the Sphere, starting during the final weekend of the Backstreet Boys' residency in February with features including private suite seating, food and beverages. The partnership brings Delta branding to the Sphere's massive exterior LED screen. Delta says more exclusive SkyMiles experiences will roll out in 2026 and beyond.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-05T185132Z_686794914_RC23VIAGP4O2_RTRMADP_3_TECH-CES-1024x646.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:59:20.294177

Former Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told Skift in September that the ultra-low-cost carrier was also considering an in-flight Wi-Fi option.
Delta Air Lines also has free Wi-Fi on most of its domestic and international flights.","American Airlines launched free in-flight Wi-Fi Tuesday, joining a growing industry trend that has carriers racing to offer travelers high-speed connections.

The airline said it would roll out the free Wi-Fi in phases across all of its narrowbodies and dual-class regional fleets, and expects the installation to be complete by early spring. American’s new Boeing 787-9 and 787-8 will also feature free Wi-Fi.

The Wi-Fi is free only for members of American’s loyalty program. AT&T is sponsoring the service and Viasat and Intelsat are providing the connectivity.

American was reportedly in talks with Amazon for Leo in-flight Wi-Fi, according to Bloomberg News. American did not confirm whether it was considering Amazon.

“American Airlines is committed to delivering an enhanced customer experience that meets the expectations of today’s travelers and to ensure as such, we are constantly in conversation with various companies and groups to discuss future opportunities,” American said in a statement to Skift.

Free Wi-Fi has become an increasingly popular option for airlines as the industry looks to cater to more premium and business travelers. JetBlue was the first U.S. carrier to offer free Wi-Fi in 2013 and is now the launch customer for Amazon’s Project Kuiper, a competitor to Starlink. Former Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle told Skift in September that the ultra-low-cost carrier was also considering an in-flight Wi-Fi option.

United Airlines started offering free in-flight connectivity through Starlink in 2025. Delta Air Lines also has free Wi-Fi on most of its domestic and international flights.

American’s Premium Push

American has also made a host of changes to its customer experience to capitalize on the premium boom that has led its competitors — Delta and United — to report record profits. Some of the other changes include bringing back champagne to business class, partnering with Italian coffee company Lavazza, and expanding business class to more routes.

American was the first U.S. carrier to debut the Airbus A321XLR, an “extra-long-range” single-aisle jet that can travel transatlantic and transcontinental routes. The new aircraft features 20 new Flagship suites — American’s business class product.

During the 2025 Skift Aviation Forum, American chief customer officer Heather Garboden said premium demand has been the most resilient. She added that American aims to increase the number of premium seats by 30% by the end of the decade and 50% across long-haul flights.

“We’ll have more free satellite-based Wi-Fi on our aircraft than any other airline in the entire world,” she said. “So while I think premium demand is kind of the focus right now, I have no doubt that whether that changes over the next decade or so or it doesn’t, we also are focused on all customers, not necessarily just premium.”","https://skift.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2K4A3209-scaled-e1715613640958.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2026-01-07 07:00:31.217116

At least twice as many employees worldwide would embrace rather than resist greater use of AI by their employers in 2026.

Customers across the globe will hold AI accountable, with four in five inclined to trust a brand less if it intentionally concealed AI use.

Global AI resilience will require a local safety net, with 98% of UAE executives believing in the importance of factoring in AI sovereignty into their 2026 business strategy.

Quantum is the next frontier, with quantum-ready organizations worldwide three times more likely to belong to multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts.

DUBAI, UAE – The IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) has unveiled Five Trends for 2026, a new report identifying the forces that will redefine competitive advantage for organizations in the UAE and around the world in the year ahead. As 2026 begins, the research shows that uncertainty isn’t slowing business down it’s accelerating transformation.

To thrive, companies are doubling down on technologies that provide speed, resilience, and insight. AI has shifted from experimental to essential, redefining decisions, roles, and customer expectations at an unprecedented pace. Enterprises are moving towards operating with AI at the core, and soon, quantum will help tackle their most complex problems.

“The findings point to a fundamental shift in how organizations are approaching growth and competitiveness in 2026,” said Shukri Eid, General Manager, IBM Gulf Levant and Pakistan. “In the UAE, leaders are accelerating decision-making, embedding AI at the core of their operations, and strengthening resilience and sovereignty across their technology environments. At the same time, there is a clear focus on building trust - with employees, customers, and partners - as AI becomes more deeply integrated into everyday business. Together, these priorities are shaping organizations that are better prepared to adapt, collaborate across ecosystems, and take advantage of emerging technologies such as quantum.”

Fast decisions turn disruption into opportunity

Of the executives surveyed in the UAE, 95% say they increasingly need to make fast decisions, and all believe the highest-stakes decisions they made in 2025 were the right ones – that’s 4% above the global average. Uncertainty can become the greatest business asset for those who embrace it, with 63% of the respondents saying economic and geopolitical volatility will create new business opportunities for their organizations in 2026. The report notes that 93% of UAE executives fear they’ll lose their edge if they can’t operate in real time.

Employees are ready to embrace AI-driven role changes

The research shows that employees no longer fear AI they want to embrace it, even if that means their roles will change significantly. Globally, 81% are confident they can keep up with new technologies, and 61% think AI makes their job less mundane and more strategic. Across all generational groups from digital natives to seasoned veterans at least twice as many employees would welcome rather than resist greater use of AI by their employers in 2026. In addition, 63% would work with an AI agent.

Consumers are excited about AI, but transparency is mandatory

While consumers don’t need AI to be flawless, they do need to be in the loop. Easy-to-understand explanations of how AI is using their data are what make consumers most comfortable engaging with it. Among the consumers surveyed worldwide, 89% want to know when they’re interacting with AI, and four in five say they would trust a brand less if it intentionally concealed AI use. Two-thirds would switch brands – and half would even pay more – to avoid hidden AI. Meanwhile, 95% of global executives believe consumer trust in their AI will define the success of new products and services.

AI resilience and sovereignty become essential

In the face of growing uncertainty, AI resilience and sovereignty – an organization’s ability to control and govern its AI systems, data, and infrastructure at all times – have become mission-critical. In the UAE, 98% of executives say AI resilience and sovereignty must be part of their 2026 strategy, and 63% worry about overdependence on compute resources.

Quantum will require deep ecosystem collaboration

Quantum demands resources no single entity can realistically maintain alone in short, it takes an ecosystem, or several. Quantum-ready organizations (QROs) worldwide are three times more likely to participate in multiple ecosystems than their least ready counterparts. In the UAE, four in five executives (80%) say ecosystem partners help accelerate technology adoption, while 88% believe these partners enable their company to limit the impact of disruption, and an equal number agree that partner data improves business outcomes. The findings indicate that enterprises forging the best ecosystem alliances today are positioning themselves to lead in the quantum era.

With Delta’s exit from the direct New York service, Brussels Airlines will once again become the sole operator of nonstop flights between Brussels and JFK, while United will continue to serve the market from Newark.
Perspective and future outlook The end of Delta’s Brussels–New York nonstop service marks a symbolic shift in transatlantic aviation.","Delta Air Lines is discontinuing its non-stop flights between Brussels Airport (BRU) and New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), bringing to a close more than three decades of continuous service on one of its longest-standing transatlantic routes. The final departure from New York took place on January 5, 2026, with the last return flight from Brussels on January 6.

The last flight DL141 from Brussels to New York JFK was operated by Boeing 767-332(ER) registered N196DN. It took off at 12:34 (UTC+1) instead of its scheduled time of departure at 11:00, due to weather conditions in Brussels. The estimated arrival time at JFK is 14:20 (UTC-5), only half an hour late.

Short History of the Route

The Brussels–New York service was inaugurated in December 1991, with Delta operating Airbus A310 equipment on a daily basis, marking the beginning of its direct link between the Belgian capital and the United States. Over the years, the carrier updated the route with larger wide-body aircraft such as the Boeing 767-300ER, cementing its role as a key transatlantic connection. This service played a crucial role not only in leisure travel but also significantly for diplomatic and business traffic, given Brussels’ role as the seat of the European Union and NATO.

Like many international routes, the service was temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2022) but was restored as travel demand recovered, operating four weekly flights in recent seasons.

Strategic shift: From New York to Atlanta

Delta’s decision to end the JFK–Brussels service is part of a broader network realignment intended to strengthen its transatlantic operations and optimise profitability. Instead of serving Belgium from New York year-round, the airline is shifting focus to its major hub at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). Beginning March 8, 2026, Delta will expand its Atlanta–Brussels schedule, initially with four weekly flights before moving to daily service during the peak travel season.

Delta’s executives have indicated that the shift reflects changes in market demand, especially in fare-sensitive economy cabins, and greater strategic value in feeding Brussels traffic through Atlanta’s extensive domestic and international connecting network.

For passengers based in the New York area, this move means the loss of a direct flight option to Brussels on Delta; travellers will instead have to connect via Atlanta or opt for other carriers.

Competitive landscape on the Brussels–New York Corridor

The competitive environment on the Brussels–New York corridor has been a persistent strategic challenge for Delta:

Brussels Airlines: As Belgium’s flag carrier and a member of the Star Alliance (via the Lufthansa Group), Brussels Airlines operates daily direct service between Brussels and New York-JFK, typically using Airbus A330-300 aircraft. Its strong local brand and alliance connectivity have made it a dominant player on this route.

United Airlines: A major U.S. competitor, United operates daily non-stop flights from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to Brussels, diversifying connections to the U.S. East Coast and beyond.

Delta’s Position: Unlike in other European markets such as Amsterdam or Paris, Delta does not have a joint-venture partner in Brussels, limiting its access to broader connecting traffic flows that alliance partners can provide. This has historically constrained Delta’s ability to capture a larger share of connecting travellers beyond point-to-point passengers.

With Delta’s exit from the direct New York service, Brussels Airlines will once again become the sole operator of nonstop flights between Brussels and JFK, while United will continue to serve the market from Newark.

Wider market and strategic implications

This route termination should be understood in the context of broader shifts in transatlantic aviation:

Open Skies Framework: Under the EU–US Open Skies Agreement, carriers from EU and U.S. countries can freely operate transatlantic services. While this has fostered competition, it also subjects airlines to intense fare pressure and the need for scale and alliances to sustain profitability.

Delta’s Network Optimisation: By focusing on Atlanta—where Delta controls a large share of connecting flows and has strong joint-venture partnerships with Air France–KLM and Virgin Atlantic—the airline aims to leverage its hub strength to better serve European markets, including Belgium.

Alliance Dynamics: The absence of a SkyTeam partner based in Brussels contrasts with Star Alliance’s integrated position via Brussels Airlines and United, illustrating how alliance networks shape competitive advantage on transatlantic routes.

Perspective and future outlook

The end of Delta’s Brussels–New York nonstop service marks a symbolic shift in transatlantic aviation. For Brussels, travellers and businesses lose a legacy direct link that has operated for 34 years. However, the market will remain well-served by alliance and incumbent carriers, and connectivity to the United States continues through diversified gateways.

For Delta, the strategic choice to channel Brussels traffic through Atlanta reflects a prioritisation of hub connectivity and network efficiency in a competitive global air travel market. How this strategy will perform in the medium term will depend on consumer demand for seamless connections, competitive responses from other carriers, and evolving alliance structures.",https://www.aviation24.be/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Delta_Air_Lines_B767-332_N1611B_Brussels_Airport_25L.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:59:18.962581

Nvidia’s new Vera Rubin architecture was launched earlier than expected at CES, joined by announcements for its own Tesla-rivaling self-driving car technology, and the latest updates coming to DLSS, G-Sync display tech, and the GeForce Now cloud gaming platform.

While none of these hold quite the same appeal as a new generation of consumer graphics cards — something we might see at CES 2027, following the RTX 50-series launch last year — it can still be a lot to parse, especially through the vast slurry of everything else being promoted at the giant Consumer Electronics Show. We’ve rounded up the most significant announcements that Nvidia has made so far to help you stay on top of the news.

Vera Rubin ‘AI supercomputer’

Nvidia launched the Vera Rubin platform during its CES keynote, its next-generation successor to the Blackwell architecture that’s currently used in its most powerful AI chips. Nvidia says this new architecture, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, can train large “mixture of experts” (MoE) AI models as quickly as Blackwell, but with far greater efficiency. Dion Harris, Nvidia’s senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as “six chips that make one AI supercomputer,” which include the Vera CPU, Rubin GPU, NVLink 6th-gen switch, Connect-X9 NIC, BlueField4 DPU, and Spectrum-X 102.4T CPO.

Autonomous driving solutions

Nvidia is racing against Tesla and Waymo to build technology that will allow cars to fully drive themselves without human assistance, and it may now have the edge. Alpamayo, a newly announced portfolio of AI models, simulation blueprints, and datasets, can give vehicles level 4 autonomy — allowing them to fully drive themselves under specific conditions. “Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes, and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the presentation.

The first passenger car that will be available with this tech is the new Mercedes-Benz CLA, with AI-assisted driving features coming to the US this year. Nvidia’s answer to Full Self-Driving is impressive, according to my colleague Andrew J. Hawkins, who took it for a test-drive, and says that Tesla should be concerned.

DLSS 4.5 is here

The next major update to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) feature is now available for all RTX GPUs, providing improvements to image quality and fewer artifacts compared to DLSS 4. This DLSS 4.5 update includes Nvidia’s second-generation Super Resolution transformer model and is supported across more than 400 games and apps via Nvidia’s app.

This is the technology that allows supported games to be played at higher resolutions without compromising frame rates, a valuable feature for PC gamers with older Nvidia RTX graphics cards in their systems. Those with newer GPUs will see greater benefits from DLSS 4.5, however: it will run faster on RTX 40- and 50-series cards and provides a 6x Multi Frame Generation mode for RTX 50-series GPUs that generates up to five additional frames for every frame rendered.

GeForce Now is coming to Linux and Fire TV

Nvidia is planning to launch native GeForce Now apps for Linux and Amazon’s Fire TV devices in the coming months, giving more people who may not have adequate gaming hardware access to the cloud streaming service. The first beta will be available for the Ubuntu 24.04 Linux distro, before expanding to additional distributions in the coming weeks. A GeForce Now app for Fire TV Stick 4K Plus and 4K Max is expected to launch early this year. Nvidia is also introducing full flight control support for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 in GeForce Now, allowing joysticks and yokes from Thrustmaster and Logitech to work on the cloud gaming service.

New G-Sync monitors

A new set of G-Sync Pulsar monitors is launching on January 7th that use a built-in light sensor to automatically adjust brightness and color based on your room lighting. Each model is a 27-inch IPS display running at 1440p and up to 360Hz refresh rate, with prices starting at $599.

“In bright daylight conditions, it increases brightness and shifts to a color that’s cooler in temperature,” says Michael McSorley, product marketing manager at Nvidia, in a briefing with The Verge. “At night, or in darker rooms, it reduces brightness and uses warmer tones to minimize glare and eyestrain.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-153250.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.8395719693116%2C100%2C92.320856061377&w=1200,N,,2026-01-06 20:00:53.733164

The exclusive data and analysis provides shippers and carriers a composite view of truck freight costs, including average-per-mile contract, spot and fuel rates.

The first publication of the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index – Rates Edition revealed that spot rates jumped 3.0% in October before falling 1.1% to $1.65 per mile in November. Contract rates have held steady in recent months and were at $2.02 in November. Both spot and contract rates are up less than 1% when compared with a year earlier.

Fuel surcharges, meanwhile, jumped 7.5% in November due to refinery outages. The report noted that “national diesel prices dropped that month … a reminder that fuel surcharges don’t always track pump prices in real time.”

“Our collaboration with DAT Freight & Analytics is about building on the insights we can deliver to shippers and carriers so they can make better business decisions,” said Jeff Pape, General Manager of U.S. Bank Freight Payment. “In addition to the volume and spend data and analysis included in our Freight Payments Index, we know our clients will value the spot, contract and fuel rates in this additional report.”

“The freight market is rarely one-dimensional, and looking at financial or rate data in isolation only tells half the story,” said Ken Adamo, GM, Shipper and Chief of Analytics at DAT. “By layering DAT’s benchmark analytics on top of transaction volume from U.S. Bank, we’re helping shippers bridge the gap between settlement data and real-time market dynamics. This composite view moves the industry beyond simple observation to actionable intelligence, ensuring stakeholders can anticipate volatility rather than just reacting to it.”

The new research complements the U.S. Bank Freight Payment Index, which the bank has published quarterly since 2017. The Index measures quantitative changes in freight shipments and spend activity based on data from transactions processed through U.S. Bank Freight Payment, which processes more than $43 billion in freight payments annually.

6100 Waterford District Drive

The Canadian fast-food holding company will take the entire second floor at 6100 Waterford District Drive, spanning 43K SF, from L'Oréal, Bisnow has learned.

The lease was first made public in Savills' fourth-quarter office report, and an RBI spokesperson confirmed the deal in a statement Tuesday.

RBI's new office space is within the 250-acre Waterford Business District. It represents an expansion in the sprawling office park — the company's corporate headquarters and Burger King's corporate office are located at 5707 Waterford Drive. RBI also has corporate offices in Toronto, Singapore and Zug, Switzerland.

“As we continue to grow our business in the US and globally, we are expanding our restaurant support centers in Miami to allow each of Burger King and Popeyes to have dedicated space — just down the street from each other,” an RBI representative said in a statement.

The spokesperson added that RBI plans to renovate the space.

The space used to serve as the headquarters of Parbel, a perfume and cosmetics subsidiary of L’Oréal. The company renewed its lease at the four-story, 163K SF office in 2019, Commercial Search reported at the time.

The lease term ends in August 2027, according to a JLL marketing brochure provided to Bisnow. The space has 233 workstations, 31 collaboration rooms and 10 open collaboration areas, according to the brochure.

L’Oréal did not respond to a request for comment.

JLL brokers Ryan Levy and Iker Belauste, who represented L’Oréal in the deal, declined to comment. Colliers' Jonathan Kingsley, who represented RBI in the deal, also declined to comment.

While it was unclear when the cosmetics company began marketing the space, the deal was one of the largest signed in the last quarter of 2025, according to Savills.

Roib Waterford LLC acquired the office building in 2021, along with two neighboring office buildings at 6303 Blue Waterford District Drive and 6505 Waterford District Drive, from MetLife for $110M, according to records provided by Vizzda.

The LLC is registered to Reggie Bell and Rajib Das. Bell, who is CEO of real estate investment company RealOp, and Das, CEO of merchant bank Lexington Park Group, didn't respond to requests for comment.

While Brickell, Wynwood and Miami Beach have captured much of the attention in Miami's office market, the area surrounding Miami International Airport has emerged as a budget option for companies.

Summary and Investor Outlook Eli Lilly’s 2026 strategy represents a bold bet on the industrialization of weight loss.
The combination of a $1 trillion valuation, a massive manufacturing ""moat,"" and a looming oral drug launch positions Lilly as the definitive leader of the obesity market.","As of January 6, 2026, the landscape of the pharmaceutical industry has been fundamentally reshaped by Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY), which recently became the first healthcare entity to surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization. This historic milestone is not merely a reflection of past successes but a validation of the company’s aggressive 2026 strategic pivot: a decisive shift from ""scarcity economics"" to ""access economics."" By prioritizing massive volume growth over high per-unit pricing, Lilly is attempting to saturate the global obesity market and squeeze out competitors before they can achieve meaningful scale.

The immediate implications of this strategy are already being felt across the healthcare continuum. With the launch of a new ""vial-first"" distribution model and the imminent regulatory decision for its oral GLP-1, orforglipron, Lilly is moving to capture the millions of patients previously sidelined by high costs or needle phobia. This ""volume-led"" approach signals the end of the early-adoption phase of the obesity gold rush, transitioning instead into a mature, high-output industrial race where manufacturing capacity and distribution reach are the primary determinants of victory.

The Strategy of Scale: Vials, Vouchers, and Volume

The core of Eli Lilly’s 2026 playbook is a transition that analysts have dubbed ""The Great Scaling."" For the past two years, the narrative surrounding Zepbound (tirzepatide) was dominated by shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks. However, following a staggering $50 billion multi-year investment in manufacturing, Lilly entered 2026 with a ""supply chain moat"" that its rivals are struggling to bridge. New high-capacity facilities in Indiana, North Carolina, and a massive $6.5 billion API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) plant in Texas have finally reached operational maturity, allowing the company to move away from the complex autoinjector pens that previously limited supply.

A critical component of this volume surge is the aggressive expansion of the LillyDirect platform. In a move that sent shockwaves through the industry in late 2025, Lilly slashed the self-pay price for Zepbound vials to between $299 and $350 per month. This pricing strategy is specifically designed to dismantle the gray market of compounded weight-loss drugs and to make the therapy accessible to the middle-class ""cash-pay"" segment. Furthermore, Lilly is preparing for the April 1, 2026, launch of a landmark Medicare Part D pilot program, which will provide a structured pathway for millions of seniors to access obesity medications through negotiated government rates—a move that was unthinkable just 24 months ago.

The strategic focus has also shifted toward the ""oral wave."" Eli Lilly’s once-daily pill, orforglipron, is currently under priority review with an FDA decision expected by March 2026. Unlike injectable biologics, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug, making it significantly cheaper and faster to produce at scale. By positioning this pill as a ""maintenance therapy"" for patients who have reached their goal weight on injectables, Lilly is creating a lifelong treatment loop that prioritizes long-term patient retention over one-time high-margin sales.

Winners and Losers in the New Obesity Economy

The primary beneficiary of this strategy, thus far, has been Eli Lilly itself, as it currently commands a 71% share of new U.S. obesity prescriptions. However, the shift to volume-led growth is creating a polarized environment for other players. Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) remains the most formidable challenger, having launched its own oral Wegovy pill in early January 2026 with a disruptive $149 ""starter price."" While Novo remains a ""winner"" in terms of clinical reputation, it is currently locked in a brutal price war with Lilly that is compressing margins across the sector, forcing both giants to rely on sheer scale to maintain profit growth.

On the other side of the ledger, the ""losers"" in 2026 appear to be the mid-tier biotech firms and compounding pharmacies. Compounding pharmacies, which thrived during the 2024–2025 shortage era, are seeing their business models evaporate as Lilly’s official vial prices drop to near-parity with compounded versions. Meanwhile, companies like Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) find themselves in a high-stakes waiting game. Amgen’s MariTide, a monthly injectable currently in Phase 3, is being marketed as a convenience play, but it faces a market that may already be saturated by Lilly’s daily pills and low-cost vials by the time it reaches commercialization in 2027.

Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VKTX) remains a ""wildcard"" winner. Despite the massive scale of the ""Big Two,"" Viking’s VK2735 has demonstrated clinical efficacy that may exceed Zepbound. In the 2026 market, Viking has become the ultimate acquisition target for a large-cap pharmaceutical company—such as Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) or Roche (OTC:RHHBY)—desperate to enter the space with a ""best-in-class"" asset to challenge the Lilly-Novo duopoly.

Broad Industry Trends and the ""Oral Revolution""

The shift toward volume reflects a broader trend in the pharmaceutical industry: the ""commoditization of miracles."" As obesity drugs move from niche luxury treatments to standard-of-care primary care medications, the industry is witnessing a shift in regulatory and policy focus. The 2026 Medicare pilot program is a watershed moment, suggesting that the U.S. government now views obesity treatment as a long-term cost-saving measure for the healthcare system rather than a discretionary expense. This sets a historical precedent similar to the rollout of statins in the 1990s, where high-volume, lower-margin distribution eventually led to massive cumulative profits and improved public health outcomes.

Furthermore, the ""oral revolution"" led by orforglipron and oral Wegovy is removing the final barrier to mass adoption: the ""needle phobia"" factor. By mid-2026, it is expected that nearly 40% of new obesity starts will be for oral medications. This transition is forcing a massive reconfiguration of the pharmaceutical supply chain, moving away from specialized cold-chain logistics required for biologics and toward the traditional pill-and-bottle distribution that has dominated the industry for a century. This shift also has significant ripple effects on pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who are being pressured by both Lilly and the government to pass through more of the volume-based discounts directly to consumers.

The Road Ahead: From 2026 to the ""Triple G"" Era

Looking toward the second half of 2026 and into 2027, the market is bracing for the next technological leap. While orforglipron and Zepbound drive volume today, Lilly is already preparing the ground for Retatrutide, its ""Triple G"" agonist (GLP-1, GIP, and Glucagon). Phase 3 results for Retatrutide are expected to trickle out throughout 2026, potentially setting a new ceiling for weight loss at 25% or higher. The challenge for Lilly will be managing its own internal competition: ensuring that Retatrutide can be positioned as a premium ""high-efficacy"" tier while orforglipron handles the mass-market ""maintenance"" tier.

In the short term, the market will be hyper-focused on the Q1 and Q2 2026 earnings reports to see if the ""volume-led"" strategy is actually translating into bottom-line growth. There is a risk that the aggressive price cuts through LillyDirect and the low-cost Medicare deals could temporarily suppress margins before the full effect of the manufacturing scale-up kicks in. Investors will also be watching for any potential ""rebound effect"" data—long-term studies on what happens when patients transition from injectables to orforglipron pills—as this will determine the sustainability of Lilly’s ""lifelong patient"" model.

Summary and Investor Outlook

Eli Lilly’s 2026 strategy represents a bold bet on the industrialization of weight loss. By pivoting from a model of high-priced scarcity to one of high-volume accessibility, the company is attempting to build an insurmountable lead in the most lucrative therapeutic area in medical history. The combination of a $1 trillion valuation, a massive manufacturing ""moat,"" and a looming oral drug launch positions Lilly as the definitive leader of the obesity market.

For investors, the coming months are critical. The key metrics to watch are not just ""total revenue,"" but ""total prescriptions (TRx)"" and ""manufacturing yield."" If Lilly can successfully transition millions of patients to its oral platform while maintaining its 70%+ share of the injectable market, the $1 trillion market cap may only be the beginning. However, the ongoing price war with Novo Nordisk and the clinical progress of high-efficacy challengers like Viking Therapeutics ensure that while Lilly is currently the king of the mountain, the terrain remains as volatile as ever.

""It's minimal enough that you're not going to see a Ukraine-Russia style response. A big reason for that sell-off was the huge spike in oil prices.

Three of America’s leading companies can make a big difference for bees.
Walmart As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart can make a big difference by phasing out neonics.
We’re keeping up the momentum next year, continuing to call on Walmart to take steps to protect bees.
Home Depot Lastly, Home Depot could become a key part of the work to protect pollinators.","Across the country, bees and other pollinators are struggling. There are three major corporations that have the power to protect them.

Toxic pesticides, habitat loss and industrial farming practices have all contributed to steep die-offs among the insects that help everything from our backyard gardens to major crop harvests bloom.

And while some states are starting to limit the use of neonicotinoids — some of the most harmful pesticides for bees — millions of pounds of these chemicals are still widely available, and end up entering our environment every year.

That’s why Environment America and our national network are working to change the way major companies sell, and consumers use, these pesticides to help turn the tide for bees.

Three of America’s leading companies can make a big difference for bees.

1. Walmart

As the world’s largest retailer, Walmart can make a big difference by phasing out neonics. Neonics attack the brains and bodies of bees and other insects, weakening them and making it more difficult for them to fly, navigate and gather food.

Walmart’s stores are located in nearly every corner of the nation, making the company an influential factor in what pesticides end up on shelves and in gardens. This year, thousands of our members and supporters raised their voices and urged the company to take the next step in phasing out neonics and promoting pollinator-safe alternatives.

We’re keeping up the momentum next year, continuing to call on Walmart to take steps to protect bees.

2. Amazon

Similarly, we’re urging Amazon, the nation’s biggest online marketplace, to stop selling neonic-containing products. With so many shoppers across the nation relying on Amazon for garden supplies, getting these harmful products off Amazon’s websites would likely meaningfully reduce the everyday use of neonics.

3. Home Depot

Lastly, Home Depot could become a key part of the work to protect pollinators. As one of the country’s largest home and garden retailers, the company plays a massive role in what products Americans bring back to their gardens, lawns and flower beds.

Yet despite their negative impact, neonic products can still be found on Home Depot’s shelves. This fall, our supporters added their names to petitions calling on the company to stop neonic sales, all while helping build support and attention around the need for safer, bee-friendly alternatives.

We’re making progress for the bees

As word continues to spread about the dangers and potential impact neonics are having on our pollinators and ecosystems, these companies can follow the lead of states that already are taking action.

Massachusetts, New York, California, Minnesota and others are beginning to restrict the use and sale of neonic pesticides. Meanwhile two states, New York and Vermont have restricted the use of neonic-coated seeds, which are currently used on about 70-80% of all U.S. grown corn, soy and cotton.

But we have to keep calling on influential companies to do the right thing, too. That’s where you come in.

You can help defend bees from dangerous pesticides

From getting neonics off store shelves, to campaigning for stronger regulations on farm and state land, we’re doing everything we can to protect our struggling bees and butterflies.

It’s your dedication that powers every bit of this work. Together, our government, corporate leaders and citizens like you can make America’s gardens, farms and wild places safer for bees and the countless other species that depend on them.

We need your support to urge corporations like Walmart, Amazon and Home Depot to stop selling bee-killing neonic pesticides.

North America’s leading online retailers changed up varying aspects of their executive leadership teams, many of them bringing in new CEOs or hiring technology leaders to navigate an artificial intelligence (AI)-dominated retail environment in 2025.

In the online marketplace arena, eBay brought in a new chief financial officer. It brought in Peggy Alford, who is a board member at Meta and was previously executive vice president of global sales and merchant services for PayPal. Meanwhile, Etsy’s chief technology officer, Rafe Colburn, took on an expanded role. As a result, he became Etsy’s chief product and technology officer. The change came as Etsy’s previous chief product officer departed and the online marketplace consolidated the two executive roles.

Elsewhere, BigCommerce (now simply called Commerce), which powers ecommerce platforms for some of the Top 2000 online retailers, named a new product officer. DHL Supply Chain named a new CEO for its North America unit, and FedEx brought in a new chief digital and information officer (CDIO).

These changes and more highlight varying priorities in a retail macroenvironment that includes:

Shifts in consumer spending as a result of tariffs and other price increases.

AI’s expansion into agentic commerce and other year-defining ecommerce trends.

The rise of retail media networks as key marketing tools.

Mergers and acquisitions, as well as bankruptcies.

Expanded last-mile delivery partnerships.

Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar raised Agilent’s price target to $160.00, up from the previous $155.00, reflecting a more optimistic outlook for the company’s future. This positive reassessment comes on the heels of several favorable ratings from other financial institutions, signaling growing confidence in Agilent’s trajectory and strengthening market sentiment.

After the initial surge, Agilent’s shares settled at $147.85, marking a 3.4% gain compared to the previous closing price.

Curious if this is a good moment to invest in Agilent?

Market Reaction and Historical Context

Agilent’s stock typically experiences limited volatility, with only nine instances of price swings greater than 5% over the past year. Today’s movement suggests that investors view the recent news as significant, even if it may not fundamentally alter perceptions of the business.

One of the most notable price increases in the last year occurred eight months ago, when Agilent’s shares climbed 7.8%. This rally coincided with major U.S. indices rising (Nasdaq up 3.4%, S&P 500 up 2.5%) after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily pause certain tariffs for 90 days, hinting at a possible easing of trade tensions.

This agreement reduced U.S. tariffs on Chinese products to 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 10%, providing companies with some relief to adjust inventories and supply chains. However, President Trump warned that tariffs could increase further if a comprehensive deal wasn’t reached within the 90-day window, though not to previous highs. The truce helped calm fears of a prolonged trade conflict, supporting global growth expectations and boosting optimism, especially in sectors sensitive to trade such as technology, retail, and industrials.

Since the start of the year, Agilent’s stock has gained 7.2%. At $147.85 per share, it is trading near its 52-week peak of $157.20, reached in November 2025. For perspective, an investor who purchased $1,000 worth of Agilent shares five years ago would now see that investment grow to $1,203.

By Scott Hamilton

Jan. 6, 2026, © Leeham News: Airbus is tweaking the marketing messaging for the A220 to boost sales for regional airline operations.

Marketing for the A220 began as the C Series when Bombardier launched the program in 2008. Bombardier positioned the 100-seat CS100 as a replacement for the Airbus A318 and Boeing 737-500/600. The 130-seat CS300 was designed to replace the Airbus A319 and Boeing 737-700. The Airbus and Boeing airplanes are considered mainline aircraft as opposed to regional airliners.

Bombardier also design a larger CS500, but didn’t launch the program. The CS500 would be a direct competitor to the A320 and 737-800/8.

Airbus continued this marketing approach when it agreed to purchase control of the C Series program in 2017, renaming it the A220-100 and A220-300. Airbus says it’s a matter of when, not if, it will proceed with the A220-500.

However, at an event hosted by the European Regional Airlines Association, Airbus told regional carriers the A220 is a choice airplane for them if they have ambitions to spread their wings, so to speak.

Benjamin Peiron, VP Single Aisle Marketing for Airbus, told LNA in an interview last month that this message didn’t represent a shift in marketing strategy. “It's more focused, I would say. If we look at the operator base of A220, it's about half composed of legacy carriers, [like] Air France, Delta, Air Canada. About one third is from so-called regional airlines, whatever the exact definition is. The rest is hybrid low-cost or equivalent.”",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LNA-Outlook-2026.png,N,,2026-01-06 20:00:49.388365

On Tuesday, William Blair raised its rating on Medtronic Plc (NYSE: MDT), pointing to a series of recent and upcoming product launches as key factors behind the decision.

The firm shifted its outlook from Market Perform to Outperform. Analyst Brandon Vazquez explained that the previous rating was based on Medtronic’s significant size and lack of distinctiveness, which made it difficult for the company to consistently achieve robust, high single-digit earnings growth.

Medtronic is actively introducing several innovative products, with a strong pipeline suggesting more launches on the horizon.

Medtronic’s Strategic Shift: Signs of a New Era

Should Medtronic succeed in reaching high single-digit EPS growth, the company could potentially offer shareholders a low double-digit return, especially when factoring in its 2.9% dividend yield.

According to Vazquez, “With shares trading at about 16 times projected 2026 earnings, Medtronic is valued at or slightly below its large-cap medical technology peers, presenting an attractive risk/reward profile as the company’s outlook improves.”

The Hugo robotic system, which has been anticipated for nearly ten years, recently received FDA clearance for urologic surgeries in the U.S., marking a significant milestone with a clearer timeline for rollout.

This development could mark a pivotal moment for Medtronic’s surgical division, which contributed 19% of the company’s 2025 revenue but has trailed overall corporate growth over the past five years.

William Blair also noted that the Symplicity Spyral RDN system achieved a crucial commercialization milestone in late 2025, following final CMS national coverage approval. Management views this decision as more favorable than the initial draft, ensuring broader patient access.

While revenue growth is expected to be gradual due to the complex clinical landscape, the CMS reimbursement enhances visibility and positions the RDN system to start making a meaningful financial impact.

Why Medtronic Stands Out for Investors

Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) continues to be one of Medtronic’s most rapidly expanding segments, helping to offset slower progress in traditional pacing and defibrillation markets.

The PFA platform bolsters Medtronic’s standing in the atrial fibrillation space by stabilizing market share, opening opportunities for incremental gains, and increasing exposure to the growing AF ablation market as adoption accelerates. This expansion also offers the potential for improved profit margins as volumes rise.

Vazquez commented, “The planned diabetes business spin-off is a win for both entities—MiniMed can focus on becoming a leader in diabetes care, while Medtronic can channel resources into its primary growth areas.”

MDT Stock Performance: At the time of reporting on Tuesday, Medtronic shares had climbed 2.91% to $98.05.

STAAR now has a renewed opportunity to truly shine.” Now that the deal seems likely to fall through, analysts are left asking what comes next for Staar.","Shareholders of Staar Surgical, a manufacturer of the Implantable Collamer Lens, have likely definitively voted against Alcon’s $1.6 billion buyout offer.

Broadwood Partners, which holds 30.2% of Staar’s common shares, has been vocally opposed to the deal since it first became public in October, arguing that the deal would have undervalued the business and reflected a flawed sales process.

The final vote was held on January 6, after having been originally scheduled for October and moved four times since.

Originally, Alcon and Staar’s boards of directors both unanimously supported the transaction, but Staar sent several appeals to its board cautioning against the deal.

Previously, Alcon and Staar were major competitors in the eyecare space, both specializing in the manufacturing of vision-related medical devices.

In December, Alcon upped its bid from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, with the new offer valuing the company’s worth at $30.75 per share in cash, as opposed to the previous $28 per share. Under new terms, Alcon has also lowered promised payouts for Staar executives if the deal closes.

“This best and final offer to the Staar stockholders offers a clear choice: a substantial and certain premium versus an uncertain future,” Alcon said in a prepared statement.

Prior to the acquisition, Staar was having a difficult year financially. In May, the company withdrew its 2025 guidance that was announced in February, citing global economic uncertainty and tariff policy conditions.

Staar reported net sales of $42.6 million for 1Q25 compared to $77.4 million in the prior year quarter, pointing to a significant decline in China revenue.

BTIG analysts have recommended that Staar take the new, $1.6 billion offer, writing that the company’s “shares are likely to meaningfully suffer if the deal is not consummated.” On the day of the $1.6 billion offer announcement, Staar shares rose 13.7%.

In October, Staar was able to participate in a “go-shop” period, in which the company allegedly met with 21 other parties but did not receive a single offer.

On December 12, Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, reaffirmed its recommendation that shareholders of Staar should vote “AGAINST” the proposed acquisition by Alcon.

December 17, Broadwood wrote a letter to the board, appealing to its members to vote against the acquisition.

“Since the announcement of STAAR’s proposed sale to Alcon in August, we have been engaged in a spirited debate with you over the Company’s prospects and the merits of the proposed deal. As you know, we have felt from the start that this transaction materially undervalues STAAR and was the product of a deeply flawed process undertaken at the wrong time in STAAR’s history,” the investment firm wrote in a prepared statement.

“As we approach the thrice-delayed special meeting of shareholders, we are confident our fellow shareholders will agree with us and reject this ill-advised transaction. Several large shareholders, all three proxy advisory firms and at least one of the Company’s own directors have rightly expressed great skepticism about the process, timing and price of the proposed deal.”

Based on preliminary results, this deal will not go through; something that Neal C. Bradsher, Broadwood Founder and President, is thanking the board for publicly.

“We thank our fellow shareholders for their attention during this process and for rejecting the proposed acquisition of STAAR by Alcon at today’s Special Meeting. We appreciate that so many shareholders recognize the value of STAAR and share our enthusiasm for the Company’s bright future,” Bradsher said in a prepared statement following the vote.

“It is now time to focus on the road ahead. With its leading technology, strong financial position, privileged position in large markets, and clear path to growth and profit margin expansion in both the near term and the long term, STAAR’s future is bright. As STAAR’s largest shareholder, we are confident in the Company’s standalone prospects and committed to helping STAAR realize its abundant potential for the benefit of all shareholders.

To that end, we are ready and willing to work collaboratively with the Board and our fellow shareholders to implement the necessary changes to enable effective oversight and execution on STAAR’s opportunity to become a highly profitable and scaled enterprise. STAAR now has a renewed opportunity to truly shine.”

Now that the deal seems likely to fall through, analysts are left asking what comes next for Staar. Investors have signaled their intention to fight for changes to the Board and management, which analysts with BTIG believe is likely to happen.

However, analysts also believe this will hamper Staar’s ability to operate for a period of time, as it will serve as a distraction.

“Our STAA Rating is Neutral. With shareholders voting against the acquisition by Alcon (ALC, Buy, $91 PT) we believe shares are likely to remain pressured as changes to the Board and management ensue over the coming weeks and months. As a result, we see limited multiple expansion with shares trading at 2.5x NTM EV/Sales,” BTIG wrote in its report.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/blt19a657701cf7cc9a/695d681a8658fd63fd079fc1/alcon_to_use.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 18:01:09.045460

This commitment will be powered by surplus food donations and Foundation fundraising, alongside the Nourishing Neighbors program’s continued investment of $10 million annually in initiatives such as the Innovation Spark Fund, E.A.T. curriculum for students and a summer hunger coalition, all aimed at breaking the cycle of food insecurity.

As we look to the future, our focus remains clear:

Together, we will fight hunger today, build sustainable solutions for tomorrow and create lasting impact for generations to come. Here’s to an even brighter 2026!",https://s29.q4cdn.com/239956855/files/doc_news/blogs/2025/12/Image-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 18:01:04.605979

Market update : The S & P 500 is higher for the third straight session and on track to close at a record high. 2026 is off to a fast start, and the gains thus far have been broader than last year, when the AI-crazed concentrated gains in the Magnificent 7, technology, and data center, power-generating industrials. In fact, many stocks that were out of favor over the last few months of 2025 are finally catching up to the rest of the market. Some examples in the portfolio include Amazon , Costco , Eaton , Honeywell , Starbucks , Qnity Electronics , and Texas Roadhouse . Virtually nothing has changed at these companies over the past six days, so we'll see how far this rotation takes them. But we always say there's value in out-of-favor stocks when the fundamentals are positive, and sentiment is too negative. Also, one thing working in their favor is the end of the tax loss selling season, which may have kept a lid on these past underperformers. Good news for Lilly? A biotech company announced interim results from two Phase 1/2a clinical trials on Tuesday that could potentially offer a new approach to treating obesity. Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals announced that its investigational RNA interference therapeutic, in combination with Eli Lilly 's tirzepatide, doubled weight loss, improved fat reduction, and increased lean muscle tissue. This was a small sample size, so we shouldn't get too excited about this just yet, but analysts at Truist said the results are ""incrementally positive"" for Lilly, as any future commercialization of Arrowhead's drugs could increase tirzepatide sales. In addition, Truist points out that these medications wouldn't directly compete with Lilly's oral GLP-1 orforglipron, which is expected to launch in the United States sometime in the next few months. For what it's worth, Lilly is running trials of its drug, bimagrumab, which could also provide muscle-preserving benefits. Up next : There are no major earnings after the closing bell or before the opening bell on Wednesday. On the data side, we'll see weekly mortgage applications, the ISM services index, JOLTS job openings, factory orders, and durable goods orders.

William Blair upgraded from Market Perform to Outperform. Analyst Brandon Vazquez wrote that the Market Perform rating hinged on a business that was too large and not differentiated enough to durably hit its goals of delivering consistent high-single-digit EPS growth.

Medtronic is ramping up several new products, with many more in the pipeline.

Medtronic's Transformation: A Turning Point Ahead

If Medtronic is truly positioned for high-single-digit EPS growth, then the company can deliver low-double-digit equity return when factoring in a 2.9% dividend yield.

""At a valuation of roughly 16 times calendar 2026 EPS, the stock is trading in line to slightly below large-cap medtech peers, suggesting a favorable risk/reward for an improving setup,"" Vazquez added.

The Hugo system has been long-awaited for almost a decade now and has a more tangible timeline, recently announcing FDA approval for urologic surgical procedures in the U.S.

The update could be an inflection point in the company's surgical segment, which accounted for 19% of revenues in 2025 and has been growing slower than the corporate average over the past five years.

William Blair highlighted that the Symplicity Spyral RDN system reached a major commercialization inflection in late 2025 with final CMS national coverage. Management considers the decision more favorable than the draft and adequate to support broad patient access.

Investors should expect a measured revenue ramp, reflecting a long but nuanced clinical evidence base. Even so, CMS reimbursement meaningfully improves visibility and positions RDN to begin contributing to the P&L.

Why Investors Should Bet On Medtronic Now

Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) remains one of Medtronic's fastest-growing businesses and a key counterbalance to slower growth in legacy pacing and defibrillation markets.

The PFA platform strengthens Medtronic's competitive position in atrial fibrillation by supporting share stabilization with potential for modest gains, increasing exposure to a large and expanding AF ablation market as adoption rises, and offering a clear margin upside as volumes scale.

""We view the diabetes spin-off as compelling for both parties, allowing the newly formed MiniMed to focus on becoming a staple in the diabetes market and Medtronic to allocate resources toward the aforementioned growth drivers,"" analyst Vazquez wrote in an investor note on Tuesday.

MDT Price Action: Medtronic shares were up 2.91% at $98.05 at the time of publication on Tuesday, according to Benzinga Pro data.

MARK PEARSON: I think the best story we can probably tell is with our teachers’ business.
MARK PEARSON: We have all the tools available for people to actually learn and play in the sandbox, if you like.","BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. It’s early 2025 and inside Equitable Holdings, CEO Mark Pearson is asking a simple but profound question: is 80% enough? Over the past three years, the company has undergone a sweeping transformation and launched a bold experiment to reinvent how a 160-year-old financial institution collaborates, innovates, and leads. This New Way of Working is designed to speed up decision-making, empower teams, and ignite a new culture of agility. But not everyone is on board. Some divisions thrive under the new model while others cling to old habits.

As Pearson and his leadership team look ahead, they face a defining choice whether to push for total adoption or allow flexibility at the edges. This case challenges us to consider what true cultural change looks like and what it takes to make it last. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Das Narayandas and guests Mark Pearson and Jeff Hurd to discuss the case, “New WOW at Equitable, A New Way of Working.”

I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network.

Das Narayandas’ research focuses on business-to-business marketing and management of client relationships and professional service firms. Das, it’s been a while since we’ve had you on Cold Call. Welcome back.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Thank you.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. We’re really excited to have two guests in the studio today. In addition to Das, we’ve got Mark Pearson, he’s the president and CEO of Equitable Holdings. He’s joined today by Jeff Hurd, Chief Operating Officer. Both of you have lived the case so thank you for being here to talk about it with us.

JEFF HURD: We’re really happy to be here.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you very much, Brian.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s been a busy day for you, right? You came in from the classroom and you’re coming in here, so you’ve got some fresh insights as to the discussion that took place there. I think a lot of people will be able to relate to the central themes of this case because every organization is trying to figure out how to get more agile, how to be more innovative, particularly in the age of AI, where these things are coming at us fast and we’ve got to figure out how to grapple with it. And as we all know, change is hard. So, we’re going to talk about that.

Das, I’m going to start with you. Let’s just dive right in. I’m wondering what initially drew you to the case and how this story reflects larger questions about how organizations pursue cultural change, particularly in highly regulated industries, which the Equitable is. We’ll talk a little bit about their business in a moment, but why’d you write the case?

DAS NARAYANDAS: Like you said, Brian, change is hard, change is ugly, and we live in a world where change is something that has to happen all the time. So, how does one go about doing it? The reason I wrote this case is I’ve been thinking about looking at a series of firms in different industries that are trying to overcome inertia and break down barriers to remain relevant.

The metaphor I used in class today when I was teaching this case was my visit to my physician earlier this summer, and he told me that my metabolism was slowing down. I took that as a comment about my aging, but then I realized when I ChatGPT’d after the meeting about metabolism, what I found out was metabolism in human body slows down when the muscle mass decreases, which is part of aging. What my physician was telling me was, Das, if you want to stay alive, go get yourself fit by building some muscle mass. I think that’s really what organizations need to do too. You need to build the muscle to remain relevant. This case that I’ve written is trying to capture how Mark and Jeff as leaders of Equitable took 160-year-old organization and have truly made it relevant in today’s world by making it a five-year-old. They brought in new muscle, and they made existing muscle better. That is the whole idea of change management, and that’s why I wrote this case.

BRIAN KENNY: Five-year-olds can be difficult to manage, though; we know that. It’s a great metaphor.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Let’s say that what they did was build a disciplined five-year-old, if there is one.

BRIAN KENNY: Well, I’ve never met one of those before. Great. Mark, I’m going to turn to you then and ask you, I thought the metabolism thing was actually a really interesting metaphor for what you were doing here. I’m wondering if you take us back to 2018, which was the IPO when the case first kicks off, what did you observe that convinced you that Equitable needed to rethink how it worked?

MARK PEARSON: Well, one of the things with any change management is having a catalyst to change. The IPO really came to us when AXA, our parent at that time, decided that it was going to exit the U.S. market and in turn, we were going to spin off on our own. We were incredibly excited about that. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be the architect of a business rather than somebody who drove the car that somebody else had designed. So very, very excited at that. At the same time, we knew that this organization, 160-year-old, was very high integrity business, a nice business, but a very, very sleepy business. It just wasn’t fit for purpose as a listed company. We knew that we had to do three things really. Firstly, we had to change our risk philosophy, our risk profile, because our balance sheet was a different size to AXA’s.

Secondly, I had to bring in people who had operated in that listed entity world, and Jeff was the first person we hired there. And then thirdly, the way we work the culture, if you like, inside the organization, we had to speed it up. We had to be much more innovative because at the same time as this IPO, we saw those forces you were talking about in the introduction to the podcast, we saw technology coming in, we saw new competitors coming in. We saw new sophisticated ways of investing. So, the convergence of these two really was what made us very determined that we had to change the metabolism to take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that makes perfect sense. Jeff, you kind of lived it. You were one of the people who was helping to drive this change within the firm. We talk a lot at Harvard Business School about design thinking and the importance of agility. Those are abstract concepts though. I think one of the things that’s difficult is how you drive that home in a practical way so people understand what does it take to actually do this in a way that’s going to help our business? How were you able to translate those ideas to the people within the firm?

JEFF HURD: We knew we had to be better, faster, smarter, cheaper, and I think the whole organization recognized that. We had great confidence because of the studying that we had done, the visiting of other companies that these sort of time-tested methodologies were sound, and they needed to be adapted for Equitable; and maybe to use Das’s muscle analogy, we knew that to build muscle, we just had to get going.

This couldn’t stay on a piece of paper and not be implemented. So, we got going and we took our first unit in. We took that unit all the way down to the studs, started talking to them about what their mission is. They create their own mission. We walked them through how to create OKRs, which are a really, really hard thing to do. We help them organize into agile teams and to start to operate in those teams. By doing, we built a real flywheel and momentum, and people could touch and feel and experience what we had put out on a piece of paper.

BRIAN KENNY: By the way, I should have asked at the outset, Mark, maybe you can tell us just quickly the profile of Equitable, how many employees you have and the main lines of business.

MARK PEARSON: Yeah, sure. Equitable, 163 years old, now quoted on New York Stock Exchange, about 15 billion market cap. We serve about five and a half million clients across three main lines of business. Retirement business, wealth management, and asset management is what we do. In total across our two operating companies, we manage about a trillion of clients’ money.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you studied a lot of different firms and different industries. I’m wondering what made this experiment interesting. I’m thinking particularly about the fact that the industry is highly regulated, so being agile is great, being reckless is not, managing your risk profile, Mark, as you said before, why did you think this was an interesting one to focus on in particular?

DAS NARAYANDAS: I think it goes back to the question you asked earlier, Brian, when you asked Jeff, “Tell us how you got it done.” This is something that we’ve been discussing in the School for a decade now: knowing in itself is not enough. Doing and being is when and how things get crystal clear. This was an example where the concepts that we have heard of for a long time were brought together by a bunch of people. They have no issues by saying that we’ve imported ideas that others had, but what they did, which is their very own, was the mixing. To me, that was a great example that I wanted to bring to the executives that I’m teaching now who are running their own businesses, who are in a fundamental situation of fright or flight when they should actually be thinking of fight. I want to teach this case to give them a better understanding of how to stand their ground and fight, and remain competitive in a world where new competitors are showing up all the time.

BRIAN KENNY: Mark, I think there might’ve been some marketing people involved. I say that as a marketing person because you packaged this up inside the firm, you had a sort of a brand going around this, which is New Way of Working. The acronym is N-W-O-W. Do you actually say “en-WOW?”

MARK PEARSON: Yes, we do.

BRIAN KENNY: Awesome. Maybe you can talk a little bit about NWOW, what comprised it. There were five pillars that are mentioned in the case. If you can briefly describe what those are and how you packaged this in a way that people across the firm could begin to understand what it was you were trying to do.

MARK PEARSON: Thanks, Brian. It’s a package of, as Das said, tried and tested methodologies that worked for us. So, starts off with objectives and key results. I mean, we were very influenced by John Doerr’s book Measure What Matters. Secondly, adaptive leadership. Really empowering our leaders to make the decisions that they need to make in our best place to make. So really an empowerment message in there. Agile working, we had within our IT department, we saw how that worked and so we rolled it out as fast as we could. Then it was clear to us that we needed to have a segment that was dealing with redesign because over the 160 years of the existence of the company, the structures inside of the company look a little bit like a coral reef, they’re not really designed or smooth. Then we had one based around skills as well and really flattened the organization out so that instead of having 26 layers of job title, we went right down to five. So, they were the five main pillars.

BRIAN KENNY: That’s a huge challenge in any organization. Even here at Harvard Business School, we’ve got silos, and it’s always difficult to figure out a way to pull people out of the silos and think about being one team. I think clearly you’ve encountered this as well. Jeff, I’m going to come back to you and ask you what the thinking was behind the way that you designed things and how you were able to break down some of the silos and get people to come up and be part of a bigger community.

JEFF HURD: It goes back to how we implemented these with each of the units that I touched on a little bit before, but we would have a boot camp, and we’d have a group of leaders together in a particular part of the organization. And they had this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to completely redesign their organization, to create new organizational units, to open up a bunch of leadership positions for other people in their organization or elsewhere in the organization. We actually did a thing called the opportunity fairs where the leader of the group would stand up in front of the entire Equitable organization, talk about their mission, talk about why this is the place in Equitable that you want to work, and talk about these actual big leadership job openings. They were open to anybody in the company. The people who acted early in effect got first draft pick. And that built a real flywheel of people now raising their hands saying, “I want to be next, I want to be next.”

That just created excitement in the organization, allowed us to shuffle the leadership, allowed us to find gems. I know Mark and I would go to the readouts and people would be talking about their OKRs or their mission, and we’d look at each other and say, “Who is that person?” Because we would’ve never discovered them in the past, and there they were and said, This person needs a leadership role. So, it really broke a lot of the coral reef that Mark talked about before.

BRIAN KENNY: You’re making it sound easy though, and I’m sure it wasn’t easy. I’m sure there was a fair amount of skepticism as you’ll find in any organization. What was the initial reaction that you were getting from people? Was there pushback and how’d you deal with that?

MARK PEARSON: Absolutely. There’s skepticism on any change program. One of the keys we found was to find the influential skeptics and really turn them. Really takes a lot of work. You have to sit down, you have to explain why you’re doing this. You have to measure the changes that you are making. But once some of those skeptics turn, they become your best ambassadors and they really, really carry a lot of the other people. There’s no doubt although, Brian, that New Ways of Working isn’t for everybody.

The level of accountability in there, standing up every two weeks to say, “What have you done in the last sprint? How are you contributing?” May not be for everybody. So clearly, we did lose some people who weren’t attuned to that way of working. To Jeff’s point earlier, it was very interesting to watch. There became a tipping point where the skeptics then turn, there is some momentum. We see engagement going up, we see results going back. Then other departments were, when is it my turn? We reached a tipping point after a while where you could see people queuing up to get the program and be in the boot camp.

BRIAN KENNY: Das, you probably looked at similar situations in a lot of different places. I’m wondering, as you saw as an outsider looking at what Equitable was doing, how important was it to have this balance of top-down versus bottom-up? Giving people some autonomy and basically some skin in the game, I guess is one way to look at it.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Change only works when it’s both ways, top-down and bottom-up. The key to successful change is figuring out when it should be top-down and when it should be bottom-up. I wrote this case actually to have that very discussion in class, Brian. It’s not one or the other. There are things that leaders need to mandate, and there are things where you need to let people come along on their own with some encouragement, figuring out that magic mix. At the end of the day, this case is about helping managers and leaders figure out how to mix the right concoction. The ingredients are there; everyone has access to it. It’s compounding it together into something that’s a powerful medication that changes the metabolism of organizations. That’s what this case is about.

I just want to add here, the B case that goes with this case actually is the playbook. It is an interactive PDF or PowerPoint that people can use to figure out what those five pillars that you mentioned are, how it works, what the process is, how you get it done. Now, my gut and Kerry Herman, who I wrote this case with, we were discussing and when we were writing this case, we said, Ah, this company is never going to let us publish the playbook. Because that’s the secret sauce. Who would give up the secret sauce? So, he said, Anyway, let’s ask. No harm done in asking. And lo and behold, when we asked the leadership—Jeff, Mark—they say, Sure, take it. You want the functionality, keep it. Then we looked at each other and said, Why are they giving it? They’re not naive. They’re smart. What we realized was their supreme confidence in how they have done it, that they are happy for others to replicate. I’m not giving away the crown jewels in the case. I’m actually making it more interesting for people to go figure out the case because, what is it that these people do? What is this NWOW that they are so openly discussing that I can learn from and use? That’s what we’re going to be learning from doing this case in class.

BRIAN KENNY: I would imagine that telling people what you did and explaining to them how they could do it isn’t a guarantee that they’re going to be able to pull off what you pulled off. This takes a lot of work, a lot of attention to detail and a lot of bringing the culture along with you. Jeff mentioned that not everybody embraced it. Some people had to be moved out. There’s some cultural damage that happens there. How do you as a leader, Mark, think about making sure the culture doesn’t get irreparably harmed as you do this and you’re trying to bring people forward with you?

MARK PEARSON: It’s a bit of getting the balance right between honoring the past and also making sure that the company is going to be around in the future. It’s especially important for an insurance group like ours where just last year, Brian, we paid out on a policy that was taken out in 1931.

BRIAN KENNY: Oh, my goodness.

MARK PEARSON: We are a long cycle, decades-long business, so we have to honor the past and Equitable has much to do. So, we were… I don’t know, just off the top of my head, we’ve ensured 10 U.S. presidents. We were amongst the first to pay out to servicemen and servicewomen in World War II. We were there through the Depression. A very fine and honorable past, but we have to make sure that we not only survive, but thrive in the future because the promises we’re making today, we will have to pay out on decades to come. I don’t have a problem with honoring the past, but also changing for the future. And the culture really, really did need to change.

It’s interesting, Brian, if you look at the management team now, Jeff and I didn’t set out to do this, but it’s almost exactly one third of people who joined new since NWOW, one third of some of the younger people have been promoted up rapidly through NWOW, and about one third have been throughout the whole journey. So, it’s quite interesting we’ve got that mix, which I think enables us to honor that past and keep the bits of the culture that we want and also change so that we can be competitive and stay around for decades to come.

BRIAN KENNY: You’re talking about the decades-long relationship you have with your customers, which is, we haven’t talked about the customers here. Have you told them what you’re doing? How have they reacted to it if you have? Are they in favor of this or are they, oh, don’t mess with my insurance?

MARK PEARSON: I think the best story we can probably tell is with our teachers’ business. We’re very proud to serve a million educators in the U.S. We’re number one in the K-12.

BRIAN KENNY: My wife thanks you; she’s an educator.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you. You’ll know through your wife, Brian, that COVID time, everything shut on the schools. We had the worksite marketing model where our advisors would go into the school, sit on those little chairs, get a yellow pad out and help the teacher with their retirement planning. That of course, all came to a shuddering halt, and we had to dramatically change how we interacted with them. We had to go from face-to-face to digital, which Jeff and I reckon would’ve taken years and years to do if we’d have sat down and wrote out a project. But the fact that we were able to use NWOW to sit down and say, Look, we need to contact our clients here.

The most important thing for us during COVID was to pay out claims and retirement checks when our clients needed them. If you can’t get that claim or retirement check from an insurance company when a disaster has hit, why do you need an insurance company? It actually came together very, very well there. That would be an example where our clients were informed. I guess, Das in his teaching earlier on was saying, sometimes in change programs you need a little bit of luck. We totally agree with that one. We were a little bit lucky there during COVID that teachers were trying to figure out with their students how to connect. So, we fed into that debate and we were saying, hey, we want to connect with you as well. And they were open to it.

BRIAN KENNY: It’s another where we’ve heard so many silver linings that came out of that horrible situation where businesses—

MARK PEARSON: Accelerators…

BRIAN KENNY: …found new ways to do things and really spur growth. Jeff, I want to come back to you. Most firms I think I can safely say would have hired consultants to do this. They would’ve paid a lot of money to outside firms to come in and help them do it, but you chose to do it differently. I’m wondering why you made that trade-off and what you see as the benefits or drawbacks from doing that.

JEFF HURD: One of the great attributes of this leadership team, I’d say, Brian, is that they’re learning machines. We had benefited so much from reading John Doerr, reading Turn the Ship Around, visiting companies like Spark, which is a telecom company in New Zealand that adopted Agile for Grownups, visiting other companies. We did work with a consulting firm at the beginning and took a lot of knowledge from them. They helped us to figure out how to stand up the organization in the right way. We probably worked with them for about six months. But we knew that if you’re not going to get that eye roll from the organization, it has to be done with your people, you have to own it.

Really, the CEO has to own it and say, “This is ours.” So, we took one of our top talents, Hilary Menard, who used to be Mark’s chief of staff, and we said, You’re in charge of this innovation and design office. You figure out how to implement this. You tell us what resources you need to do that. And you decide whether you need consultants or not. That was a form of adaptive leadership where we didn’t tell her what to do. She decided we needed to make this our own. And she built an outstanding team to implement it.

MARK PEARSON: Brian, I think when you have change programs that are driven by consultants over the years, operating managers have learned that sooner or later the consultants will go and we can get back to normal.

BRIAN KENNY: The book goes on the shelf.

MARK PEARSON: Yeah. I think it is very important if change is going to be enduring that it is yours. Sure, use consultants to train the trainer if you like, and lift your skills up. But many, many managers who maybe don’t want to change will just simply outweigh the consultants.

BRIAN KENNY: Actually, on that point, Das, I want to come back to you for a minute because this all began at a moment of inflection for the firm. The IPO gave them the platform and the burning platform that you described before, Mark. How do you sustain that once the fire is out? Once the burning is gone, and that the firm’s doing well, do people just fall back into a mode where they kind of wait it out a little bit?

DAS NARAYANDAS: Well, that’s what you’ll learn when you discuss the case in class. I will answer your question, but I just want to reflect on something that Mark said earlier. In the spirit of continuous improvement and agile development, when we wrote the current version of the case, we consciously chose not to include a case fact that the current organization is one-third the old, one-third laterals in, and one-third coming up. We thought that that would be a good “aha” to pull out in class. But having taught the case a couple of times today, we are going to put that into the case

Mark and Jeff spent quite some time with the participants talking about what it takes to make this happen. So, yes, what do you do going ahead? is a good question, and I’ll answer that in a moment, but how do you make sure that it works in the short run? What do you do with naysayers? Skeptics can be converted, but there are cynics too. Being cynical is irrational. It’s not easy to convert that. How do you manage that? So, the case, when putting this fact in, I will be able to force students to address this question of, how do you manage those that don’t want to get on board? That’s really the question that we’re going to start with in this case discussion: is 80% good enough, or do you need to get to 100%? And how do you manage it?

I’m now answering your question: What the team has shown and what will be a C case, which you’re going to put together, is the fact that the pillars are evolving. There are existing pillars that are evolving to reflect current times. There are new pillars being added, and that’s how it remains current. That’s how it remains exciting. That’s what makes it effective for people to adopt. Great brands are consistent. They take the core promise, but they make it work in today’s world. The day this team stops innovating New Ways of Working is the day it becomes history. For now, I can tell you they’re very agile in making sure that the latest issues, the externalities in the world, are constantly being reflected in how this system is being deployed.

BRIAN KENNY: I love your answer because you started out by… Our listeners are hearing about new HBS case studies all the time, and part of the reason we do this podcast is to show people how relevant the case studies are to everyday business practice. And you just showed us that you’re innovating on the case even as you go because learning in the classroom and feeding that back into the case. So that’s a really great point.

DAS NARAYANDAS: Thank you.

BRIAN KENNY: Jeff, I wanted to ask you something about what Das just said, which is that you’ve got to keep changing the model to keep it fresh. From your vantage point, how do you know when it’s time to change something up? Are you getting a feedback loop from within the firm?

JEFF HURD: 100%. Maybe I’ll answer that in two ways. One is within each unit they’ve implemented New Ways of Working slightly differently. The core concepts are 100% adoption. We had that conversation in class, but exactly how it’s applied has to be modified a bit with the right mindset for the organization. The service center is different than the sales team is different than the product team. So, we see innovation on NWOW every time we stand up a new organization. And then what we’ve learned recently, we added another pillar called “process redesign,” and Mark talked about this coral reef that builds up after 160 years. We were hearing, because of adaptive leadership, from all sorts of different parts of our organization that this process is broken, this process isn’t working, and they actually knew how to fix it. So, we developed a methodology, or adopted a methodology, tried and true process re-engineering to go in, listened to the folks who are actually doing the process, map it out, apply digital technologies to it, and totally revamp those processes. That’s a new wedge in the NWOW wheel that we’ve added probably about six months ago.

BRIAN KENNY: So, you’ve had some time to see what the results are. I’m wondering, reflecting back, if you can tell us how do you think it’s going? What would you be looking at to call this a success three, four, five years from now?

MARK PEARSON: Looking forward, I think the one thing we can be certain of is the amount of opportunities for change that we will see will not slow down, looking at Gen AI obviously, changes in the workforce. For our business, Brian, the demographics are very, very favorable in terms of the number of Americans reaching a traditional retirement age of 65 is yet to peak. But also, we know, I think that there are some enduring principles as well. I guess looking out the things that don’t change are as important for us as how we work and what doesn’t go. I think we see Equitable as being a trusted partner. We also know that it’s a very competitive market, and we need to be relentless in our innovation, and we need to continue with NWOW to be very, very client focused on that side as well. In our business we need to have a very resilient balance sheet because we need to be around for many, many decades through ups and downs and economy. So, we see NWOW continuing to evolve, and we see a bright future, I think, for our industry and certainly for the company as long as our people remain focused on the client and focused on being a trusted advisor to that client.

BRIAN KENNY: Jeff, let me ask you, as somebody who was helping boots on the ground to lead this effort across the firm, I’m sure some of the folks that are listening to this podcast might be going through a similar kind of transformation at their own firm. Do you have any words of advice, words of caution, anything you would counsel them on?

JEFF HURD: I’d say the one thing I would emphasize is if you’re going to go through a change that’s this big and this transformational, remember that organizations don’t change, people change. So, you really have to show people what’s in it for them: How will I benefit from this change? How will I work better? Mark had a brilliant phrase that he used all the time when we talked to our organization, which is, We’re future proofing you. These are skills that you are learning. We hope you apply them at Equitable. If you pick up and go somewhere else, they’re going to stay with you for the rest of your life. There are great tools to have in your career. Actually, we found, Mark, this was probably most surprising to us, that people were applying these things like OKRs, adaptive leadership, design, thinking to their own lives outside of work.

BRIAN KENNY: Sure. I could see that.

JEFF HURD: So, if you show people what’s in it for them, they actually will change.

BRIAN KENNY: This is a question. I lied. I’m asking each of you another question. As you think about the impact of AI on your business, Mark, because you mentioned it, how are you thinking about bringing people up the learning curve on that, upskilling your own community on what AI means and how they should engage with it?

MARK PEARSON: We have all the tools available for people to actually learn and play in the sandbox, if you like. I think we’ve got something like 400 case studies we’ve looked at. I would say mainly on the productivity side at the moment. I think the next stage for us is to look at ways in which we can get out into the marketplace and make it real for us. So very excited about the opportunities that it will bring, and we are in that sort of learning and productivity improvement stage.

BRIAN KENNY: I think we’re all in that phase and trying to figure out how do we wrap our arms around it. Das, I’ve got one last question, and I’ll give this to you, which is that as you think about culture change at an organization, particularly one of this size and scale, the question that the case brings up, is 80% good enough? How do you think about that? How would you counsel a leader who’s trying to think about should they push hard for that 100% adoption, or should they be a little more flexible in that?

DAS NARAYANDAS: My answer that I gave you earlier is come to class and we will discuss. No, the reason why we have that question in the case is it’s real, but it’s also illusionary. Numbers matter, but numbers don’t finalize things. The idea of asking is 80% good enough is actually asking the question, what is good enough? When you say 100%, 100% of what? Focus not on the numbers, but focus on the effectiveness of what you get done and that will lead you to the right answer. The key here is the orientation of people. As long as you can bring people on board and they give it their best, you are on the right path. The problem is when people who get on board sit the wrong way, row in the wrong direction and don’t listen to you, having all 100% of them sitting in the boat is disastrous. That’s really what we spend 80 minutes debating or 90 minutes debating in this case as to, what does it take to create a winning organization?

BRIAN KENNY: Those are great words to end on. Das, Jeff, Mark, thanks for joining me.

MARK PEARSON: Thank you, Brian. Thank you very much.

Robotics company Nuro is leading testing of the robotaxi engineering prototypes, which are overseen by autonomous vehicle operators. Commercial service is expected to launch in the San Francisco Bay Area later in 2026.

The companies made the announcement at the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show this week, also showcasing the in-cabin experience for riders. The robotaxis will have in-vehicle visualization, showing riders the vehicle's path in real-time and displaying what the robotaxi sees. They will also feature LEDs to help riders identify the right vehicles and provide status updates.

“By combining leading expertise in electric vehicles, autonomy and ridehailing, we’re building a unique new option for affordable and scalable autonomous rides in the San Francisco Bay Area and beyond,” said Sarfraz Maredia, global head of autonomous mobility and delivery at Uber.

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.
Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate.
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss.
Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","The market expects Delta Air Lines (DAL) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 13. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

While management's discussion of business conditions on theearnings callwill mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.

This airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.55 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -16.2%.

Revenues are expected to be $15.45 billion, down 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.

Estimate Revisions Trend

The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.94% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.

Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper

Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.

Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.

Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).

How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Delta?

For Delta, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.29%.

On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.

So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Delta will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?

While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.

For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Delta would post earnings of $1.52 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.71, delivering a surprise of +12.50%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.

Bottom Line

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.

That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.

Delta doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.

However, you might be surprised to learn you'll also find a variety of this brand's food in restaurants, served in a way you may not be aware of. Restaurants can order these food products from the brand pre-made, frozen, and in bulk sizes, ready for them to prepare and serve.

Kraft Heinz has numerous brand names under its label. In addition to its popular ketchup, which we consider as one of the best Ketchup brands you can buy, it's also known for other grocery store items like mustard, mayonnaise, cream cheese, pickle relish, and more. However, Kraft Heinz also sells restaurant-style, ready-to-heat-and-serve bulk frozen foods, including soup by Heinz, Chef Francisco, Quality Chef, and True Soups; Oscar Meyer hot dogs and sausages; vegetarian Boca burgers, and more. Though many restaurant chains make your food fresh to order, the next time you enjoy a delicious chicken enchilada soup or veggie burger at your favorite restaurant chain, it may actually be a product made by Kraft Heinz.

Henry John Heinz developed the original Heinz company in 1876, and its iconic ketchup hasn't changed much since it was introduced almost 150 years ago. The company's current iteration, Kraft Heinz, was formed with the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Co. It's the fifth largest food company in the world and the third largest in North America. In addition to producing frozen food for restaurants, Kraft Heinz makes Heinz condiments in bulk and in single-serve packets for restaurant customers to use on their favorite foods. The list of Heinz products served in restaurants includes ketchup and mustard, unique BBQ-style and other flavor sauces, dressings for your salad bar, as well as individual packets, Mexican sauces and salsas, and much more.

Though the company has added numerous products to its line over the years, the ketchup you enjoy today is much like the original ketchup made in 1876, as there has been little in the way of recipe adjustments besides using corn syrup instead of sugar. After 150 years, the Heinz ketchup brand is still so popular that Kraft Heinz created a product verification system so you can tell if a restaurant's bottle of ketchup is truly a Heinz product rather than an imposter brand.",https://www.chowhound.com/img/gallery/the-classic-grocery-brand-that-sells-bulk-frozen-products-to-restaurants/l-intro-1767194324.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:13:36.419168

They learn speed from U.S. teams.
Final Thought Leading across Canada and the U.S. means more than crossing a border.","Leadership Gets Tested Across Borders

Running teams in one country is tough. Doing it in two is a whole new game.

When leaders move between Canada and the U.S., they face different markets, mindsets, and systems. What works in one place may fall flat in the other. You can’t copy and paste strategy. You have to think differently.

Cross-border leaders learn fast. They build sharper systems. They speak two business languages. They earn trust in new ways. And they gain an edge most people never get.

Similar, But Not the Same

Canada and the U.S. share a border, a language, and many business traits. But key differences matter.

In Canada, regulation is more centralized. The pace can be slower. Risk tolerance is lower. Relationships matter more before decisions get made.

In the U.S., markets move faster. Sales cycles can be shorter. Risk-taking is more common. Speed often beats perfection.

One country leans on structure. The other leans on scale.

Neither is better. But leaders have to adapt.

Strategy Must Match Culture

The U.S. rewards bold moves. New ideas. Fast pivots. That makes it a good place for testing, launching, and scaling.

Canada values thoughtfulness. Stability. Clear plans. That makes it better for long-term planning and deeper client loyalty.

If you use a U.S. style in Canada, you might sound pushy. If you use a Canadian approach in the U.S., you might lose momentum.

Cross-border leadership means knowing when to turn the dial up or down.

Regulatory Rules Shape Growth

The U.S. has state-by-state rules. Canada runs most financial services through a few big regulators. This changes how products launch and scale.

Licensing, marketing, and reporting look different. Cross-border firms need separate playbooks.

Even the investor base looks different. A 2023 BNY Mellon study showed that U.S. institutional investors allocate more to alternatives (34%) than Canadian investors (22%). That affects how you build models and pitch ideas.

Understand the legal side early. Don’t assume it works the same both ways.

Talent Expectations Vary

In Canada, teams value security, benefits, and work-life balance. In the U.S., there’s more focus on growth, compensation, and upward mobility.

Leadership has to adjust:

Feedback styles

Bonus structures

Flexibility options

Career path messaging

Good leaders know what motivates their people. Great leaders adjust their style by region.

Youssef Zohny, who built his career in both countries, noticed these patterns firsthand. “In Canada, building trust often came before doing business. In the U.S., business could start quicker—but expectations for speed and innovation were also higher.”

That mindset shift shaped how he led teams on both sides of the border.

Communication Needs Local Context

Even if the language is the same, tone and delivery matter.

In the U.S., people value clarity and confidence. In Canada, subtlety and consensus play a bigger role.

Meetings run differently. Emails read differently. Client conversations move at different speeds.

One quick tip: Cut jargon everywhere. Keep language simple. Clear. Direct. But respectful of the local style.

Use feedback loops to adjust. Ask what’s landing—and what isn’t.

Currency and Cost Matter More Than You Think

Cross-border operations come with pricing challenges. Currency shifts can cut into margins. Service costs vary.

For example:

Healthcare is employer-funded in the U.S., public in Canada

Software costs often priced in U.S. dollars

Office space is more expensive in core U.S. cities

Every budget decision must factor in exchange rates and local costs.

Even something simple like setting a salary range can get tricky fast.

Use real-time tools to track FX impact. Forecast for both directions.

Scaling Across Borders Requires Repeatable Systems

To grow across countries, your systems must scale.

Start with these:

Unified onboarding processes

Clear reporting templates

Cross-border tax tracking

Shared cloud-based tools (but with regional backups)

Time zone calendars that avoid overlap errors

Don’t assume your U.S. workflows will work in Toronto or Vancouver. Run test cases. Ask team leads for feedback.

Small process breaks become big delays at scale.

Action Steps for Cross-Border Leaders

1. Build Two Playbooks

Customize one for the U.S. and one for Canada. Include hiring, sales, compliance, and client communication.

2. Run Side-by-Side Tests

Try the same strategy in both markets. Compare the response. Adjust accordingly.

3. Map Time Zones Clearly

Block shared calendar time. Respect regional holidays. Don’t book over them.

4. Use Local Experts

Hire local legal, tax, and HR pros. Even small issues can lead to major slowdowns if missed.

5. Track FX Risk Monthly

Review how currency moves affect margins. Protect with hedging if needed.

6. Lead With Context

When launching new products or initiatives, explain the why and the where. Teams want to know how it fits the market they serve.

Real Leadership Means Learning on Both Sides

The best cross-border leaders don’t just export ideas. They import lessons.

They learn patience from Canadian teams. They learn speed from U.S. teams. They keep both cultures in the conversation.

They avoid one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, they build bridges—between systems, styles, and people.

Those lessons build stronger companies. Teams that work better. Clients who stay longer.

Cross-border leadership isn’t just about growth. It’s about insight.

Final Thought

Leading across Canada and the U.S. means more than crossing a border. It means building new habits, asking smarter questions, and making decisions that fit the map—not just the model.

Focus on what works where you are. Stay open to change. Build with context.

That’s what makes a good leader great—no matter what side of the border you’re on.",https://shawanoleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/istockphoto-1051263190-612x612-1.webp,N,,2026-01-06 15:01:13.344240

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,"" Cessot said.","From monogrammed lattes at Louis Vuitton to handbag-inspired pastries at Coach , retail stores are increasingly doubling as cafes.

It's all part of companies trying to lean into experiences.

""I've long said that the easiest way to get in the experience business is to add a cafe because it engages all five senses and it gets customers to spend more time with you,"" said Joe Pine, co-author of the Experience Economy.

As the retail landscape evolves post-pandemic, some of the early pioneers in the branded cafe concept are continuing to expand, and new entrants are entering the space.

Uniqlo brought its first coffee bar to the United States in March. It has nine locations worldwide, with the first opening in Japan in 2021.

Uniqlo's head of marketing, Nico Cessot, told CNBC that the primary reason for the cafes is to bring in more customers and enhance their shopping experience.

""The interest behind and the concept behind [it] is to make you feel at home, to be part of the brand, to feel the brand, to also spread the Japanese culture. Because we are a Japanese company,"" Cessot said. He added that New York City's Fifth Avenue store uses coffee beans imported from Japan.

Luxury brands

Recently, cafes have been particularly prevalent with designer brands.

Over the past few years, fashion house LVMH has opened a Dior cafe in Dallas and Louis Vuitton Cafe in New York. It has also remodeled the Tiffany brand's Blue Box Café. All three locations are collaborations with Michelin-starred chefs.

Source: Tiffany & Co.

Prada, which is not a part of LVMH, is also rumored to be opening a New York location in 2026. The luxury retailer opened a cafe in London in 2023 and in Singapore in 2025.

Coach, meanwhile, opened its first cafe in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2024. Since then, it has opened four in the U.S. and over a dozen more internationally.

Marcus Sanders, Coach vice president of global food and beverage, said the company is seeing double to triple digit sales at stores where it added a cafe.

""Ultimately what I see happening is there's this really cool nexus of fashion meets hospitality,"" Sanders said. ""People are excited to be able to experience their favorite brands in a different way.""

The cafe rollout is also an effort by Coach to tap into popularity with Gen Z, Sanders said, which has been the core demographic driving its cultural resurgence. The brand saw a revenue increase of 22% in its fiscal 2026 first quarter.

Standing out

While more brands are adding cafes to their stores, this trend is not a new phenomenon. Barnes and Noble and Target have both partnered with Starbucks for their in-store cafes since 1993 and 1999, respectively.

Capital One and Ralph Lauren both opened their first cafes in 2014. Capital One told CNBC that it now operates 65 cafes nationally. Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, operates over 40 cafes across the world, including in cities like London, Barcelona, Hong Kong and Singapore. Both companies are continuing to expand, with new openings planned for 2026.

Pine said Covid decimated the experience economy but that people are looking to spend their time out and about again. He noted that cafes are one of the primary ways to do that.

But as more companies jump on the trend, it will become increasingly commoditized, he said.

""It's something that you need to refresh to think about how you change this over time and you need to design it uniquely,"" Pine said. ""The Tiffany Blue Box Cafe [is] a beautiful example of that, so that it's not just about the coffee, it's about immersing you in the brand values, in the brand colors, in what it stands for.""

Coach put its own spin on the concept with pastries like the Tabby cake, an edible version of one of its best-selling handbags.

Source: Coach Inc.

At Capital One, cardholders of the namesake bank and Discover, which it acquired in a $35 billion stock deal in 2025, get half off beverage purchases.

Unlike Coach, the bank doesn't run the food and beverage operations. Capital One said its cafes are independently run by a third-party provider and it does not share in profits or losses. The bank can instead focus its efforts on how to leverage the space to increase its brand awareness.

""Bank accounts and credit cards and money are things that don't always feel tangible. And so the cafes can show up as a personification of what is Capital One,"" said Jennifer Windbeck, Capital One's head of retail bank channels.

Uniqlo said it owns and operates the majority of its cafes, including the one inside its New York City flagship location, which has a coffee bar on the second floor of the store.

Cessot said the goal was to make it a service area where guests can come pick up online orders, get their clothing repaired and customize their apparel.

""There's one aspect that is making profits, which we are obviously monitoring week over week, month over month. And then the second aspect is really about the customer. And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,"" Cessot said.

Summary

Microsoft Corporation is rated Buy, driven by strong AI and cloud momentum, robust leadership, and ambitious revenue targets.

MSFT delivered a stellar quarter with 18.4% Y/Y revenue growth, significant beats across all segments, and accelerating Azure AI services.

High CapEx and OpenAI-related risks are present, but strategic diversification and deep product integration support long-term growth.

MSFT targets $500B annual revenue by 2030, implying a feasible 12.16% CAGR and a potential $5.4T market cap.

Introduction

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has now completely expanded and transformed itself from a simple OS provider as it shifts towards Generative and Agentic AI, and has the benefits of its highly touted Azure infrastructure. With

As a detail-oriented investor with a strong foundation in finance and business writing, I focus on analyzing undervalued and disliked companies or industries that have strong fundamentals and good cash flows. I have a particular interest in sectors such as Oil&Gas and consumer goods. Basically, anything that has been unloved for unjustified reasons that could offer substantial returns. Energy Transfer is one of those companies that I came across when no one wanted to touch it and now I can't resolve myself to sell it. I will always focus more on long-term value investing but I can sometimes lose myself in possible deal arbitrage such as with Microsoft/ Activision Blizzard, Spirit Airlines/Jetblue (that one still hurts), and Nippon/U.S. Steel (perfect exit at $50.19). I tend to shun businesses that I can't understand either high-tech or certain consumer goods such as fashion (give me a Levi's jeans). I don't understand why anyone would invest in cryptocurrencies as well. Through Seeking Alpha, I aim to connect with like-minded investors, share insights, and build a collaborative community of individuals seeking superior returns and informed decision-making, currently on a quest to review every public company.

Quick Insights

MSFT’s CapEx, projected to exceed $80B annually by 2026, may compress gross margins short term but supports capacity expansion and long-term AI/cloud growth.

MSFT’s 27% OpenAI stake secures Azure revenue and IP access, but OpenAI’s diversification and competition with Copilot introduce both strategic hedging and margin risks.

Exceptional cloud and AI growth, integrated product suites, expanding margins, and credible 12%+ CAGR underpin the Buy rating and path to a $5.4T valuation by 2030.

The company's competitive moat is wide, but the price for that privilege is high.
The bottom line is that Lilly's competitive position is exceptionally strong, but it is being tested.
For a value investor, the question is whether the current price adequately discounts these risks while fully valuing the multi-decade growth potential of the new pillars.
Over the past 120 days, shares have rallied nearly 32%, a powerful move that underscores the market's belief in the company's growth trajectory.","Eli

has achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first healthcare company to reach a trillion-dollar market capitalization. The stock's ascent has been nothing short of vertiginous, with shares trading around $1,042 and a market cap of roughly $985 billion. This valuation places the company in an elite tier, worth more than twice the value of its closest pharmaceutical peer, Johnson & Johnson.

The growth story behind this price is undeniable. The company's blockbuster diabetes and obesity drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, have fueled a projected revenue jump from

. This explosive expansion is reflected in key valuation metrics. The stock's PEG ratio of 0.44 suggests the market is pricing in exceptionally high growth at a reasonable multiple, while the price-to-sales ratio of 16.6 underscores the premium placed on its future earnings power.

Yet, for a patient investor, the current price offers a narrow margin of safety. The average analyst price target sits at $1,096, implying only about 4.7% upside from recent levels. This minimal spread between the current price and the consensus target indicates that the market has already priced in a highly successful execution of the growth plan. The stock's recent underperformance, with shares down 3.5% today and 3.1% year-to-date, shows it is vulnerable to any stumble in the hyper-growth trajectory.

The bottom line is that Lilly's valuation is a bet on flawless, sustained execution. The company's competitive moat is wide, but the price for that privilege is high. For a disciplined investor, the prudent move is often to wait for a better entry point-a moment when the stock's price reflects the company's immense potential without demanding perfection in the near term.

The Width of the Competitive Moat: First-Mover Advantage and Clinical Superiority

Eli Lilly's ascent to a trillion-dollar valuation is built on a core growth engine of unprecedented scale and clinical perception. The combined sales of its two flagship GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, reached

. This staggering revenue has propelled the franchise to become the world's best-selling medicine, leapfrogging established giants like Merck's Keytruda. The durability of this engine hinges on two factors: a clear clinical edge and a strategic pipeline that aims to widen its lead.

Clinically, Lilly holds a distinct advantage. The company's drugs are viewed by physicians as more effective than Novo Nordisk's leading product, Wegovy. This perception is translating into market share, with

. This clinical superiority is not just a marketing point; it's a tangible moat that supports premium pricing and customer loyalty. The company is now preparing to extend this advantage into the oral market, where its drug orforglipron is . Analysts believe orforglipron, as a small molecule, will be easier to manufacture and distribute than Novo's peptide-based oral, potentially giving Lilly a supply and cost edge.

Yet, the path ahead is not without friction. The market's explosive demand has created severe supply constraints, a vulnerability that competitors have exploited. The rise of compound pharmacies filling the gap has hurt branded sales, with Novo executives pointing to this as a key drag. Furthermore, the competitive landscape is intensifying. Novo Nordisk launched its own oral Wegovy pill in early January, and the two companies are engaged in a fierce battle of clinical data, with a head-to-head study expected to read out soon. Lilly's moat is wide, but it is not impervious to pressure from a determined rival and the logistical challenges of meeting runaway demand.

The bottom line is that Lilly's competitive position is exceptionally strong, but it is being tested. The company's first-mover advantage in clinical perception and its pipeline depth provide a powerful foundation for compounding growth. However, the widening market also invites more competition and operational strain. For the stock to continue its ascent, Lilly must not only defend its current lead but also demonstrate that its clinical and manufacturing advantages are durable enough to withstand these mounting pressures.

Long-Term Compounding Potential vs. Near-Term Execution Risks

Eli Lilly's long-term compounding potential is now the central investment thesis. The company is aggressively building a multi-pillar franchise, moving far beyond its dominant incretin business. Over the past year, it has secured full FDA approval for its Alzheimer's drug Kisunla and completed major acquisitions to diversify its pipeline. The purchase of Morphic deepens its inflammatory bowel disease bet, while the deal for Scorpion Therapeutics adds precision oncology optionality. Its foray into radiopharmaceuticals, through the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and partnerships with Aktis and Radionetics, targets a high-growth field. Most ambitiously, the $1.3 billion acquisition of Verve Therapeutics for a ""one-and-done"" cardiovascular gene-editing therapy represents a long-horizon gamble on a transformative technology. This strategy is designed to create multiple, durable growth engines, ensuring the company's value can compound for decades.

The near-term execution risks, however, are substantial and multifaceted. The most immediate catalysts are clinical and competitive. This year will see Phase III results for the next-generation obesity drug retatrutide, which has already shown dramatic weight loss and pain reduction in early trials. More critically, the outcome of the head-to-head study between Novo Nordisk's CagriSema and Lilly's tirzepatide is expected in the first quarter. While Lilly has previously bested Novo's semaglutide in key metrics, a surprising win for the rival could pressure its market share and pricing power. The company's own oral obesity drug, orforglipron, is also poised for approval in the second quarter, adding another layer of competitive pressure and execution risk.

Regulatory and legal pressures form a persistent overhang. A new lawsuit filed by the Indiana Attorney General alleges Lilly participated in a scheme that inflated insulin prices by over 1,000% despite low manufacturing costs. This adds to the ongoing multistate litigation and regulatory scrutiny the company faces. More broadly, the potential for Medicare to expand coverage and negotiate prices for GLP-1 drugs is a major policy risk. A voluntary demonstration program is set to begin in July, with the possibility of mandatory coverage starting in January 2027. Such a move could compress margins and alter the entire reimbursement landscape for Lilly's blockbuster franchise.

The bottom line is a tension between a powerful long-term narrative and significant near-term hurdles. The pipeline diversification is a masterstroke for future value creation, but the stock's path will be dictated by the successful navigation of these clinical, competitive, and regulatory storms. For a value investor, the question is whether the current price adequately discounts these risks while fully valuing the multi-decade growth potential of the new pillars. The coming quarters will provide the answer.

Catalysts, Risks, and the Patient Investor's Watchlist

The stock's recent volatility is a direct reflection of its valuation. Over the past 120 days, shares have rallied nearly 32%, a powerful move that underscores the market's belief in the company's growth trajectory. Yet, in just the past five days, the stock has dropped about 3.5%. This choppiness is the hallmark of a stock priced for perfection, where every piece of news is scrutinized for signs of deviation from the high-growth script.

The forward view is dominated by two major catalysts that could reset the growth narrative. First is the launch of Lilly's oral obesity drug, orforglipron, which analysts expect to be approved in the

. This small-molecule pill is seen as a manufacturing advantage over competitors and could significantly expand the market. Second, the voluntary Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration begins in July, a policy trial that could pave the way for mandatory coverage by January 2027. Both events are critical for validating the path to the company's ambitious $94.3 billion in annual revenue by 2027 target.

The key risk is that the current price leaves no room for error. With a forward P/E of 58.5 and a PEG ratio of just 0.44, the market is paying a premium for growth that must be flawless. Any stumble in GLP-1 adoption, a delay in the oral drug launch, or a miss on pipeline milestones could trigger a significant correction. The fierce rivalry with Novo Nordisk adds another layer of pressure, as the upcoming head-to-head study readout in Q1 will be a key competitive signal.

For the patient investor, the watchlist is clear. Monitor the Q2 orforglipron approval and launch execution. Track the Medicare demonstration's rollout and its potential to expand the addressable market. And watch the company's own pipeline, particularly the Phase III results for retatrutide, to see if the growth engine can continue to accelerate. The stock's recent price action shows it is already in a state of high anticipation. The next move will depend entirely on whether Lilly can consistently deliver on the promise already priced in.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-qwen_generated_1767710520093.jpg.png,N,,2026-01-06 11:02:51.316294

Lilly and Nimbus started working together on a programme to develop small-molecule activators of AMPK, a regulator of cellular energy metabolism that is thought to switch the body from fat-storing to fat-burning mode. That deal included research, development, and commercial milestone payments up to $496 million.

Last year, the companies said they had achieved a significant preclinical milestone in the AMPK alliance, identifying a highly selective isoform-specific AMPK activator – something that Nimbus' R&D head Peter Tummino said had eluded drug developers for decades.

The new, multi-year research collaboration gives Lilly a worldwide license to the new candidate, identified using Nimbus' AI-enhanced computational drug discovery engine.

In a statement, Nimbus said it will now work with Lilly to ""apply [a] computational chemistry and structure-based drug design approach to an early-stage, small molecule discovery programme addressing a significant unmet need in obesity.""

Lilly has seen dramatic sales growth over the last couple of years from its injectable, dual GLP-1/GIP agonist obesity therapy Zepbound/Mounjaro (tirzepatide), and is hoping to add to its weight-loss stable with FDA approval for a new oral GLP-1 agonist, orforglipron, in the next few weeks.

With dozens of other candidates for obesity coming through the collective industry pipeline, directed at an expanding range of drug targets, the company has been actively building its pipeline with a series of licensing deals.

In 2025 alone, that included an $870 million collaboration with Camurus to apply its long-acting delivery technology to its injectable weight-loss candidates, which also include an experimental triple agonist – retatrutide – that achieved 29% weight loss in a phase 3 trial.

Last year also saw a $1.3 billion alliance with Superluminal to develop small molecule therapeutics targeting undisclosed GPCR targets involved in cardiometabolic diseases and obesity, and a $1.2 billion pact with SanegeneBio to seek out RNAi molecules against various metabolic targets.

Lilly's head of diabetes and metabolic R&D, Ruth Gimeno, said that Nimbus has ""demonstrated exceptional ability to tackle complex drug discovery challenges,"" and the potential new therapy ""represents an important addition to Lilly's efforts to advance innovative treatment options for patients.""",https://pharmaphorum.com/sites/default/files/2026-01/Lilly_Nimbus_logos_1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:01:35.658255

For context, TechCrunch, while citing The Information, reported that OpenAI has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to improve audio AI for an upcoming device and is developing a new audio model architecture focused on more natural and accurate responses.

Notably, the new audio model is expected to handle interruptions and speak while the user is talking, with a rollout timeframe around early 2026.

Pertinently, all these developments at OpenAI point to a larger question: what changes when AI becomes voice-first?

The significance here is not that OpenAI may ship new hardware, but in how companies now treat audio as a primary interface for AI: a change that reshapes how users experience accuracy, trust, privacy, and security.

What OpenAI is reportedly changing

OpenAI’s internal assessment, as reported by The Information, points to a clear problem. Its audio models lag behind its text models in both accuracy and response speed, a gap that becomes harder to ignore as more products move toward voice-led interaction.

That assessment reflects a broader shift already visible across major tech platforms. Voice assistants have become a default feature in homes through smart speakers. Meta has begun using multi-microphone arrays in its Ray-Ban smart glasses to actively process and enhance real-world conversations.

Meanwhile, Google has started experimenting with “Audio Overviews” that convert search results into spoken summaries rather than lists of links. And Tesla is integrating xAI’s chatbot Grok into its vehicles to allow drivers to control navigation-related commands.

Against this backdrop, OpenAI is not pursuing incremental improvements in text-to-speech. Instead, it is trying to unify its text and audio stack so the system can listen, reason, and respond in real time, including during overlapping conversational dynamics. As mentioned earlier, OpenAI’s next audio model will support more natural interaction, handle interruptions, and speak while the user is still talking.

If OpenAI succeeds, it moves AI away from turn-based chat and closer to ambient, continuous conversation, where voice becomes the primary interface.

What audio-first AI means in practice

Audio-first AI does not simply add voice input to an existing chatbot. It redesigns the interaction model so speech becomes the default channel in both directions.

That produces three practical shifts.

First, conversations rely less on turn-taking and more on overlap. If the system can respond while the user is speaking, interactions begin to resemble live conversation rather than typed Q&A.

Secondly, audio lowers friction. Users no longer open an app, type a query, and read a response. They speak, and the system speaks back.

And thirdly, the interaction becomes invisible. The interface no longer sits on a screen that users can pause, scroll, or inspect. It fades into the room, the car, or the wearable device.

Why voice changes how people trust AI

Voice reduces friction and reshapes credibility

Text interfaces introduce friction that can help users stay sceptical. Users can re-read responses, scroll back, or copy claims to verify them elsewhere. Voice-based interaction may reduce some of that friction because responses unfold in real-time and disappear once spoken.

Furthermore, a particular user’s experience in voice-led interactions can influence perceptions of credibility. To explain, a 2022 systematic review of voice assistant usability found that user acceptance is closely tied to overall usability and interaction experience, particularly in systems where voice is the primary mode of interaction.

Moreover, conversational systems can make uncertainty harder to notice. To explain, most audio systems tend to deliver a single response rather than signalling hesitation or asking for clarification, even when speech input contains ambiguity due to accents, background noise, overlapping speakers, or imperfect microphone capture. In such cases, users may have limited visibility into what the system actually heard or how confident it was in its interpretation.

As a result, trust dynamics may begin to shift before questions of privacy, regulation, or liability come into focus.

Trust shifts also complicate consent

The shift in trust dynamics has implications beyond perception. Audio-first systems rely on microphones that remain always on or close to it, increasing the likelihood of passive data capture and recording of bystanders.

Notably, European data protection regulators have cautioned that voice assistants raise specific data protection risks, particularly where audio is retained by default or speech is captured in shared environments, potentially conflicting with principles such as storage limitation and informed consent.

In the Indian context specifically, the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act requires that consent be “free, specific, informed, unconditional and unambiguous”, and that it be demonstrated through a clear affirmative action by the individual providing it, as set out in Section 6(1) of the Act.

However in practice, ambient audio makes that standard difficult to meet, as many affected individuals may never receive notice, let alone an opportunity to consent.

Who is responsible when voice assistants goes wrong

Voice-first AI does not merely change how users interact with systems. It also complicates questions of responsibility when those systems act in ways users did not intend.

A well-known example surfaced in earlier generations of voice assistants. In 2017, an Amazon Alexa device reportedly picked up a phrase during a television broadcast and placed an unintended order: a case that MediaNama later examined during its Governing the AI Ecosystem roundtable on agentic systems. Participants at the discussion argued that while the outcome was reversible, the incident highlighted how ambient, voice-triggered systems can act without a clear or deliberate user instruction.

Legal and policy experts at the roundtable differed on where liability should sit in such cases. Some argued that developers and manufacturers bear responsibility when foreseeable safeguards are missing, treating such failures as closer to product defects.

Others pointed to user-configurable settings, such as voice recognition controls or payment authorisations, as factors that could shift responsibility back to users. Several participants also cautioned that consent and choice can become illusory when systems rely on long, complex terms or default configurations that users rarely understand.

Overall, these views highlight how voice-first interaction blurs traditional boundaries between user action and system behaviour, complicating how responsibility is assigned when things go wrong.

Security risks specific to voice interfaces

Audio-first AI also expands the attack surface, as security research has shown. Unlike text-based systems, voice interfaces must continuously process ambient sound from their surroundings, increasing exposure to unintended inputs and malicious triggers.

As users often cannot see or review what the system has “heard”, errors or abuse can occur without immediate detection, making security failures harder to spot and contest.

Command injection can bypass human perception

Researchers behind the DolphinAttack paper demonstrated that attackers can embed voice commands into ultrasonic frequencies that humans cannot hear but microphones and speech recognition systems can still pick up.

In simple terms, a device can be made to “hear” a command even though the user hears nothing at all. For audio-first systems designed to listen continuously, this means actions could be triggered without the user ever realising a command was issued.

Spoofing no longer requires physical access

Advances in synthetic voice generation have also increased spoofing risks. In a widely cited case reported by Forbes, a fraudster used an AI-generated voice to impersonate a company executive and persuade an employee to transfer $243,000 (more than Rs 2.19 crore).

For consumer-facing devices the context differs, however the underlying lesson remains. If a system treats voice as proof of identity, it may be vulnerable to replayed recordings, synthetic voices, or other forms of impersonation. Speaker recognition, which attempts to verify a user based on vocal characteristics, can reduce some risk. But it cannot reliably distinguish between a real person and a high-quality imitation.

Consequently, as audio-first systems become more widespread, these vulnerabilities turn voice-driven technology from a convenience into a potential point of failure.

Piggly Wiggly's list totaled $82.18 for name brand items and $71.18 for the store brand items.","The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tracked the prices of 18 grocery items at 13 area stores in late December.

Aldi was the least expensive store for the list of items, totaling $48.32.

Prices for a list of name-brand items at Walmart, Woodman's, Meijer, and Target all saw slight decreases from November.

Local stores like Sendik's, El Rey, Metcalfe's, and Outpost Co-op were among the most expensive options.

Every month, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel tracks the prices of groceries at major Milwaukee-area grocery stores.

On Dec. 29 and Dec. 30, the Journal Sentinel collected the price of a list of groceries at 13 stores, from national retail chains to local cooperatives. When applicable, we also compared the cost of name brand items with their store brand alternatives.

Prices do not include limited-time deals or discounts.

The grocery list is as follows:

A half-gallon of almond milk

A loaf of whole wheat bread

One pound of bacon

One pound of bananas

One pound of 80/20 ground beef, not Angus certified

One pound of butter in a four-pack

A box of Cheerios

A box of Cheez-Its

A dozen eggs

A five-pound bag of flour

Canned green beans

An 18-ounce jar of strawberry jam

A head of iceberg lettuce

A gallon of whole milk

One navel orange

A two-roll pack of paper towels

A 16-ounce jar of peanut butter

A six-pack of toilet paper

How prices at Walmart, Target, Meijer and Woodman's compare to last month

On Nov. 19, the list of name brand items at Walmart, 4140 W. Greenfield Ave. in West Milwaukee, cost just over $70. The price has since dropped to $68.76.

Groceries at Woodman's at 8131 S. Howell Ave. in Oak Creek dropped from $69.80 on Nov. 21 to $67.22 on Dec. 29.

Other stores saw smaller price drops. Groceries at Meijer, 11111 W. Burleigh St. in Wauwatosa, totaled $74.02, 14 cents cheaper than in November.

At Target, 2950 S. Chase Ave., prices decreased from $70.21 to $69.81.

The overall price drops at these stores can largely be attributed to the falling price of bacon, usually one of the most expensive items on the list. The cost of a pound of Oscar Mayer bacon at Walmart dropped from $8.48 in November to $7.48 on Dec. 29.

Aldi brands are cheapest for the list of items we bought

Aldi does not offer the same name brands that other large retailers do, so we tracked the prices of equivalent items at the store located at 225 E. Capitol Drive.

Aldi's list totaled $48.32, the least expensive of all stores tracked.

After Aldi, the cheapest lists were those that used store brand alternatives to name brand items. Walmart's store brand list totaled $53.95, followed by Meijer at $56.52.

Groceries more expensive at Pick 'n Save, Festival Foods, Whole Foods

Pricier options include Pick 'n Save at 1100 E. Garfield Ave., Piggly Wiggly at 123 W. Oklahoma Ave., Whole Foods at 2305 N. Prospect Ave. and Festival Foods at 11111 W. Greenfield Ave. in West Allis.

Pick 'n Save's name brand list cost $81.23, down slightly from $81.53 on Nov. 19. Substituting for store brand items brought the price down to $59.13.

Piggly Wiggly's list totaled $82.18 for name brand items and $71.18 for the store brand items.

Groceries at Whole Foods, which carries its own brand in place of many name brand items, cost $81.62 on Dec. 30. West Allis' Festival Foods was even pricier, totaling $93.78.

How did prices compare at Sendik's, Outpost and El Rey?

The Journal Sentinel also tracked prices at notable local grocery stores, including Outpost Co-op at 100 E. Capitol Drive; Sendik's Food Market, 8616 W. North Ave. in Wauwatosa; Metcalfe's Market, 6700 W. State St. in Wauwatosa; and El Rey Family Market, 5200 W. Oklahoma Ave.

Like Aldi, these stores do not carry many of the name brand items we track on this list, so they've been substituted for equivalent store or name brands.

Sendik's Food Market was the cheapest of the four local stores at $84.74. It was followed by El Rey Family Market, a family-owned Hispanic grocery store, at $88.49.

Metcalfe's Market, which has two locations in Madison and one in Wauwatosa, totaled $91.82 in December.

Outpost Co-op's list was the most expensive of all stores tracked, totaling $102.12. That's more than double the cost of the cheapest list, Aldi, located just a block east of Outpost on Capitol Drive.

Outpost carries many organic produce and dairy items, which are generally more expensive than conventionally farmed foods. The cooperative also offers deals and savings exclusive to owners, who pay $200 for a share in the store.

The Coca-Cola Company’s new CEO Henrique Braun will step into his role on March 31, as nine-year CEO James Quincey moves to become executive chair.
Smith told CNBC in November L.L.","Last year’s slew of CEO changes means many retailers and CPGs are starting off the year preparing for major leadership transitions...or hoping to finally end their ongoing executive searches. Here are the chief exec changes we’re keeping an eye on this year:

CEOs we already know

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is retiring after 12 years leading the big box retailer, with Walmart US CEO John Furner taking over as chief exec on February 1. Furner will look to continue Walmart’s current momentum: The retailer’s latest quarterly earnings exceeded analyst expectations, highlighted by strong grocery and health and wellness sales and a booming ecommerce presence. One of Furner’s biggest tasks ahead will be leading Walmart further into its AI era.

Target’s new COO Michael Fiddelke will also assume his new role as CEO in February as Brian Cornell shifts to executive chair. Fiddelke faces an uphill battle after a decidedly off-target (pun intended) year for the retailer that saw continuing foot traffic declines and falling comp sales as consumers pull back spend on discretionary goods.

The Coca-Cola Company’s new CEO Henrique Braun will step into his role on March 31, as nine-year CEO James Quincey moves to become executive chair. Braun, who joined Coca-Cola in 1996 and has served as COO for the last year, will take the helm as the beverage giant continues to outperform its rival, PepsiCo, in a tricky CPG environment, thanks in part to popularity of its zero-sugar drinks.

CEOs that are TBD

Coty faced a management shake-up in late December when controlling shareholder JAB Holdings reportedly pushed for the exits of chair Peter Harf and five-year CEO Sue Nabi. The company had an underwhelming 2025, launching a review of its mass beauty business in September that could mean the sale of CoverGirl and Rimmel, and losing its license to make Gucci fragrances to L’Oréal in 2028.

On December 22, Coty announced Procter & Gamble vet Markus Strobel, who was most recently head of P&G’s global skin and personal care business, will become its executive chair and interim CEO starting January 1. The company didn’t share its plans for naming a permanent chief exec.

Kroger is still looking for its next leader after 11-year CEO Rodney McMullen suddenly resigned in March. Interim CEO Ronald Sargent said in December the new chief exec, whom it aims to announce in Q1, will be an external hire, the first in the grocer’s 143-year history. Sargent said Kroger is looking for a candidate with “a deep understanding of retail transformation” who is “very close to the customer.”

Lululemon is still on the hunt for a replacement for CEO Calvin McDonald, who will exit his role on January 31 after leading the activewear brand since 2018. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which now has a $1 billion stake in Lululemon, has its sights on former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as his successor.

7-Eleven’s CEO Joseph DePinto retired at the end of 2025 after 20+ years leading the convenience chain. President Stan Reynolds and COO Douglas Rosencrans filled the role as co-CEOs on an interim basis while its board of directors searches for DePinto’s successor.

L.L. Bean’s President and CEO Stephen Smith will depart his role in the spring after a decade leading the outerwear and apparel maker. Smith told CNBC in November L.L. Bean was “cautiously optimistic” about its holiday performance after a “volatile year” in consumer goods.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/706a7d4f65bafc712cb9c83ef64ed4612752770a-6960x4640.jpg?rect=0,493,6960,3654&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-06 11:03:03.261783

SAN FRANCISCO and LAS VEGAS, Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- At CES 2026, Instacart (Nasdaq: CART) unveiled Data Hub, its new clean room solution that gives consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands and their agency partners secure, privacy-safe access to Instacart's rich first-party grocery data. Data Hub lets marketers join their own data with Instacart's purchase signals to gain insights that can be used to inform strategy, plan off-platform audiences, and measure omnichannel performance.

""Brands and agencies are eager for easier access to trusted, scaled sources of purchase data. We've designed the Instacart Data Hub to provide partners with a deeper understanding of shopping behavior and a practical way to apply those insights to their marketing strategies.""

Turning Grocery Insights Into Action

Data Hub gives marketers deeper visibility into key customer behaviors - including lifetime value, new to brand, and repurchase frequency - while providing access to Instacart's first-party grocery shopping data. Powered by real consumer behavior across the Instacart Marketplace, Data Hub enables advertisers to reach incremental, high-value consumers and uncover insights that inform smarter media strategies.

The retailer announced that it is running ads within Sparky, its AI shopping agent, after testing the first ads within the tool last fall.

Sparky is an AI shopping assistant within Walmart’s mobile app. Shoppers can ask Sparky questions and prompts to find products, and Sparky analyzes products and reviews to recommend products available at Walmart.

Ads within Sparky appear as a sponsored prompt when shoppers ask the tool questions for product recommendations. In a survey of Walmart customers, Walmart reports that 81% of shoppers have used Sparky to look up product availability and details about a product before purchasing. Search is the most popular use case for Sparky, according to Walmart.

“We know it’s an interesting new surface, and we want to be there and experiment in that new surface—even though it’s early days,” Khurrum Malik, VP of business and product marketing for Walmart Connect, told ADWEEK. Walmart Connect is Walmart’s advertising arm.

Walmart’s Sparky directly competes with Amazon’s gen AI agent Rufus, which began running ads in 2024.

In addition to Sparky, Walmart inked a deal with OpenAI last year that allows people to shop from ChatGPT.

Malik said one way Walmart is hoping to differentiate itself from competitors is with its scale. Walmart has 150 million weekly shoppers across 4,600 stores and online.

“If you think about our advertisers, they want simplicity, they want automation, so agentic experiences help there,” Malik said.

Gen AI-driven ads

In July, Walmart announced an AI assistant called Marty, which helps Walmart’s suppliers and advertisers manage retail operations as well as advertising.

Now, Walmart is rolling out a beta program within Marty that manages sponsored search campaigns. Marty analyzes sponsored search campaigns to offer advertisers campaign recommendations on things such as bidding and keywords. Marty also spits out reports about the performance of campaigns, including share of voice, a metric that tracks an advertisers’ market share relative to competitors.

According to Walmart, 97% of queries for Marty are unique, indicating that advertisers are using the tool for custom use cases. Marty’s recommendations are particularly helpful for emerging advertisers, including small businesses and midsize brands that want tailored suggestions for their campaigns, Malik said.

Marty will be available to all of Walmart’s advertisers that buy search ads in Walmart Connect Ad Center in the first half of this year. Malik said that Marty will also expand to Walmart’s other ad formats this year.

“Over time, you can imagine Marty playing a role as a cross-surface tool where you can go and help an advertiser invest in any of the surfaces where we can help them drive sales,” Malik said.

Walmart is also betting on creative applications of gen AI for advertisers this year. A tool called Automated Creative Generator helps advertisers spin up creative like background for product photos. Walmart claims that the tool reduces production time by 80%.

More broadly, Malik said that advertisers are increasingly investing brand-oriented budgets as well as performance budgets with Walmart. In one example, Walmart began pitching advertisers on connected TV campaigns last year after acquiring smart TV manufacturer Vizio.

“Advertisers are increasingly asking us, ’Hey, you’ve been helping us with performance solutions—help us with upper funnel as well,’” Malik said.",https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Walmart-Sparky.png?w=600&h=315&crop=1,N,,2026-01-06 10:02:26.763476

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.

Illustrations

You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.

You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).

Illustrations

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

HP Inc. announced Monday it’s looking to blaze new trails by moving all of the compute from an all-in-one PC into the keyboard form factor.

The result is the HP EliteBoard G1a, announced Monday as the latest addition to the HP AI PC portfolio.

[Related: HP Debuts EliteBook X G2 Series At CES 2026: 10 Big Things To Know]

The PC giant also disclosed Monday it is making big strides to advance GenAI performance on its premium EliteBook X commercial notebooks with the launch of second-generation AI PC devices in the series.

The announcements come in connection with the massive CES 2026 conference, taking place this week in Las Vegas.

What follows are five key details to know about HP’s EliteBoard G1a.

New Design Approach

The HP EliteBoard G1a represents a major reversal from past desktop PC design, according to HP.

The new design moves the compute power that once had to be located within the all-in-one or tower form factor, and embeds it directly into the keyboard.

By contrast, the traditional all-in-one PC design approach locks users into a single display (and working location, to some degree) for the life of the PC.

With the EliteBoard, instead, the entire PC is housed within the keyboard chassis, HP said.

Display Flexibility

For users that might wish to change displays over time, this allows those users to choose any display configuration without replacing the device itself, according to HP.

Notably, the approach also gives organizations and users more control over upgrade cycles and workspace customization, the company said.

In addition to stationary workers seeking more flexibility, HP also built the EliteBoard G1a around users that might share a display, such as in the health care space, HP said.

Device Options

Two versions of the HP EliteBoard G1a will be available to accommodate the two types of use cases, according to HP.

For users that need to share a display, one version of the device will offer a detachable cable and integrated battery, the company said.

Meanwhile, the stationary configuration features a lockable cable designed for environments where devices must remain physically secured, HP said.

Performance, Portability And Productivity

On performance, HP also classifies the EliteBoard G1a as an AI PC, with an AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series chip powering the device.

The device offers more than 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of neural processing unit (NPU) performance for highly responsive workloads, according to HP.

On portability, meanwhile, the EliteBoard G1a measures 12mm (0.47 of an inch) in terms of thickness and weighs about 1.65 pounds, HP said.

For productivity and collaboration, the keyboard-PC also includes dual mics and speakers, according to the company.

Pricing And Availability

The EliteBoard G1a Next Gen AI PC is expected to be available starting in March, HP announced

Pricing was not immediately disclosed and will be provided “closer to availability,” the company said in its news release.",https://www.crn.com/news/computing/2026/media_1aacfb8a0474a292fa9587518e7ad2e6412572a01.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-06 11:03:00.169981

The update was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026, where the partners outlined progress on a global robotaxi programme.

According to the companies, autonomous testing began in December 2025 and is intended to support a commercial launch expected later this year in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Testing activities are being led by Nuro, using robotaxi engineering prototypes overseen by autonomous vehicle operators.

Lucid Autonomous & ADAS vice president Kay Stepper said: “Our robotaxi programme with Uber and Nuro is a key part of how Lucid is leveraging its technology to create a more sustainable future of mobility that is widely accessible.”

The vehicle platform is based on the all-electric Lucid Gravity and incorporates a “next-gen” sensor suite that combines cameras, solid-state lidar and radar systems to deliver 360-degree perception.

These components are integrated into the vehicle body as well as a purpose-built, “low-profile” roof-mounted halo.

The halo features integrated LEDs designed to help passengers identify the correct vehicle, display rider initials and indicate ride status from pick-up to drop-off, the press statement read.

Inside the cabin, passengers can manage settings such as seating, climate and music, access support functions, or request the vehicle to pull over, the press statement further added.

Visualisation screens display what the robotaxi is detecting and its intended route in real time, including interactions with traffic lights, pedestrians and surrounding vehicles.

The robotaxi is configured to accommodate up to six passengers and includes luggage capacity aimed at group travel.

Computing capability is delivered through NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Thor, part of the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform, supporting AI processing for autonomous driving.

Lucid said the on-road trials form part of Nuro’s safety and validation framework, which evaluates multiple functions across the full autonomy stack, including Nuro’s end-to-end AI foundation model.

Nuro co-founder and co-CEO Dave Ferguson added: “The debut of our production-intent robotaxi with Lucid and Uber is a significant milestone on our path to delivering autonomy at scale.”

The programme also incorporates closed-course testing and simulation to assess performance across a wide range of driving scenarios.

Subject to final validation, the companies expect the production-intent robotaxi to enter production later this year at Lucid’s manufacturing facility in Arizona.

Uber Autonomous Mobility & Delivery global head Sarfraz Maredia added: “Uber is proud to partner with Lucid and Nuro to bring a state-of-the-art robotaxi to market later this year.”

It was exposed alongside a similar ""Cum-ex"" dividend tax fraud published by the media consortium in 2018.
The aim is ""to avoid paying the tax applicable to the payment of this dividend,"" the consortium said.
source: AFP Copyright 2026 Alliance News Ltd. All Rights Reserved.","(Alliance News) - British-based bank HSBC will appear in a Paris court this week to finalise a multimillion-euro fine over alleged dividend tax fraud, a judicial source told AFP on Tuesday.

The case is part of investigations sparked by a massive fraud carried out for years in several European countries, revealed by a consortium of European news outlets in 2018.

Several banks were raided after the allegations emerged, and some have already agreed to fines to avoid further prosecution.

""A hearing to validate the deal concerning HSBC in the fiscal domain will take place Thursday at 10:00 am,"" the legal source said, without further details.

In December, Bloomberg News reported the fine would be EUR300 million (USD350 million) to close the investigation, which the Paris financial prosecutor's office has not confirmed.

Contacted by AFP, HSBC declined to comment but referred to a note from its third-quarter earnings statement in October, which cited an EUR300 million provision for an inquiry ""relating to dividend withholdings of certain legacy trading activities"".

The financial prosecutor's office launched in December 2021 inquiries into six large banks, which a source close to the case confirmed as HSBC, Credit Agricole unit Cacib, BNP Paribas and its Exane unit, Societe Generale and Natixis.

In September, Credit Agricole's Cacib was the first to accept a deal with French prosecutors, agreeing to pay EUR88 million .

The fraud is known as ""CumCum"" and involves an investor selling shares to another party just before dividend payment day, to avoid paying taxes, and then immediately repurchasing the shares, with both parties sharing the illicit proceeds.

It was exposed alongside a similar ""Cum-ex"" dividend tax fraud published by the media consortium in 2018.

The amounts involved in the ""Cum-ex"" frauds alone are suspected to have reached 140 billion euros (USD151 billion) over a period of 20 years, the media group said in 2021.

The aim is ""to avoid paying the tax applicable to the payment of this dividend,"" the consortium said.

Banks are suspected of acting as intermediaries in the practice and even charging a commission to the investors taking part.

In December 2022, a German court sentenced lawyer Hanno Berger, believed to be the original mastermind of the scheme, to eight years in prison.

HSBC shares were up 1.1% at 1,220.20 pence in London on Tuesday afternoon.

Click to get this free report HP Inc. (HPQ) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","HP Inc. provides personal computing, printing, and other related technologies in the United States and internationally. Formerly known as Hewlett-Packard, the company changed its name in October 2015. It serves small- and medium-sized businesses, the public sector, and large enterprises.

Key challenges remain for HP in 2026 including changes in customer purchasing behavior and industry component availability. A difficult macroeconomic environment and lingering inflationary conditions do not bode well for the company’s outlook.

HP’s forecast for fiscal 2026 PC demand raises concerns regarding its growth prospects in the short-term. Management expects PC unit volumes to fall in the current year. Lower volumes and price pressures would make it harder to protect margins and meet earnings targets.

The computing giant faces stiff competition for its PC and printer businesses. The PC segment competes with the likes of Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. In the latest quarter, print revenues fell 4% year-over-year as office demand in North America and Europe remained soft. The print segment will likely continue to face structural challenges as customers reduce printing volumes and shift to digital workflows.

The Zacks Rundown

A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock, HP HPQ is a component of the Zacks Computer – Micro Computers industry group, which currently ranks in the bottom 14% out of approximately 250 Zacks Ranked Industries. As such, we expect this industry group as a whole to underperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months.

Stocks in the bottom tiers of industries can often be intriguing short candidates. While individual stocks have the ability to outperform even when they’re part of a lagging industry, the inclusion in a weaker group serves as a headwind for any potential rallies and the journey forward is that much more difficult.

HPQ shares have been underperforming the market over the past year. The stock is trading near a 52-week low even as the major U.S. indexes hover near all-time highs.

Recent Earnings Misses & Deteriorating Outlook

HP has fallen short of earnings estimates in four of the past six quarters. The technology company posted a trailing four-quarter average earnings miss of -2.6%. Consistently falling short of earnings estimates is a recipe for underperformance, and HP is no exception.

The company has been on the receiving end of negative earnings estimate revisions as of late. Looking at the current fiscal year, analysts have slashed estimates by -9.64% in the past 60 days. The FY2026 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate is now $3.00 per share, reflecting negative growth of -3.9% relative to the prior year.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Falling earnings estimates are a huge red flag and need to be respected. Negative growth year-over-year is the type of trend that bears like to see.

Technical Outlook

As illustrated below, HPQ stock is in a sustained downtrend. Notice how the stock has shown little in the way of a trend, widely underperforming the major indices. Also note that shares are trading below downward-sloping 50-day (blue line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages – another good sign for the bears.

Image Source: StockCharts

HPQ stock has experienced what is known as a “death cross,” whereby the stock’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. Shares would have to make an outsized move to the upside and show increasing earnings estimate revisions to warrant taking any long positions. The stock has fallen more than 30% in the past year alone.

Final Thoughts

A deteriorating fundamental and technical backdrop show that this stock is not set to make its way to new highs anytime soon. The fact that HPQ stock is included in one of the worst-performing industry groups adds yet another headwind to a long list of concerns.

A history of earnings misses and falling future earnings estimates will likely serve as a ceiling to any potential rallies, nurturing the stock’s downtrend.

Potential investors may want to give this stock the cold shoulder, or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy. Bulls will want to steer clear of HP until the situation shows major signs of improvement.

Mobile app use up 19% during 2025 Championships

Wimbledon has extended its official artificial intelligence (AI), cloud and digital transformation partnership with IBM, prolonging one of the most successful technology partnerships in sport.

The tech giant first teamed up with the All England Club (AELTC) in 1990. In 1995 they launched an official website and the arrangement now encompasses a wide a range of tools and infrastructure designed to support the tennis Grand Slam’s operations, data gathering and fan engagement activities.

This latest ‘multi-year’ renewal will amplify these efforts and extend the relationship well into a fourth decade.

AI has been a particular focus of the two’s efforts in recent years, with intelligent technologies used to automatically clip and package highlights packages for multiple digital platforms, create data-driven insights for fans, and personalise content.

Usama Al-Qassab, marketing and commercial director at the AELTC, told SportsPro AI last year that Wimbledon’s expanded use of AI helped drive mobile app usage by 19 per cent during the 2025 Championships, with the tournament recording a total 19.1 billion engagements across its digital, social and broadcast channels.

“We are delighted to have agreed a multi-year extension to our long-standing partnership with IBM,” said Al-Qassab. “For 35 years, IBM and the All England Club have embraced innovation and created world-leading digital experiences to bring our fans closer to The Championships. As we look to attract the next generation of Wimbledon fans from around the world, the AI-powered capabilities of IBM will be key to ensuring our future digital experiences are relevant, personalised and engaging.”

For IBM, the partnership has provided a high-profile use case and proving ground for its infrastructure, software and intelligent capabilities which are used across multiple industries. Other partners in the sports industry include the US Open and the Masters golf major.

“Our partnership with Wimbledon represents the very best of what a long-term, strategic collaboration can be. It’s rooted in shared values, trust built over time, and a joint commitment to constant innovation,” Jonathan Adashek, SVP, marketing and communications, IBM told SportsPro.

“We’ve set the bar for how sports properties can harness technology to modernise their operations, become more productive and create new loyalties that span generations of fans – all while staying true to their brand heritage.

“The same AI and data platforms we use to enhance the fan experience at Wimbledon are the ones we put into the hands of our clients in industries all across the globe. The partnership becomes a live showcase of how we are applying AI where it meaningfully improves how people experience the event.”

SportsPro says…

Wimbledon’s digital strategy has two clear goals. The first is to use technology to ensure the tournament runs as smoothly as possible, and the second is to engage fans in attendance in SW19 and those watching around the world.

Not everything has gone to plan, as demonstrated by the human error-related mishaps with electronic line calling (ELC) this summer, being evidence of that. But in general, most of its innovation has been successful.

For the past three decades, its partnership with IBM has been crucial to this mission – introducing many cutting-edge technologies and establishing best practices for the industry in the process.

Indeed, the Grand Slam claims its smartphone app was the first to include such detailed live sports data when it launched in 2009 and it was using ‘cognitive computing’ long before AI became the sports technology term de jour.

In many ways, it has been the prototype for the modern sports technology partnership, prioritising genuine technical need over gimmickry and marketing considerations – even if the commercial value of this deal is significant to IBM given the popularity of Wimbledon.

This extension continues one of the most celebrated partnerships in the industry, providing prestige to both parties, and providing plenty of reference cases for the industry to benefit from.

Data transparency remains a major concern, with 71 per cent of consumers worried about how generative AI uses personal information.
According to the report, brands that combine speed and personalisation with timely human support are more likely to earn long-term consumer loyalty.","Consumer priorities are shifting in 2026, with fairness emerging as a central element of perceived value, according to a new global consumer trends report from the Capgemini Research Institute. The report, titled What matters to today’s consumer 2026: How AI is transforming value perception, finds that concerns over declining purchasing power and financial uncertainty are prompting consumers to be more deliberate about how they save money and where they choose to spend.

The fifth edition of the annual report shows that consumers are balancing essential spending with intentional indulgences that provide emotional uplift. While many are embracing artificial intelligence to help navigate the marketplace, issues around data control and transparency remain significant, with consumers favouring brands that combine digital convenience with in-person support.

Price transparency and honest communication are now seen as key markers of brand credibility. Nearly three in four consumers (74 per cent) say they would switch brands for a lower regular price, while 71 per cent would do so if pack sizes or quality were reduced without clear notice. A majority of respondents consider shrinkflation to be unfair, with most indicating a preference for a small, clearly communicated price increase rather than discreet downsizing.

The research also finds that around half of consumers are buying smaller quantities and opting for cheaper alternatives to manage their budgets. However, brand trust remains strong in categories where quality and performance are critical. According to the report, 77 per cent of consumers across income groups avoid private labels for products such as electronics and baby care. At the same time, emotional factors continue to influence purchasing decisions, with seven in ten consumers seeking small indulgences to ease financial stress, highlighting that value is both practical and emotional.

“Value today goes beyond price and quality; it’s built on fairness, transparency, and emotional connection. Consumers want invisible AI that both empowers informed decisions and seamlessly blends convenience and emotional connection,” said Dreen Yang, Global Consumer Products & Retail Leader at Capgemini. “AI is increasingly reshaping the shopping experience, but success depends on clarity, responsible use, and safeguards that protect consumers. Brands that blend technology with trust and purpose will enjoy lasting loyalty.”

The report notes that AI is evolving from a functional tool into a trusted shopping advisor. AI now supports consumers by interpreting preferences and behaviours and by offering real-time assistance through chatbots and virtual assistants. One in four consumers used generative AI shopping tools in 2025, and a further 31 per cent plan to adopt them in the future. Despite this growth, only 19 per cent of consumers say they are willing to pay a monthly subscription or one-time fee for chatbots or virtual shopping assistants.

While adoption is increasing, consumers continue to express caution. The majority of shoppers (76 per cent) want the ability to set boundaries for AI assistants, and two-thirds say they trust AI more when it explains the reasoning behind its recommendations and actions. Data transparency remains a major concern, with 71 per cent of consumers worried about how generative AI uses personal information. Two-thirds of consumers also expect brands to disclose when advertising content is AI-generated.

The findings further show that technology alone is not enough to secure loyalty. Consumers want efficiency, relevance, and human connection to coexist. Nearly two-thirds of respondents want generative AI to deliver hyper-personalised content, and 65 per cent say technology has made shopping less stressful. However, more than seven in ten consumers still value human assistance for complex purchases, such as meal planning or resolving service issues. According to the report, brands that combine speed and personalisation with timely human support are more likely to earn long-term consumer loyalty.",https://static.businessworld.in/BW Style Pic (36)_20260106171724_ogImage_48.png,N,,2026-01-06 10:01:31.057267
ID27,L’Oréal,2026-01-06 12:22:14+00:00,Tech Edition,L'Oréal brings infrared light technology to hair and skincare with two new beauty tech ...,Nurin Sofia,,,,,https://www.techedt.com/loreal-brings-infrared-light-technology-to-hair-and-skincare-with-two-new-beauty-tech-innovations-at-ces-2026,"L’Oréal Groupe has unveiled two new beauty technology innovations that apply infrared light to hair and skin, reinforcing its long-term focus on science-led product development.
Infrared light redefines heat styling with Light Straight + Multi-styler The Light Straight + Multi-styler addresses one of the most persistent challenges in hair styling: heat damage.
Developed by L’Oréal Research and Innovation, the Light Straight + Multi-styler uses patented infrared light technology to deliver styling results at lower temperatures.
The Light Straight + Multi-styler is scheduled for global release in 2027, with pricing details to be announced closer to launch.
As with the Light Straight + Multi-styler, pricing and additional specifications will be shared closer to commercial availability.","L’Oréal Groupe has unveiled two new beauty technology innovations that apply infrared light to hair and skin, reinforcing its long-term focus on science-led product development. Introduced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas, the Light Straight + Multi-styler and the LED Face Mask both received CES 2026 Innovation Award Honoree recognition, highlighting their use of advanced light-based technologies to enhance performance while addressing common concerns around hair damage and skin ageing.

The announcement continues L’Oréal’s multi-year push to integrate scientific research, digital capabilities and hardware innovation into consumer beauty products. The company positions these developments as part of its broader ambition to evolve from a traditional beauty brand into a beauty technology leader, using scientific discovery to create more personalised, effective and preventative beauty solutions.

Barbara Lavernos, Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology at L’Oréal Groupe, said the company’s latest showcase at CES reflects a long-standing belief that beauty and science are closely linked. She noted that L’Oréal continues to combine scientific advances with creativity to design beauty experiences that are both more effective and better adapted to individual needs, building on more than a century of research heritage.

Infrared light redefines heat styling with Light Straight + Multi-styler

The Light Straight + Multi-styler addresses one of the most persistent challenges in hair styling: heat damage. Traditional hair straighteners often reach temperatures of 400°F or higher, exceeding the threshold at which keratin begins to denature. Over time, this can weaken the hair cuticle, lead to breakage and reduce shine. According to a 2024 US consumer study conducted by L’Oréal, 58 percent of women surveyed said their hair damage was caused by heat styling.

Developed by L’Oréal Research and Innovation, the Light Straight + Multi-styler uses patented infrared light technology to deliver styling results at lower temperatures. The device’s glass plates never exceed 320°F, a significant reduction compared to conventional straighteners. Instrumental tests carried out by L’Oréal indicate that the device works three times faster than leading premium hair stylers while leaving hair twice as smooth.

At the core of the device is near-infrared light, which sits just beyond the visible light spectrum. This wavelength penetrates deeply into the hair fibre, reshaping the internal hydrogen bonds that determine hair texture and form. By targeting these bonds directly, the Light Straight + Multi-styler aims to achieve the desired styling effect while preserving the integrity of the hair cuticle, keeping hair smoother, shinier and stronger over time.

Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of Augmented Beauty and Open Innovation at L’Oréal Groupe, described the device as a shift from corrective styling to preventative care. He said limiting cumulative heat exposure from the outset helps protect the natural structure of hair, setting a new standard for precision styling and redefining expectations within the hairstyling category.

Beyond straightening, the Light Straight + Multi-styler is designed as a versatile, multi-function tool. It can also be used to curl hair, offering users greater flexibility without requiring multiple devices. The product incorporates smart internal sensors powered by proprietary algorithms and machine learning, allowing it to adapt to user gestures and deliver more personalised results.

The launch builds on L’Oréal’s earlier introduction of the Airlight Pro hair dryer, first revealed at CES 2024, which also uses infrared light technology. Together, the two devices form a complete infrared-based hairstyling routine focused on minimising damage while maintaining performance. The Light Straight + Multi-styler is scheduled for global release in 2027, with pricing details to be announced closer to launch.

LED Face Mask targets visible ageing with precision light therapy

Alongside its hairstyling innovation, L’Oréal also introduced the development of an LED Face Mask, further expanding its use of light technology into skincare. Currently in prototype form, the ultra-thin mask is made from flexible silicone and is designed to deliver targeted light therapy directly to the face. It was developed in collaboration with iSmart, a specialist in LED device innovation.

The LED Face Mask uses a combination of red light and near-infrared light, which L’Oréal believes will help combat visible signs of ageing, including fine lines, sagging and uneven skin tone. Each session lasts 10 minutes and is automatically timed, allowing the device to fit easily into daily skincare routines without adding complexity.

A key feature of the mask is its transparent support structure, which integrates a skin-safe microcircuit to precisely control light emission. The device delivers two specific wavelengths: red light at 630 nanometres and near-infrared light at 830 nanometres. These wavelengths are selected for their ability to visibly firm and smooth skin while promoting a more even tone, according to L’Oréal’s testing assumptions.

The design prioritises comfort and usability. Its lightweight, non-invasive construction allows it to sit closely against the skin, ensuring consistent light delivery across the face. By focusing on controlled, targeted exposure, L’Oréal aims to maximise visible results while maintaining safety and ease of use.

The LED Face Mask is expected to launch in 2027. In the United States, its release will be subject to the FDA 510(k) premarket notification process. As with the Light Straight + Multi-styler, pricing and additional specifications will be shared closer to commercial availability.

Together, the two CES 2026 showcases underline L’Oréal’s continued investment in longevity science, personalised beauty and device-led innovation. With a global research network spanning 21 centres across 13 countries and thousands of scientists and digital specialists, the group is positioning light-based technology as a core pillar of its future product strategy, extending beyond topical formulations into hardware that reshapes how consumers approach haircare and skincare at home.",https://www.techedt.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LOreal-brings-infrared-light-technology-to-hair-and-skincare-with-two-new-beauty-tech-innovations-at-CES-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 11:03:35.349651

LONDON, Jan. 6, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) and The All England Lawn Tennis Club today announced a multi-year renewal of their long-standing, landmark technology partnership. From the launch of the Wimbledon website in 1995 and the mobile application in 2009, to the first integration of enhanced AI-powered solutions in 2017, IBM and the All England Club have collaborated for 36 years to deepen global fan engagement across Wimbledon's world-class digital platforms.

The successful partnership between IBM and the All England Club has long set the standard for creating engaging fan-facing features that have raised the bar for tech innovation in sport. Building on more than three decades of continuous innovation, the new agreement is focused on initiatives to expand the event's global reach and achieve a deeper fan engagement across Wimbledon's digital ecosystem in 2026 and beyond.

Teams from IBM and the All England Club work together year-round to co-create unique fan experiences – such as Live Likelihood to Win and Match Chat – that combine the significant quantity of data generated during The Championships with the deep AI capabilities of IBM watsonx. In 2025, these efforts contributed to a 16% year-on-year increase in engagement across all platforms, with more than 20 million fans closely following all the grass court action via the app and website. The app alone saw a 19% increase in engagement and received an outstanding average rating of 4.9 stars in app stores.

The partnership has also won multiple awards, including the All England Club being recognised as 'Sports Organisation of the Year' at the 2025 Sports Technology Awards, for the innovative use of AI and technology to transform the Wimbledon fan experience.

The FTC sued Instacart for deceptive practices including misleading ""free delivery,"" unclear satisfaction guarantees, undisclosed fees, and unlawful free-trial-to-paid memberships. Instacart has now reached a $60 million settlement to refund hundreds of thousands of consumers and impose future compliance restrictions.

Investigations found that Instacart's algorithmic pricing experiments led to significant price disparities (up to 23% higher for some users), exacerbating consumer frustration amid already high grocery prices and raising concerns about fairness and transparency.

The case reinforces that traditional consumer protection laws apply to AI-enabled markets. While the White House's AI Action Plan promotes innovation and minimal new regulation, it preserves FTC authority to enforce transparency, consent, and fairness in automated systems.

The action highlights a growing divide between consumer advocates, who argue automated and personalized systems can scale consumer harm and require strong enforcement, and industry groups, who warn that aggressive enforcement may chill AI innovation, investment, and competitive experimentation.

FTC's Settlement Action Against Instacart Reinforces Need for AI Systems Regulation

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Instacart for engaging in numerous deceptive tactics against consumers through unclear labels and disclosures, resulting in raised grocery prices and recurring memberships without consent. Instacart has agreed to settle through paying $60 million in refunds to affected customers.

Other internal and external research had already shown how Instacart's AI-driven pricing experiments impacted various family budgets. It was found that some quoted prices to consumers were up to approximately 23% higher than those shown to others, even for the same cart and time.

This AI-powered pricing tool, known as Eversight, allows for retailers to conduct price tests to gauge reactions of consumers and efficiency to higher and lower prices across different categories of items. Instacart's website noted that grocers who use this tool ""see revenue growth of 1 to 3%."" Instacart claimed these tests were randomized and, among other companies utilizing this tool, was scrutinized, emphasizing that ""consumers deserve to know when they are being placed into pricing tests. The FTC should require a prominent on-screen label,"" as stated by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).

The practice of dynamic pricing raised concerns and increased consumer frustration with grocery prices already being at significantly higher levels. Reports from several nonprofit consumer advocacy groups found that the prices of items in Instacart baskets varied by an average of 7% across 437 shoppers in four cities testing for the same items at the same stores. Shortly after, the FTC sent Instacart a civil investigative demand for further information on Eversight.

This recent enforcement action against Instacart is an example of how traditional consumer protection principles continue to apply in increasingly automated and technology-driven markets. It reinforces that representations made and marketed to consumers about pricing, fees, or savings must be transparent, regardless of them being generated or influenced by algorithms or other advanced technologies.

The AI Action Plan released by the White House this past summer, while emphasizing the importance of fostering innovation and competition in artificial intelligence, does not carve out exemptions from existing consumer protection laws. It explicitly preserves and reinforces the role of agencies such as the FTC in addressing unfair or deceptive practices involving AI-enabled systems, as we previously covered. The enforcement action is grounded in traditional consumer protection law by addressing false advertising, undisclosed fees, and unfair practices harming shoppers. In contrast, the AI Action Plan leans toward market-friendly AI adoption and minimal federal constraints, leaving Big Tech and startups to consider how AI systems interact with consumer rights.

In the complaint, three components of Instacart's deceptive tactics were highlighted:

""Free Delivery"" Promotion

Instacart often advertised ""free delivery"" to new consumers on their first three orders, insinuating the absence of additional fees. This promotion was alleged to be false, as every order placed for delivery requires additional ""service fees"" to be paid for consumers to get their items delivered. In the complaint, the FTC stated that Instacart misrepresented certain charges by another name, despite functioning the same as delivery fees, whether they were service fees or small order add-ons. Both are related to delivery, with Instacart using them to offset costs.

There was an alleged failure to prominently disclose that service fees may apply, and consumers would only see this upon reaching the checkout screen at the end. Instacart's own internal research found that consumers felt this offer to be a ""bait and switch,"" with many users spending significant time on orders only to be met with hidden fees.

""100% Satisfaction Guarantee"" Protection

Instacart advertises that consumers can receive a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a refund if they are not fully satisfied with their services. This has been alleged to be misleading, as many consumers who were seeking refunds — e.g., for late deliveries — received appeasement in forms of credit that can only be used for future orders instead of original payment. The amount refunded was also almost always less than what the customer originally paid.

Per the written terms of Instacart's guarantee, it is only applicable to the fees paid on the order instead of the total cost. Previously, customers were able to access a self-service interface on Instacart's website and mobile app to report issues with orders and receive refunds without having to contact customer service. In 2022, the refund option was hidden to shift more consumers toward credits rather than refunding to the original form of payment.

Unlawful ""Free Trials"" into Paid Instacart+ Memberships

Instacart has a membership available for purchase, Instacart+, which allows for members to receive $0 delivery fees on orders over $10. Plans include a $99 annual membership and a monthly membership of $9.99 per month. To further entice consumers, Instacart provides several free trials, one specifically taking place for 14 days. Aside from the fine print at the bottom of screens on the mobile platform, there is no specific distinction on the amount that will be charged once the free trial ends, often it being the $99 annual membership.

The fine print ensures consumers that they can ""cancel anytime,"" yet when consumers realize they have been charged for a full membership without their consent and attempt to cancel it, they do not receive refunds despite not having placed any orders after being charged. The FTC asserted that there is no clear distinction of which membership is going to be charged and no consensual way for consumers to agree to continuing their subscription after the trial.

Next Steps for Instacart

Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to settle the claims; the funds will be routed into a refund program and distributed to consumers who were charged misleading fees or enrolled in Instacart's recurring membership without clear consent. The FTC has stated that this payout will reach hundreds of thousands of affected customers, representing the wide-scale impact of Instacart's practices over many years.

Additionally, under the FTC's proposed settlement order, Instacart will be prohibited from making future misrepresentations about delivery costs, service fees, and guarantees per refunds, and will no longer be able to automatically enroll customers in paid memberships unless they opt in. Instacart has also been asked to bar its pricing tools driven by AI and various algorithms to ensure customers see accurate totals ""at a time when families are working hard to stretch their grocery budgets.""

Future Moves for Tech Companies and Consumer Protection

Consumer advocacy groups support the FTC's action, arguing that it demonstrates the continued relevance of traditional consumer protection laws as AI is developed. They emphasize that AI-enabled systems can increase harm at scale as well as the need for enforcement when deceptive practices are automated or personalized, signifying that companies must proactively audit AI tools for consumer harm to prevent such risks.

In contrast, several industry stakeholders and innovation-focused policy groups warn that aggressive enforcement could slow AI adoption and experimentation. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal and other pro-market commentators argue that algorithmic pricing tests and personalized user experiences are tools that can increase efficiency and consumer choice if properly deployed. They prefer federal guidance over enforcement-driven regulation surrounding AI compliance, with concerns that over-regulation may deter investment and disadvantage US companies in global competition.

Legal and policy experts argue that while the White House's AI Action Plan emphasizes deregulation and national competitiveness, it does not preempt agencies like the FTC from applying established statutes to AI-enabled conduct. The Tech Policy Press stated that it ""stifles local initiatives to uphold civil rights and shield communities from biased AI systems."" Companies are often then faced with dual options of fewer AI-specific rules but continued exposure to enforcement under general consumer protection standards.

Ultimately, the FTC's settlement order of Instacart highlights the unresolved tension at the center of AI governance and how best to encourage innovation and efficiency without eroding basic consumer protections. As pro-market voices caution that aggressive enforcement can impact beneficial experimentation, the FTC's action affirms that automation does not absolve companies of transparency, consent, or fairness obligations.

Real talk: is A stock a game-changer or just background noise in your portfolio?

The internet is sleeping on Agilent Technologies Inc – but should you? While everyone chases the next meme coin or AI rocket, this lab-tech heavyweight is quietly powering pharma, biotech, semis, and more. Real talk: is A stock actually worth your money, or just boomer science vibes?

We pulled fresh market data, checked multiple finance sources, and scanned the social feeds so you do not have to. Here is what is really going on with Agilent right now.

Stock data check: Based on live data pulled on 2026-01-05 around 20:00 UTC, Agilent Technologies Inc (ticker: A) was trading near the mid 140s in USD, with a market cap hovering in the tens of billions. Figures were cross-checked using at least two major finance platforms. If markets are closed when you read this, treat that as a last known zone, not a current quote.

The Hype is Real: Agilent Technologies Inc on TikTok and Beyond

Agilent is not some flashy consumer gadget brand, so you will not see unboxing videos every five seconds. But zoom in on nerd-Tok, biotech-Tok, and finance creators, and you start seeing a pattern: people who know what this company actually does are taking it seriously.

Think of Agilent as the backstage crew for the entire science show. Their instruments and software help drug makers test new meds, chip producers measure microscopic defects, and labs everywhere keep their data clean and legit. It is not viral on its own – but everything viral in health and tech kind of runs through companies like this.

Social clout right now is more “respect” than “hype-beast”. You are not getting the explosive virality of the latest AI darling, but there is a steady stream of analysts, engineers, and lab creators calling Agilent a “must-have backbone” for serious research and production.

Is it flooding your For You Page? No. But in the corners of the internet where people talk real money and real science, Agilent is definitely on the radar.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So, is Agilent Technologies Inc a game-changer or a total flop for your portfolio? Let us break it down into three key angles you actually care about.

1. The Business Model: Picks-and-Shovels to Science

Agilent sells the stuff everyone else needs to do the cool things. Instruments, diagnostics, software, lab tools. Instead of trying to guess which single drug, chip, or therapy wins, Agilent gets paid by the companies fighting those battles.

This “picks-and-shovels” vibe means: when biotech, semis, and advanced materials are booming, Agilent can quietly ride multiple waves at once. It is less about going viral and more about being impossible to skip in high-end labs.

2. Price Performance: Is It Worth the Hype?

Recent share price action for A has lived in that classic quality-stock pattern: pullbacks when the market panics about rates or funding for biotech, followed by slow, stubborn comebacks when earnings show the underlying demand is still there.

Here is the real talk: this is not a lottery ticket. You are paying up for quality, stability, and long-term relevance. The valuation is usually not dirt cheap, but dips and corrections can turn it into a no-brainer for long-term holders who are fine skipping the day-trading drama.

If you are chasing a quick viral spike, this probably is not it. If you are cool stacking a science-backed, cash-generating name and letting time cook, it starts to look a lot more attractive.

3. Risk Level: Boring or Beautiful?

Agilent’s risk is more about macro and sector cycles than the company suddenly vanishing. If funding for pharma, life sciences, and advanced manufacturing slows down, lab budgets get tight and orders can slip. That is when the stock usually feels heavy.

But when innovation spending ramps back up – new drugs, new chips, new testing needs – companies like Agilent often quietly rebound. It is less roller coaster, more long, bumpy upward hike.

So is it worth the hype? If your hype is defined as stable growth, science exposure, and compounding… then yes. If your hype means moonshot overnight, then not really.

Agilent Technologies Inc vs. The Competition

No stock lives in a vacuum, and Agilent has some serious rivals in the high-end lab-tech game. Think Thermo Fisher, Danaher, Waters, and a few other heavy-hitters.

Main Rival Spotlight: Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)

Thermo Fisher is the big boss in this space – massive scale, deep product lines, huge reputation. When investors want “lab-tech blue chip,” TMO is often their first thought.

Clout War:

Thermo Fisher wins on name recognition and sheer size. Agilent wins on being a bit more focused, slightly more agile, and heavily tied to precision instruments and analytics that labs obsessed with data quality love.

Innovation Energy:

Both companies pour cash into R&D, but Agilent’s edge shows up in specialized analytical tools, chromatography, mass spec, and lab software that power serious research workflows. In the nerd corners of Reddit and professional forums, you will see real debates about whose instruments people prefer – and Agilent regularly gets love for usability and reliability.

Who Wins?

If you want the mega-conglomerate, all-in-one lab empire, Thermo Fisher probably wins. If you want a leaner, more instrument-and-analytics-focused play with strong margins and a bit more under-the-radar upside, Agilent has serious appeal.

From a clout angle, Thermo is the mainstream headliner. Agilent is the cult-favorite artist with a loyal fanbase. And sometimes, that cult favorite has the better performance upside when the crowd finally catches on.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So where do we land on Agilent Technologies Inc as an investment and as a hype play?

Social Sentiment: Not viral in the TikTok-sense, but strong respect among pros, finance creators, and science channels. This is more “must-have infrastructure” than “trending toy.”

Game-Changer Level: For your daily life? You might never touch an Agilent product. For the labs building the future of medicine, chips, and materials? Huge. Their tech is core to how experiments get done and verified.

Price Drop Potential: When the macro mood turns risk-off or funding fears hit biotech and semis, Agilent can see pullbacks. Those dips are when long-term investors quietly start circling.

Real Talk Verdict:

If you want fast thrills: probably a drop.

If you want a long-term, quality, science-backed name that benefits from multiple innovation trends without having to pick one winner: strong cop, especially on weakness.

This is the opposite of a meme stock: slow, serious, compounder energy. If that fits your strategy, Agilent deserves a hard look.

The Business Side: A

Time to talk pure market facts on Agilent Technologies Inc, ticker A, ISIN US00846U1016.

Recent trading action has the stock sitting in that mid-to-upper quality range: not penny stock cheap, not mega-cap stretched, but very much in the lane of a mature, profitable science company that the market already respects.

Analysts generally frame Agilent as a steady compounder rather than a moon mission. Revenue streams are spread across multiple end markets – pharma and biotech, diagnostics, chemicals, environment, and advanced manufacturing. That mix gives the business some defense when one vertical slows down.

On the fundamentals side, investors usually highlight:

Healthy margins for a hardware-plus-software business.

Recurring revenue from consumables, services, and software – not just one-off instrument sales.

Solid balance sheet vibes compared with more speculative tech names.

For US-based investors, A is a classic “own a slice of the lab infrastructure” move. You are not betting on one pill, one chip design, or one hot AI app – you are backing the toolbox companies use to build and test all of that.

If you are building a portfolio around themes like healthcare innovation, semiconductor quality, clean tech, or advanced materials, Agilent deserves a seat at the table. It might not trend on your FYP, but it could quietly trend in your portfolio statement over the long haul.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405030_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:03:09.977101

In Mexico, Walmart’s Cashi already had scale. What it needed next was the kind of regulated payments infrastructure that cannot be built overnight. Rather than rely on a global incumbent, Walmart acquired Trafalgar Asset Management’s (TAM) fintech arm, Trafalgar Digital, and used it to strengthen Cashi’s financial stack.

Among the firms building regulated, tech-first financial platforms in Mexico, TAM stands out.

In recent years, TAM has expanded beyond traditional investment activity to build infrastructure, governance and data capabilities that translate into practical financial services.

Through disciplined partnerships and incremental capability builds, rather than rapid feature sprawl, TAM has helped widen access to modern financial services while keeping governance front and centre.

A platform built for SMEs and regulation

The investor group, steered by Porfirio Sánchez-Talavera, has built a platform approach anchored in regulated infrastructure and scalable technology.

Across TAM’s fintech arm (Trafalgar Digital) and neobanking arm (Trafalgar SFP), the group applies AI, data analytics and automation to improve decisioning and customer experience, without compromising human oversight and regulatory discipline.

Trafalgar’s initiative to enhance its capabilities was undertaken with a particular demographic in mind.

Rather than casting a wide net, the firm focused on building infrastructure tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

SMEs often face higher friction as slower underwriting, limited product fit and higher cost of capital, makes speed, data quality and governance decisive.

From local infrastructure to scalable impact

This specialisation enabled the group to pursue licensing and supervision with Mexico’s banking and securities regulator (CNBV).

The groundwork supported the launch of Trafalgar SFP as a SOFIPO, broadening the group’s ability to serve SMEs by providing access to formal credit and long-term growth pathways.

That strategy paid off. In April 2023, Walmart acquired Trafalgar Digital, integrating a regulated platform into Cashi’s fintech strategy and accelerating services such as real-time SPEI transfers.

By October 2025, Trafalgar SFP began operating as an authorised SOFIPO.

Trafalgar’s trajectory acts as a blueprint for scaling financial services through modern infrastructure and regulatory discipline, a model recognised in 2025 with shortlisting in two Banking Tech Awards categories, including Best Use of Tech in SME Banking.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8027e75518bb8aed5a1cb0b654ba0d11:9cce214811bf409d2e01de4528228ee2/trafalgar-building.jpeg.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:02:22.056435

Shares of tax preparation company H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) jumped 3% in the afternoon session after investors wagered geopolitical tension would be contained following the U.S. military's operation in Venezuela, with the Dow hitting a fresh record.

Sentiment remained firmly ""risk-on"" for early 2026, with Wall Street prioritizing domestic economic strength over foreign turbulence. Analysts noted that while the event raises short-term supply questions, the market largely viewed the potential stabilization of Venezuela's vast oil reserves as a long-term economic positive.

The shares closed the day at $43.71, up 2.6% from previous close.

What Is The Market Telling Us

H&R Block’s shares are not very volatile and have only had 5 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful, although it might not be something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 5 months ago when the stock dropped 6% on the news that the company reported mixed second-quarter results, as an earnings miss and weaker-than-expected guidance for the upcoming fiscal year overshadowed a slight revenue beat.

The tax preparation company posted adjusted earnings per share of $2.27, well below analyst expectations of $2.83. Although revenue came in slightly ahead of forecasts at $1.11 billion, the focus remained on profitability. The earnings miss was partly due to a one-time tax benefit of $0.50 per share being pushed to the next quarter. Looking ahead, H &R Block's earnings forecast for fiscal 2026 of $4.85 to $5.00 per share also fell short of consensus estimates.

H&R Block is up 2.6% since the beginning of the year, but at $43.71 per share, it is still trading 30.7% below its 52-week high of $63.04 from April 2025.

In Las Vegas on Monday, the ride-hailing company announced that it was developing a driverless robotaxi prototype with EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle company Nuro.

While not as futuristic as Tesla’s Cybercab concept or Amazon’s Zoox, which has no steering wheel, the still unnamed Uber-designed version of Lucid’s Gravity EV is expected to arrive in the San Francisco Bay Area at some point this year. It’ll join Waymo and Zoox robotaxis already on the road there. The companies said that on-road testing started at the end of last year, which isn’t surprising as Nuro already holds driverless testing permits through the California DMV. In fact, Nuro-branded autonomous vehicles started popping up on San Francisco streets last month.

Eventually, the trio plan to offer the Level 4 robotaxi prototype everywhere Uber has a presence — if all goes well, that is.

Monday’s big announcement provided us with the first look at what the prototype, which at its core is a repurposed Lucid Gravity, could look like. At first glance, the prototype takes advantage of Nuro’s autonomous last-mile delivery know-how and Nvidia’s Drive Hyperion platform for real-time AI processing.

The passenger experience is indeed a combination of all the companies involved in this robotaxi project. Inside it looks like the Gravity, which seats up to six adults and has a large hatchback trunk for luggage, but has some robotaxi hallmarks like touchscreens, which allow you to customize the ride and control the interior climate, activate heated seats, and set music choices. In terms of support, the car features an autonomous vehicle customer support button and emergency stop setting.

In addition, the screens show passengers what the robotaxi sees on the road—similar to the way Waymo shows pedestrians, traffic signals, and other cars—all in real-time.

Less noticeable is the prototype’s sensor suite, which includes high-res cameras, solid-state LiDAR sensors, and radars. The sensors are built into the Gravity exterior and more visible on the roof, where it looks like a roof rack is riding on top of the Gravity.

Lights on this roof rack sensor unit will light up with different colors, display passenger initials (just like Waymo), and provide status updates, the companies said.

Missing from the announcement was more information about how customers could hail one of these robotaxis or get access to the cars once they start production. If I had to bet, I imagine that everything will be tied into the existing Uber app.

The robotaxi prototype is expected to be built at Lucid’s Arizona factory at some point later this year. Of course, it’ll have to pass autonomous validation benchmarks first before being deployed.

With Monday’s announcement, Uber’s efforts (and notorious failures) to take on autonomous driving on its own are officially gone.

ID38,Ralph Lauren,2026-01-06 11:03:15+00:00,Modern Retail,Why the AI shopping agent wars will heat up in 2026 - Modern Retail,Allison Smith,,,,,https://www.modernretail.co/technology/why-the-ai-shopping-agent-wars-will-heat-up-in-2026/,"But throughout 2025, new AI shopping agents sprouted left and right.
Alongside the big tech players, a wave of niche AI shopping startups emerged in 2025.
To win the AI agent shopping race, platforms will need to win over customers.
For those reasons, AI shopping startups with a specialized focus like Daydream may have a competitive edge against more mainstream AI tools heading into 2026.
Ultimately, the biggest hurdle facing any AI agent will be consumer adoption, according to Swap’s Pellerano-Rendón.","That dilemma is what led Bornstein to create Daydream, an AI-powered shopping platform focused on fashion. Daydream, which is still in beta, launched in June, a year after the company announced $50 million in seed funding. The platform lets users describe what they’re looking for in conversational language — or by uploading a photo — and receive personalized product recommendations in response.

Daydream is one of a growing number of tech startups, retailers and brands racing to hand off parts of the shopping journey to AI-powered agents — tools designed to research, recommend and, in some cases, buy products on a consumer’s behalf. In 2025, nearly every major retailer or AI incumbent entered the race for “agentic” commerce. Amazon expanded its Rufus shopping assistant with a new automatic-buying feature; OpenAI embedded checkout directly into ChatGPT; and Perplexity rolled out an AI-powered browser that prompted legal pushback from Amazon over how it accessed its site.

If 2025 was the year that companies laid the groundwork for agentic commerce, then 2026 will be the year retailers, tech giants and startups jockey to determine whose AI agent becomes the default interface for shopping — if consumers even adopt these AI agents en masse at all.

“We’re pre–Sputnik launch phase,” said Juan Pellerano-Rendón, chief marketing officer at e-commerce software startup Swap, which launched a new platform in September that creates AI shopping agents for brands to offer on their sites. “Everyone is building the spaceship, but no one has really launched it yet.”

Winning the buy box

Perplexity got a head start in the agentic shopping race when it unveiled an AI shopping agent for its U.S. subscribers in November 2024 that lets paying users research and buy products directly within Perplexity’s app or website.

But throughout 2025, new AI shopping agents sprouted left and right. Since September, OpenAI has announced several deals with major retailers — the latest partners include Target, Instacart and DoorDash — to let shoppers buy from their platforms directly within ChatGPT. Amazon released an agentic tool called “Buy For Me” that lets consumers shop other brands’ and retailers’ websites without leaving Amazon’s app. Even brands, including luxury players like Ralph Lauren, are launching their own AI-powered shopping assistants.

Alongside the big tech players, a wave of niche AI shopping startups emerged in 2025. New apps like Phia, a price-comparison platform co-founded by Phoebe Gates, and OneOff, which recommends products based on celebrity and creator looks, are targeting specific shopping use cases rather than trying to do everything at once. Even as these startups face competition from AI giants like OpenAI, investor interest remains strong. Phia, for instance, raised $8 million in September.

It’s still early days, and for the time being, shopping only accounts for a fraction of overall AI use. According to a working paper authored by OpenAI’s Economic Research team and a Harvard economist, around 2% of all ChatGPT queries are shopping-related — things like “recommend a laptop under $1,000” and “how much are running shoes.” Still, that comes to around 50 million shopping queries daily. Even a sliver of that activity could translate into enormous volume at scale.

The allure of agentic shopping is easy to understand. Online shopping has become overwhelming, with millions of products spread across multiple retailers, marketplaces and DTC sites, plus endless filters, ads and reviews to sort through. An AI agent, in theory, promises a shortcut: Instead of clicking around, shoppers can describe what they’re looking for in a sentence or two and get a short list of options that fit their needs. The idea is that the agent handles the busywork — weighing price, availability and quality — so shoppers can move more quickly toward a purchase.

To win the AI agent shopping race, platforms will need to win over customers. To some extent, that may give companies like OpenAI and Amazon an advantage because they can introduce agentic commerce features inside products consumers already use habitually. OpenAI announced in October that ChatGPT has reached 800 million weekly active users, up from 500 million in March. Meanwhile, Amazon captures 40% of all U.S. e-commerce spending, and 90% of its shoppers begin their searches directly on Amazon.com.

Scot Wingo, author of the Substack Retailgentic and founder of ReFiBuy, a company that helps brands and retailers optimize for agentic AI, said the quality of agents’ product recommendations will ultimately determine which platforms gain consumer trust. “GenAI knows far more about the shopper than Google ever did; the job now is to expand and contextualize the product catalog so the engine can map that shopper context to the right SKU,” he said. “There’s a big gap between tight, keywordy product catalogs and the context GenAI needs.”

In other words, shopping agents are only as good as the data they can access — and that’s where things get complicated. To make accurate recommendations, agents need more granular and standardized information — not just basic attributes, but detailed descriptions of fit, quality, durability, shipping timelines and inventory status. For decades, merchants have structured their product catalogs around search engine optimization, designed to match short, keyword-based queries rather than long, descriptive requests.

Shoppers now give AI agents far more context — dozens of words about who they are, how they’ll use a product and what they prefer — but most product catalogs were never built to absorb or respond to that level of detail. Closing that gap would require brands to add far richer context to every product, a labor-intensive process that goes well beyond basic fields like price or size. And some of the information agents would need is considered proprietary, so some merchants may be reluctant to share it with third-party AI platforms.

“Even if these agents don’t bother with the transaction and just offer themselves up as an alternative to Google search, there is still a lot of creating new information in new formats for each product that every merchant will need to do,” said Sucharita Kodali, a principal analyst at Forrester. “There will no doubt be holdouts.”

That tension is already shaping how the agentic shopping market is developing. Unlike many other retailers that have inked partnerships with third-party AI companies like OpenAI, Amazon has blocked off its site from outside agents. The move was likely intended to protect its $56 billion advertising business, which depends on shoppers browsing Amazon’s site, Modern Retail previously reported. Earlier this year, Amazon sued Perplexity, arguing that the AI startup improperly accessed its site, a legal fight that underscored how high the stakes have become as platforms jockey to control the future of AI-driven commerce.

But while the rise of AI shopping agents from ChatGPT to Daydream challenges Amazon, the e-commerce giant doesn’t need to worry about its retail empire being upended just yet, according to Kodali. That’s because Amazon already has stored payment credentials, consumer trust and habitual usage. In a July survey of 700 consumers conducted by Forrester, only about a third said they would be willing to complete payment through an answer engine at all, citing data privacy concerns.

To gain traction with consumers, and compete with the likes of Amazon, AI companies like OpenAI “need to get shoppers on board and convince them that it’s better to buy on ChatGPT than on a retailer’s website, which usually a third party can only do if the assortment is bigger or if the products are cheaper,” Kodali said. “So long as Amazon is a player in e-commerce, I don’t see ChatGPT ever winning the buy box over Amazon.”

Not the finish line

Building an AI agent specifically for shopping is no easy feat. Users shop with nuanced, conversational requests — “a dress for a wedding in Paris in the fall,” for example — which involve interpreting multiple factors — occasion, seasonality, location, style, color, fabric, price point and more, sometimes in a single query, Bornstein said. Standard LLMs struggle to reliably extract all pertinent details at once, often omitting or misinterpreting elements.

Indeed, Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy recently told analysts that most AI shopping agents fail to provide a satisfactory customer experience. He said most lack personalization and often provide inaccurate pricing and delivery estimates. “We’ve got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange of value,” he said in October. Bloomberg reported that product recommendations from Amazon’s Rufus, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Walmart’s Sparky elicited fairly generic results when asked what to buy mom for Christmas.

Rather than relying on keyword searches or static filters, Daydream uses multiple AI models to interpret factors like occasion, seasonality and personal style. For those reasons, AI shopping startups with a specialized focus like Daydream may have a competitive edge against more mainstream AI tools heading into 2026. Bornstein declined to share revenue figures, but she said the platform’s catalog includes nearly 2 million products spanning more than 8,000 brands.

Ultimately, the biggest hurdle facing any AI agent will be consumer adoption, according to Swap’s Pellerano-Rendón. “There’s no innovation without utility,” he said, arguing that agents won’t improve unless consumers see enough value to keep using them. Right now, he said, the industry is stuck in a “chicken or egg phase,” where “the agent needs to get better, but also the consumers need to use it for it to get better.” Until shoppers consistently experience moments where an agent truly understands what they want — what he described as a “needle in the haystack feeling” — adoption will remain slow. “We’re still super, super early days, in terms of how people are using agents to shop,” he said.

Bornstein agreed.

“It’s going to take longer to perfect these experiences than anyone thinks,” she said. “It will happen, but 2026 will be a step along the way, not the finish line.”",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/12/Agentic-AI-.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:04:14.544435

The S&P Global UK services PMI business activity index edged higher to 51.4 points in December from 51.3 in November, but underperformed against the flash reading of 52.1.

The reading remained above the neutral 50-point mark separating growth from contraction, and indicated a rise in business activity for the eighth successive month.

The seasonally adjusted S&P Global UK composite PMI output index, a blend of the service and manufacturing sector readings, rose to 51.4 points in December from 51.2 in November to remain in expansion territory for the eight month in a row. However, it missed the flash estimate of 52.1 points.

""Lacklustre business activity growth continued across the UK service sector at the end of 2025,"" commented Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Moreover, the speed of expansion was softer than signalled by the earlier 'flash' survey in December and lower than seen on average in the second half of the year.""

He added that survey respondents ""noted sales headwinds linked to weak UK economic prospects, alongside challenging operating conditions due to factors such as sharply rising business costs and soft demand in major overseas markets.""

Previously on Friday, S&P Global reported that UK manufacturing showed further signs of stabilisation at the end of 2025.

Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.
(Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)
Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year.
Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.","In another district or another time, Representative Daniel Goldman of New York City would probably coast to re-election for his safely Democratic seat.

He is a well-spoken former prosecutor with liberal bona fides and a vast personal fortune. He won plaudits as the House’s chief investigator during President Trump’s first impeachment, and could reprise that role if Democrats take back the chamber.

But as he formally begins his campaign for a third term on Tuesday, Mr. Goldman, 49, is instead girding for the fight of his political life as he faces a primary challenge from Brad Lander, a popular former city official.

These are not easy times to be a Democratic incumbent, after all. With Mr. Trump upending Washington and rattling the world order, the party’s voters are actively reconsidering how their leaders should fight back and what they should stand for on issues including the economy and Gaza.

Mr. Lander, 56, has spent weeks contending that Mr. Goldman’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza has defied the residents of his Brooklyn and Manhattan district, and that his lawyerly approach is too timid for the moment. The challenger has the backing of the city’s politically powerful new mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Now, Mr. Goldman is ready to have his say.

He will declare his candidacy on Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with a video highlighting his successes constraining Mr. Trump in court and Congress and his support for left-leaning policies like Medicare for All and a tax hike on the wealthy.

In an expansive interview over lunch at a diner in Manhattan’s Chinatown, Mr. Goldman pointed to a successful lawsuit he helped bring that forced Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to grant members of Congress access to immigration holding cells as proof of concept.

“My approach to the job is to get results,” he said, “not revolutions.”

Mr. Goldman took swipes at Mr. Lander, arguing that his rival was only running for Congress as a fallback after Mr. Mamdani did not hire him for his administration. (Mr. Lander has rejected that suggestion.)

The congressman also questioned whether the activist tactics Mr. Lander had embraced — he was arrested last June at the immigration courthouse at 26 Federal Plaza while trying to escort a migrant facing detention — were actually effective.

“Civil disobedience is a very valid and important way to protest,” he said. “But I don’t know whether a single person has benefited from that other than perhaps Brad Lander, because he gets a lot of attention for it.”

And Mr. Goldman said he had resigned himself to the fact that his support for Israel, which he called central to his faith and his worldview, could come at a political cost as polls show Democratic opinions moving against the American ally after years of war.

“I understood that ran the risk of engendering a primary,” he said. But, he added that he had tried to make decisions around the conflict based on “what I genuinely thought was best for the state of Israel, the people of Israel, Palestinian civilians and the future state of Palestine.”

But the race between Mr. Goldman and Mr. Lander in New York’s 10th District may be among the highest wattage.

Connecting Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn, the district leans clearly to the left and voted decisively for Mr. Mamdani in November. It includes Wall Street, two Chinatowns, liberal affluent neighborhoods of brownstone Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish community of Borough Park.

Mr. Goldman, a Levi Strauss heir with little background in city politics, narrowly won the seat in 2022, when he spent nearly $5 million of his own money and progressive support fractured among three other candidates.

Since then, he has had one of the most liberal voting records in Congress. Like Mr. Lander, Mr. Goldman supports Mr. Mamdani’s proposals to provide universal, government-funded child care; to raise taxes on wealthy New Yorkers; and to create a new department of community safety to shift some responsibility from the Police Department.

His work on immigration has not been limited to court. He has turned his Lower Manhattan office, which sits just across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, into a triage center to help connect families of migrants who are detained with social and legal services.

“There are folks who believe that because of my presence there, far fewer arrests are made,” he said.

But progressives have always been wary of Mr. Goldman — of his wealth, his relatively shallow ties to community groups and, above all in recent years, his positions on Israel and the war in Gaza.

Mr. Goldman has repeatedly voted to send American military aid to Israel, and he declined to endorse Mr. Mamdani over concerns about his sharp criticism of the country. (Mr. Goldman says he wrote in State Senator Zellnor Myrie’s name on Election Day.)

Progressives were particularly upset when, not long after the war began, Mr. Goldman voted to censure Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, for her statements relating to it.

Many are now backing Mr. Lander, who raised his profile while running in the Democratic primary for mayor last year. Like Mr. Goldman, Mr. Lander is Jewish and considers himself a Zionist.

But he has moved leftward with his party’s base, supporting putting conditions on certain U.S. military aid to Israel and blocking the transfer of bombs and other heavy weapons outright. More than two years after the war began, he started calling Israel’s actions in Gaza a genocide, a position few other Jewish elected officials have taken.

Among Mr. Lander’s supporters is Assemblyman Robert Carroll, a Brooklyn Democrat who endorsed Mr. Goldman in 2022, and now calls that decision “one of the poorest choices I made.”

“He did not just turn a cold shoulder on his constituents,” Mr. Carroll said recently. “He told his constituents he knew better.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06met-goldman-01-wjmk/06met-goldman-01-wjmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:58:46.658101

Plastic bags will be provided to shoppers who are buying meat and seafood products.
New York’s plastic bag ban has been in place since March 2020.","WALMART shoppers who headed to supermarkets in recent days may be in line for a refund.

That’s because some customers were accidentally overcharged as a result of a law coming into force on January 1.

Officials in Richmond County, Virginia, rolled out a new five-cent tax on disposable plastic bags.

But, shoppers in another county were slapped with the extra charge.

Walmart customers who shopped at stores in Henrico County were affected.

And, the supermarket chain has broken its silence.

“Some customers shopping at Walmart locations in Henrico County on Brook Rd, Forest Ave and N Parham Rd might have been mistakenly charged for Richmond City’s new 5-cent tax on disposable plastic bags starting Jan. 1, 2026,” a spokesperson told the ABC affiliate WRIC-TV.

“We’re providing refunds to customers in those cases.”

Matt Chafin, who works as a Henrico County official, also revealed some Dollar Tree and CVS shoppers were affected.

Other city and state officials implemented bag-related policies on January 1.

Montgomery County’s Bring Your Own Bag law came into force on New Year’s Day.

Shoppers in the Maryland county are now charged 10 cents per paper bag.

Grocery stores are no longer providing plastic bags to shoppers at the checkout.

Shoppers are encouraged to use reusable bags.

But, there are a limited set of circumstances where plastic bags will still be provided.

Plastic bags will be provided to shoppers who are buying meat and seafood products.

Some customers will not have to pay the 10-cent tax.

This applies to shoppers who receive SNAP benefits.

More than 41 million people across the US receive SNAP benefits, known as food stamps.

Single-use plastic bags are no longer available at stores across California.

Shoppers must either bring reusable bags or have to pay 10 cents for a paper carrier.

Officials in some Californian counties such as Napa warned retailers who ignored the ban risked hefty penalties.

Fines could start at $1,000 per day, capping at $5,000.

Officials in at least 12 states have rolled out some restrictions on plastic bags.

New York’s plastic bag ban has been in place since March 2020.

The rest of the top five remained unchanged, with China Life Insurance (Group) Co., Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. of China Ltd., and Prudential Financial Inc. ranking third through fifth.

AM Best compiled the rankings using BestLink data and additional research, published in the January 2026 issue of Best’s Review. Analysts said Berkshire Hathaway’s rise in asset rankings reflects the growing scale and diversification of large multinational insurers, which may increase competitive pressure on smaller or regional carriers.

UnitedHealth’s continued dominance in premiums highlights the ongoing concentration of the US health insurance market, which could influence pricing and product strategies globally.

The company’s ambitions now span factories, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and nearly any domain that can be trained, tested, or perfected in simulation before ever touching the real world.
Nvidia’s real obsession is physical AI The biggest buzzword of the night was “physical AI,” Nvidia’s term for AI systems that don’t just generate content but actually act.
Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.
GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale.","It’s hard to say whether Nvidia has ever truly been subtle with its announcements. At last year’s CES, CEO and founder Jensen Huang stunned the industry with the debut of the GeForce RTX 50 series alongside Nvidia Cosmos, its ambitious world-model initiative. This year’s show was more restrained on the consumer GPU front, but the message to CES 2026 attendees was still unmistakable: Nvidia wants it all.

""All"" isn't hyperbole. Nvidia is now the first company ever to surpass a $5 trillion valuation — an almost inconceivable figure — and Huang and company show no signs of slowing down. The company’s ambitions now span factories, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and nearly any domain that can be trained, tested, or perfected in simulation before ever touching the real world. If something can be modeled, Nvidia wants to power it.

Nvidia’s real obsession is physical AI

The biggest buzzword of the night was “physical AI,” Nvidia’s term for AI systems that don’t just generate content but actually act. These models are trained in virtual environments using synthetic data, then deployed into physical machines once they’ve learned how the world works.

Huang showcased Cosmos, a world foundation model capable of simulating environments and predicting movement, alongside Alpamayo, a reasoning model specifically designed for autonomous driving. This is the tech Nvidia says will power robots, industrial automation, and self-driving vehicles, as demonstrated by the Mercedes-Benz CLA, which was shown running AI-defined driving on stage. The company also revealed plans to test its own robotaxi service with a partner as soon as 2027, using Level 4 autonomous vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in limited regions.

Nvidia hasn’t announced where the service will launch or with whom it’s partnering, but the move signals a shift from being a behind-the-scenes supplier to actively participating in the self-driving race. Huang has already described robotics — including autonomous vehicles — as Nvidia’s second-most important growth category after AI itself.

No New GPUs

If you were waiting for new consumer GPUs, you probably noticed very quickly that there weren’t any. Nvidia didn’t announce a single new GeForce card, and that felt entirely intentional. Instead, Huang spent most of the keynote talking about Rubin, Nvidia’s next-generation AI platform that’s already in full production.

Rubin is described as more than just a chip, but an entire system. GPUs, CPUs, networking, and storage, all designed together to handle the immense (and environment-altering) compute demands of modern AI models at data center scale. Nvidia framed this as essential to keeping up with skyrocketing AI demand, where training costs, energy use, and bottlenecks are becoming existential problems.

The absence of gaming hardware shouldn't be considered a snub, but it is clear that Nvidia is no longer driven by gamers. It's kind of been clear that's been the case for a while, but today's conference really drove the nail in the coffin. Instead, the company's ambitions are driven by hyperscalers, governments, and anyone trying to automate everything that moves.

'Open' AI, powered by Nvidia hardware

The third major takeaway was Nvidia’s ongoing push to make itself unavoidable through openness — or at least Nvidia’s version of it. Huang repeatedly emphasized that the company isn’t just selling hardware, but open AI models that developers can actually use, fine-tune, and deploy (not to be confused with ChatGPT developer OpenAI). Nvidia now has open models spanning healthcare, climate science, robotics, embodied intelligence, reasoning AI, and autonomous driving, all trained on Nvidia supercomputers and released as foundational building blocks. They've practically become the corn of tech.

Even personal AI agents got some stage time, with demos of local agents running on Nvidia’s DGX Spark hardware. Nvidia aims to be the platform beneath every AI system, from massive data centers to individual desktops. It’s an elegant strategy — sell openness, but still own the pipes.

Taken together, the keynote felt like a declaration. Nvidia isn’t chasing CES hype cycles any more. It’s positioning itself as the backbone of an AI-powered world, where the most important announcements don’t happen on stage, and the most impactful products aren’t meant to fit under your desk.",https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/06Xo82tWDIYCfuZRGSYuhmu/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1767660808.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:01:04.830607

ID20,HP Inc,2026-01-06 03:37:11+00:00,www.theregister.com,HP pushes PC-in-a-keyboard for businesses with hot desks - The Register,Avram Piltch,,,,,https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/06/hp_keyboard_pc/,"This could theoretically work in businesses that practice hoteling and expect employees to carry their keyboard to whatever hot desk they are using today.
HP updates its commercial laptop lineup with EliteBook X G2 Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP's new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops.
The EliteBook X G2i features Intel's upcoming ""Panther Lake,"" Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.
You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice).
In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity.","At most businesses today, the IT department gives laptops out to employees so they can easily take their work with them. But HP has a different idea: build a Windows computer into a full-size keyboard and let you carry that around, plugging into monitors and mice along the way.

Announced on Monday at CES 2026, the HP EliteBoard G1a looks like a standard desktop keyboard, complete with 93 keys, including a number pad. Its keys have a solid 2 mm of travel, more than most laptops, and felt OK to type on during our brief hands-on, but it's not mechanical so isn't the best keyboard money can buy. However, look at the back surface and you'll notice a small vent where air comes out and either two USB-C ports, or, on some SKus, a single port with a built-in USB-C cable that hangs off it like a tail.

The idea is that you plug the EliteBoard G1a into a monitor that has USB-C video input and allow it to send data and get power over a single wire. Connect a wireless mouse and you've got your workstation covered. Maintain a similar monitor and mouse setup at home and you can carry just the keyboard back and forth.

If your monitor, like the majority on the market, doesn't have a USB-C input, you can use an included USB-to-HDMI adapter to connect. You can use a 65 W USB-C power adapter to juice the G1a if it's not getting electricity directly from the monitor.

The G1a weighs between 1.49 and 1.69 pounds, depending on config, and measures 14.1 in x 4.7 in x 0.7 inches, so it is more portable than most laptops, though it is longer and thicker than some. At its CES preview, HP showed off a long, thin envelope you can use to carry it and said it would also fit into any laptop bag that holds a 16-inch or larger laptop.

The G1a comes powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 or 7 (330, 340, or 350 Pro) with integrated AMD Radeon 800 graphics and an NPU that runs at up to 50 TOPS (Trillion Operations Per Second). Those specs make it a Copilot+ PC by Microsoft's standards, which means you get certain offline AI features like Microsoft Recall, Click to Do, and Windows Studio Effects. You can get it with up to 64 GB of DDR5 5600 MT/s RAM and up to 2 TB of SSD storage, along with Wi-Fi 6E or 7 connectivity.

When it comes out in March, the G1a will be available either with or without an embedded cable. It's unclear what the price difference will be, but having an embedded cable is a disadvantage because it makes the keyboard harder to carry safely and easier to break.

You'll also be able to configure the G1a with or without a 32 Wh battery that HP claims can offer up to 3.5 hours of unplugged use or two days in sleep. It's difficult to imagine a scenario where you'd need to use the keyboard without a power source, but having it be asleep while you carry it from one destination to another would be a huge plus.

HP is marketing the EliteBoard G1a as an enterprise device, which means enterprise-grade security. The keyboard PC will have HP Wolf Security for Business, which protects the BIOS from firmware attacks.

By building the PC into a keyboard and selling the G1a based on portability, HP hopes to change business behavior from laptop culture to keyboard culture. This could theoretically work in businesses that practice hoteling and expect employees to carry their keyboard to whatever hot desk they are using today.

However, asking employees to have a similar monitor and mouse setup at home seems like an additional hassle that IT departments won't want and, if the business has to pay for this home monitor, the cost of this solution and the support needed become more of a hassle. We don't know how much the G1a will cost either. To justify itself, it would have to cost significantly less than a business laptop.

Where we could see the G1a taking off is in call centers or other environments where desk space is tight. In lieu of buying an all-in-one PC, companies could buy HP's keyboard computer and stick it on the desk for various employees to use as they come on and off shift. But taking it back and forth between locations seems like a rare use case.

HP updates its commercial laptop lineup with EliteBook X G2

Those looking for a more traditional portable computer will find options in HP's new lineup of EliteBook X G2 laptops. These 14-inch laptops are available with a choice of three different processor platforms from each of the three PC CPU manufacturers. The EliteBook X G2i features Intel's upcoming ""Panther Lake,"" Core Ultra 5, and Ultra 7 series processors, while the EliteBook X G2q (Q for Qualcomm) is powered by Snapdragon X2 Elite or X Plus processors, and the EliteBook X G2a (A for AMD) runs AMD Ryzen AI 5, 7, or 9 chips.

The 14-inch laptop weighs around 2.4 pounds (1.09 kg) in most configurations, but there's also an Intel-powered G2i lightweight config that starts at 2.2 pounds (998 g) and a bend-back 2-in-1 called the EliteBook X Flip G2i that tips the scales at 2.86 pounds (1.29 kg). Depending on config, you can get it with a variety of screen panel options, ranging from a 1920 x 1200, 300-nit panel on the low end to a 2880 x 1800 OLED touch screen that goes up to 700 nits and 120 Hz.

The EliteBook X G2 series laptops are available with up to a 2 TB PCIe SSD and as much as 64 GB of LPDDR5x RAM. They sport a 5 MP webcam that has an IR sensor for facial recognition and can do human presence detection to tell if you're at your seat.

You can power the EliteBook X G2 with an included 65 W or 100 W power adapter (your choice). There's a built-in three-cell, 56 Wh or six-cell, 68 Wh battery.

All versions of the laptop come with Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, Bluetooth 6, and the option of adding a 5G modem. In the case of the EliteBook X G2q, the modem comes from Qualcomm, while the AMD and Intel versions have HP R15 or R18 5G connectivity. The lightweight G2i model is Wi-Fi only.

If your company has a Microsoft 365 Copilot account and you own or plan to buy an HP Enterprise printer that works with its ecosystem of Workpath apps, you'll soon be able to get that AI directly in your print/scan solution.

Dubbed HP for Microsoft 365 Copilot and due out this spring, the new on-printer software lets you do new AI-related kinds of things directly from the printer/scanner's touch screen. First, you'll be able to redact personally identifiable information from documents before you print them. Imagine scanning in a resume or opening it up from OneDrive and having the name and other information blacked out so that hiring managers can only look at the qualifications.

You'll also be able to have Copilot suggest file names for documents you scan so that you can easily identify them when looking through your folders. As you might expect, Copilot will also print AI-generated summaries of documents in lieu of the documents themselves and will do translation on-device. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2026/01/02/hp0.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:33.675139

“Full ownership of PA Consulting will further strengthen Jacobs’ capabilities in advisory, digital and transformation services,” the company said, describing the deal as aligned with its long-term strategy to support clients across the full lifecycle of major programs.

Additional details disclosed in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show the acquisition is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings within the first 12 months following closing. Jacobs said it plans to fund the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. Upon closing, PA Consulting will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Jacobs.

According to the filing, the transaction implies an enterprise value of approximately $4.0 billion (£3.05 billion) for PA Consulting, based on closing assumptions and expected adjustments. The filing also discloses about $99 million (£75 million) in deferred consideration, payable two years after closing and tied to Jacobs’ share performance, a structure that keeps PA Consulting’s stakeholders economically aligned with Jacobs’ long-term operating results.

Jacobs said the transaction will require national security approvals in the United Kingdom and Denmark, reflecting PA Consulting’s involvement in government, defense and other sensitive infrastructure-related advisory work.

In a Jan. 5 research note, Baird Equity Research said the transaction values PA Consulting at roughly 13 times adjusted EBITDA, declining to about 12.3 times when anticipated cost synergies are included. The analyst said the deal’s incremental earnings impact will appear modest due to accounting treatment, noting that Jacobs had already been consolidating most of PA Consulting’s results prior to full ownership.

Full ownership would have modestly lifted Jacobs’ adjusted margin—by about 60 basis points—based on fiscal 2025 results, reflecting the higher-margin profile of advisory work, the note said.

Now, it's just another opportunity for Nvidia to peddle its AI hardware and software — in particular its next-gen Vera Rubin architecture.

The AI arms dealer boasts that, compared to Blackwell, the chips will deliver up to 5x higher floating point performance for inference, 3.5x for training, along with 2.8x more memory bandwidth and an NvLink interconnect that's now twice as fast.

But don't get too excited just yet. It's not like the chips are launching earlier than previously expected. They're still expected to arrive in the second half of the year, just like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra did.

Nvidia normally holds off until GTC in March to reveal its next-gen chips. Perhaps AMD's aggressive rack scale roadmap has Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang nervous. Announced at Advancing AI late last spring and expected later this year, AMD's double-wide Helios racks promise to deliver performance on par with Vera Rubin NVL72 while offering customers 50 percent more HBM4.

Nvidia has also been teasing the Vera Rubin platform for nearly a year now, to the point where there's not much we didn't already know about the platform.

But even though you won't be able to get your hands on Rubin for a few more months, it's never too early for a closer look at what the multi-million dollar machines will buy you.

NVL72 refined

The flagship system for Nvidia's Vera Rubin CPU and GPU architectures is once again its NVL72 rack systems. At first blush, the machine doesn't look all that different from its Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra-based siblings. But under the hood, Nvidia has been hard at work refining the architecture for better serviceability and telemetry.

Switch trays can now be serviced without taking down the machine first. Nvidia also has new reliability, availability, and serviceability features which enable customers to check in on the health of the GPUs without dropping them from the cluster first. These health checks can now run between training checkpoints or jobs, Ian Buck, Nvidia's VP and General Manager of Hyperscale and HPC, tells El Reg.

At the heart of the rack is the Vera Rubin superchip, which, if history tells us anything, should bear the VR200 code name.

Much like Blackwell, the Vera Rubin superchip features two dual-die Rubin GPUs, each capable of churning out 50 petaFLOPS of inference performance or 35 petaFLOPS for training. Both of those numbers refer to peak performance achievable when using NVLFP4 data type.

According to Buck, for this generation, Nvidia is using a new adaptive compression technique that's better suited to generative AI and mixture of experts (MoE) model inference to achieve the 50 petaFLOP claim rather than structured sparsity. As you may recall, while structured sparsity did have benefits for certain workloads, it didn't offer many if any advantages for LLM inference.

Of course, higher-precision data types remain relevant for many workloads, whether for vision-language model inference, image generation, fine-tuning, training, or high-performance computing (HPC). In this respect Nvidia hasn't deprecated support for any data types, but its approach to some like FP64 has changed a little.

FP64 is essential for HPC and scientific computing workloads, such as physics simulations and material analysis, and compared to Blackwell, performance regressed from 45 teraFLOPS to 33 TFLOPS of double-precision vector performance on Rubin. For FP64 matrix applications, which are what the Top500 ranking of the most powerful publicly known supercomputers is heavily weighted toward, performance is achieved using emulation, an approach that was pioneered on Blackwell accelerators.

The GPUs are fed by 288 GB of HBM4 memory — 576 GB per superchip — which, despite delivering the same capacity as the Blackwell Ultra-based GB300, is now 2.8x faster at 22 TB/s per socket (44 TB/s per superchip). If that number seems a little high, that's because Nvidia initially targeted 13 TB/s of HBM4 bandwidth when it first teased Rubin last year. Buck tells us that the jump to 22 TB/s was attained entirely through silicon and doesn't rely on techniques like memory compression.

The two Rubin GPUs are paired to Nvidia's new Vera CPU via a 1.8 TB/s NvLink-C2C interconnect. The CPU contains 88 of Nvidia's custom Arm-based Olympus cores and is paired with 1.5 TB of LPDDR5x memory — 3x that of the GB200. We guess we know why memory is in such short supply these days. Actually it's more complicated than that, but this certainly isn't helping the situation.

However, one of the most important features Vera brings to the table is support for confidential computing across the system's NvLink domain, something that previously was only available on x86-based HGX systems.

Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL72 racks feature 72 Rubin GPUs, 20.7 TB of HBM4, 36 Vera CPUs, 54 TB of LPDDR5x which are spread across 18 compute blades interconnected by nine NvSwitch 6 blades which deliver 3.6 TB/s of bandwidth to each GPU — twice that of last gen.

Nvidia isn't ready to say how much power that additional compute and bandwidth will require. However, Buck tells us that while it will be higher, we shouldn't expect power to double.

Wasn't it supposed to be 144?

If you're scratching your head wondering ""didn't Nvidia say this thing was supposed to have 144 GPUs?"" you wouldn't be the only one. At GTC 2025, Huang announced that they were changing the way they counted GPUs from the package to the dies on board. In that sense, the Blackwell-based NVL72s also had 144 GPUs, but Nvidia was going to wait for Vera Rubin to make the switch to the new convention.

It seems Nvidia has since changed its mind and is sticking with the established naming convention. Having said that, we may yet see Nvidia racks with at least 144 GPUs on board before long.

Then there's CPX

The Rubin CPUs we've talked about up to this point actually are one of two accelerators announced so far. Rubin CPX is the other.

Unveiled in September, the chip is a more niche product, designed specifically to accelerate the compute-intense prefill phase of LLM inference. Since prefill isn't bandwidth-bound, CPX doesn't need HBM and can instead make do with slower DRAM.

Each CPX accelerator will be capable of churning out 30 petaFLOPS of NVFP4 compute and will sport 128 GB of GDDR7 memory.

In a graphic shared this summer, Nvidia showed an NVL144 CPX blade with four 288 GB Rubin SXM modules and eight Rubin CPX prefill accelerators for a total of 12 GPUs per node.

The complete rack system would only need 12 compute blades for the thing to have 144 GPUs, though only 48 of them would be connected via NVLink.

Stitching together a SuperPOD

As with past Nvidia rack systems, eight NVL72 racks form a SuperPOD with the GPU slinger's Spectrum-X Ethernet and/or Quantum-X InfiniBand the glue used to stitch them together. Multiple SuperPODS can then be combined to form larger compute environments for training or distributed inference.

If you aren't ready to make the switch to Nvidia's rack-scale kit, don't worry. Eight-way (NVL8) HGX systems based around the Rubin platform are still available, but we're told liquid cooling is no longer a suggestion, but a requirement. These smaller systems, 64 to be exact, can also be combined to form a SuperPOD with 512 GPUs — just shy of the of the more powerful NVL72 SuperPOD at 576.

For this generation, Nvidia also has two new NICs, which it teased on a few occasions over the last year. At GTC DC, Nvidia showed off the ConnectX-9, a 1.6 Tbps ""superNIC"" designed for high-speed distributed computing, which we sometimes call the backend network.

For storage, management, and security, Nvidia is pushing its BlueField-4 data processing units (DPUs), which feature an integrated 800 Gbps ConnectX-9 NIC and a 64-core Grace CPU on board. This, we should note, isn't the same Grace CPU found in the GB200, but a newer version based on Arm's Neoverse V3 core architecture.

The beefier CPU is designed to offload software defined networking, storage, security, and can also run hypervisors for virtualized environments.

Playing Whac-A-Mole with inference bottlenecks

Cramming 64 Grace cores onto a NIC might seem like overkill, but Nvidia has a specific reason for wanting that much compute hanging off the machine like a computer in front of a computer.

Alongside all its shiny new hardware, Nvidia showed off what it's describing as a ""new class of memory between the GPU and storage,"" designed to offload key value (KV) caches.

The basic idea isn't new. KV caches store the model's state. You can think of this like its short-term memory. Calculating the key value vectors is one of the more compute-intensive aspects of the inference.

Because inference workloads often involve passing over the same info multiple times, it makes sense to cache the computed vectors in memory. By doing this, only changes need to be computed and data in the cache can be reused. This sounds simple, but, in practice, KV caches can be quite large, easily consuming tens of gigabytes in order to keep track of 100,000 or so tokens. That might sound like a lot, but a single user running a code assistant or agent can blow through that rather quickly.

As we understand it, Nvidia's Inference Context Storage platform will work with storage platforms from multiple partner vendors, and will take advantage of the BlueField-4 DPU, NIXL GPU direct storage libraries, and optimize KV cache offloading for maximum performance and efficiency.

Combined with technologies like Rubin CPX, this kind of high-performance KV offloading should allow the GPUs to spend more time generating tokens and less time waiting on data to be shuffled about and recomputed.

The AI infrastructure arena heats up

Nvidia's decision to ""launch"" Rubin — again it isn't actually shipping in volume yet — betrays an increasingly competitive compute landscape.

As we mentioned earlier, AMD's Helios rack systems promise to deliver floating point performance roughly equivalent to Nvidia's Vera Rubin NVL72 at 2.9 exaFLOPS versus 2.5-3.6 exaFLOPS of FP4, respectively. For applications that can't take advantage of Nvidia's adaptive compression tech, Helios is, at least on paper, faster.

However, with Nvidia planning to ship faster memory on Rubin than initially planned, AMD no longer has a bandwidth advantage. It does still have a capacity lead with 432 GB of HBM4 per GPU socket compared to 288 GB on Rubin. In theory, this should allow the AMD-based system to serve 50 percent larger MoE models on a single double-wide rack.

In practice, the real-world performance is going to depend heavily on how well tunneling Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink) over Broadcom's Tomahawk 6 Ethernet switches actually works.

AMD's MI450-series GPUs appear very well positioned to compete against Rubin, but as we've seen repeated with Amazon and Google, the ability to scale that compute often makes a bigger difference than the chip's individual performance.

AMD is also having to play catch up on the software ecosystem front. The company's HIP and ROCm libraries have certainly come a long way since the MI300X made its debut at the end of 2023, but the company still has a ways to go.

LLMs, robots, and autonomous cars

Nvidia certainly isn't making the situation any easier for AMD. At CES, the GPU giant unveiled a slew of new software frameworks aimed at enterprises, robotics devs, and the automotive industry.

This includes the development of new foundation models for domain specific applications like retrieval augmented generation, safety, speech, and autonomous driving.

The latter, called Alpamayo, is a relatively small ""reasoning vision language action"" model designed to help level-4 autonomous vehicles better handle unique and fast evolving road conditions. Level-4 capable vehicles are capable of driving fully autonomously, unsupervised driving in specific environments, like high-ways or urban environments.

Nvidia's autonomous driving stack is due to hit US roads late this year with the level-2++ capable Mercedes Benz CLA. This class of autonomous vehicle is capable of driving itself in similar conditions as level-4, but requires the supervision of a human operator.

What about GTC?

With Nvidia kicking off the New Year with Rubin — a chip we hadn't expected to get a good look at for another three months — we're left to wonder what we'll see at GTC, which is slated to run from March 16-19 in San Jose, California.

In addition to the regular mix of software libraries and foundation models, we expect to get a lot more details on the Kyber racks that'll underpin the company's Vera Rubin Ultra platform starting in 2027.

As you might have noticed, Nvidia, AMD, AWS, and others have gotten in the habit of pre-announcing products well in advance of them shipping or becoming generally available. As the saying goes: enterprises don't buy products, they buy roadmaps. In this case, however, it's really about ensuring they have somewhere to put them.

Nvidia's Kyber racks are expected to pull 600 kilowatts of power which means datacenter operators need to start preparing now, if they want to deploy them on day one.

We don't yet have a full picture of what Vera Rubin Ultra will offer, but we know it'll feature four reticle-sized Rubin Ultra GPUs, 1TB of HBM4e, and will deliver 100 petaFLOPS of FP4 performance.

As things currently stand, Nvidia plans to cram 144 of these GPU packages (576 GPU dies) into a single NvLink domain which is expected to deliver 15 exaFLOPS of FP4 inference performance or 10 exaFLOPS for training. ®",https://regmedia.co.uk/2025/03/18/nvidia_blackwell_ultra_cover.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 23:01:05.425070

Johnson believes that the offense is close to reverting to the unit that helped the Bears average 27.8 points in the six games that preceded their loss to the Lions.

""We're not far away; you never are in this league,"" Johnson said. ""You're really close and so we've just got to clean up some of the mental errors we had.

Private sector firms in Hong Kong raised their output levels for the fifth month in a row in December. Despite easing from the previous survey period, the rate of growth was solid and among the steepest seen over the past three years. Anecdotal evidence suggested that a sustained improvement in demand conditions had driven the latest increase output.

Companies indicated that overall new continued to expand at the end of 2025. The rate of growth broadly matched the solid increase seen for output and was the second strongest since April 2023.

See our latest analysis for International Business Machines.

Over the past year, International Business Machines has seen short term share price pressure, with a 7 day share price return of 4.66% and 30 day share price return of 5.34%, alongside a much stronger 1 year total shareholder return of 34.29%. This suggests earlier momentum has cooled recently, even as long term holders have still done well.

If IBM’s recent moves have you thinking about where else capital could work hard in tech and AI, it may be worth scanning high growth tech and AI stocks as a next step.

So with IBM’s recent short term pullback sitting against strong multi year total returns and annual revenue and net income growth, is the stock quietly offering value today, or is the market already pricing in its future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 1% Undervalued

With International Business Machines last closing at US$291.50 and the most followed narrative pointing to fair value around US$293.89, the gap is small but meaningful for investors weighing upside against execution risk.

The analysts are assuming International Business Machines's revenue will grow by 5.1% annually over the next 3 years. The launch of the z17 mainframe with enhanced AI acceleration and energy efficiency is anticipated to drive significant customer adoption, positively impacting infrastructure revenue and possibly net margins due to differentiation and pricing power.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what kind of earnings profile and margin mix sits behind that near inline fair value? The narrative leans heavily on steady top line gains, thicker profitability and a future earnings multiple more commonly associated with higher growth IT names. Are you interested in how those moving parts connect across revenue, margins and valuation assumptions?

Result: Fair Value of $293.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, there are still pressure points to watch, especially any slowdown in IBM’s consumption-based software services or weaker consulting demand if clients delay discretionary projects.

Find out about the key risks to this International Business Machines narrative.

Another View: What Our DCF Model Says

Our SWS DCF model presents a different perspective, with IBM at US$291.50 compared to an estimated fair value of US$279.53. On this view the shares appear overvalued, which suggests less room for error if growth or margins fall short. Which story do you think is closer to reality?

Look into how the SWS DCF model arrives at its fair value.

L'Oréal (ENXTPA:OR) has drawn attention after a period where the share price has slipped over the month and past 3 months, despite a positive 1 year total return and measured multi year gains.

The recent 1-month share price decline of 2.54% and 3-month share price decline of 4.21% contrast with a 1-year total shareholder return of 9.43%. This suggests that shorter-term momentum has faded, while longer-term holders have still seen gains.

With the share price easing in recent months, and current estimates implying some upside to around €388.60, the key question is whether L'Oréal still trades below its intrinsic value or if the market already reflects its future growth potential.

Most Popular Narrative: 6.3% Undervalued

Compared with the last close at €363.30, the most followed narrative points to a higher fair value based on future earnings power and cash flows.

Major capital allocation to acquisitions and digital or AI-driven innovation is expected to increase category leadership, fuel product differentiation, and raise future revenue and net margins.

Curious what kind of revenue, margin and valuation mix could justify that higher value on a beauty giant? The full narrative lays out a detailed earnings path, profit profile and future P/E that need to line up before that target makes sense.

Result: Fair Value of €387.55 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this hinges on L'Oréal staying ahead of fast moving local and digital first rivals, and avoiding margin pressure if advertising and promotional spending keeps climbing.

Another angle on valuation

While the narrative points to L'Oréal being 6.3% undervalued, the current P/E of 31.6x tells a tighter story. It is slightly above its own fair ratio of 31x and above both peer averages at 29.3x and the wider European personal products group at 21.1x. That premium suggests the market already prices in a lot of quality, so the question is how much extra you are willing to pay for it.

The company that runs the once-vibrant Westfield mall filed unlawful detainer complaints Friday in San Francisco Superior Court to kick out a restaurant, an eyebrow salon, and a shoe repair shop.

On Monday, a sign just inside the mall’s Fifth Street entrance still listed dozens of shuttered businesses as if they were still open for business. There was barely anyone shopping at the dwindling shops, such as H&M and shoe store Ecco, which offered steep markdowns for pre-closure sales.

The court filings, in three cases, target the owners and operators of Shoe Wiz, on the mall’s concourse, the Executive Order Bar & Lounge, and Eyebrow Plus beauty chain. None responded to requests for comment Monday.

Since it was foreclosed on in November, the mall has been controlled by a Delaware-based entity that represents the lender. An attorney for the mall, Gregory P. Barbee, did not respond to requests for comment.

The San Francisco Centre, which once housed Nordstrom and a flagship Bloomingdale’s, has struggled since the pandemic. The lender-controlled entity has been working to either restructure the asset or prepare it for sale or redevelopment.

According to a complaint filed against the CEO of beauty chain Eyebrow Plus, the store was given a three-day notice to leave on Dec. 13. The filing, which notes that the store remained open Dec. 18, seeks damages of $201.37 “for each day Defendant continues in possession of the Premises and through the time of judgment,” plus a declaration of forfeiture and recovery of suit costs. Shoe Wiz, steps away from the mall’s still busy Panda Express restaurant, was locked; boxes and shelves of merchandise could be seen.

At Eyebrow Plus, a lone employee who declined to share her name stood ready to handle any walk-in customers. She said the business was set to close by Jan. 31.",https://assets.sfstandard.com/image/994911177489/image_tihmcnrmm975t61t39rqr3k208/-FWEBP,N,,2026-01-05 21:01:19.079677

Alpha Mayo does something that's really special.

Not only does it take sensor input and activates steering wheel, brakes and and acceleration, it also reasons about what action it is about to take.

It tells you what action it's going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action, and then of course, the trajectory.

Sydney, Jan 6, 2026 AEST (ABN Newswire) - Locksley Resources Limited (ASX:LKY) (X5L:FRA) (LKYRF:OTCMKTS) advised that recent reconnaissance and surface sampling programs have successfully identified a consistent northwest to southeast oriented mineralised corridor at the Mojave Project.

HIGHLIGHTS

- Results from rock chip sampling returns 409g/t Ag confirming high-grade silver mineralisation ~3km from the initial high-grade silver discovery (Sample 258140), 320m southwest of the Desert Antimony Mine (DAM)

- Significant base metal mineralisation confirmed in addition to silver, with samples returning grades up to 4.2% Copper (Cu), 1.5% Lead (Pb), and 1.5% Zinc (Zn), highlighting the polymetallic nature of the system

- Twelve (12) rock chip samples exceeded 30g/t Ag, reinforcing additional precious and base metal potential within the Mojave Project's North Block

- This discovery represents an important advancement in the Company's exploration strategy and identifies a new, potentially high-value component of the Mojave Project

This discovery represents an important advancement in the Company's exploration strategy and identifies a new, potentially high-value component of the Mojave Project. The delineation of a mineralised corridor suggests a strike extent approximately 2.4km westnorthwest of the Hendricks Shaft, and approximately 600m to the east-southeast, extending the mineralised corridor almost 3km from the Silver Prospect. This confirms the presence of a polymetallic quartz vein system, which includes the high-grade sample 258140 collected from a 3cm to 10cm wide vein (Figure 1*). These early results possibly suggest that the Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu mineralisation may reflect the presence of a large-scale hydrothermal system, which could potentially contain valuable concentrations of precious and base metals. Further exploration is required to test this concept.

Rock chip sampling within the Mojave Project's North Block has returned results of up to 409g/t Ag, with associated base metal values of up to 1.5% Zn and 0.88% Pb, supporting the interpretation of a polymetallic mineralised system and enhancing the prospectivity of the corridor. Additional rock chip sample 258420 returned values up to 117g/t Ag, & 3.1% Cu, also located within the interpreted mineralised corridor located close to a historic adit and workings.

The interpreted mineralised corridor includes the historic Hendricks Shaft, located approximately 2.4km from the initial high-grade silver discovery. A total of 398 rock chip samples have been collected across the North Block with ~260 of these being collected along the mineralised corridor between DAM and up to 5.6km to the southeast.

Rock Chip Sampling Program Details

The recent sampling campaign was designed to test the strike extent of the high-grade silver mineralisation first identified in late 2024. The results (see Table 1) have exceededexpectations, confirming that the mineralised system extends significantly beyond the initial discovery zone (Sample 258140 - Figure 1*).

Key observations from the program include:

- Strike Extension: The mineralised corridor is now interpreted to extend from the Silver Prospect (Sample 258140) to historical trenches and stockpiles (Samples 258184 & 258185) located ~3km to the south-east significantly increasing the strike extent of the exploration target.

- Mineralisation Style: High-grade samples 258184 and 258185, collected from outcropping veins and historic stockpiles, exhibit quartz with gossanous selvages with boxwork textures. These are potential indicators of weathered sulphide-rich polymetallic veins, suggesting fresh sulphides may exist at depth.

- Visual Copper: Sample 258420 (which returned 117g/t Ag & 3.1% Cu) was collected from outcropping mineralisation at historic workings where copper carbonate (i.e. malachite) is visually prevalent (see Figure 3*). This confirms a copper component to the mineralised system.

Next Steps

Locksley will advance this exciting silver and base metal opportunity through a systematic exploration program run in parallel with ongoing activities at DAM and El Campo, comprising:

- Systematic Mapping: Detailed geological mapping between the Silver Prospect and the new south-eastern extension to define the structural geometry and continuity of the trend.

- Petrology and Geochemistry: Submission of samples for petrological interpretation to assist with determining relative timing of mineralisation and geochemical associations across the system.

- Geophysics: Assessment of geophysical survey options, such as Very Low Frequency electromagnetics (VLF-EM), Induced Polarisation (IP), or Electromagnetic (e.g. VTEM) to potentially identify mineralised zones and structures at depth that are not visible at surface.

- Drill Targeting: The goal of this work is to delineate high-priority drill-ready targets along the NW-SE corridor for future testing.

Additional work is planned to improve understanding of the corridor's structural geometry, enabling more effective drill targeting and delineation of the extent and grade of mineralisation within the North Block.

Kerrie Matthews, Managing Director & CEO, commented:

""Defining a 3km mineralised trend with surface results of up to 409 g/t silver and 1.5% copper is a highly encouraging outcome. Importantly, this discovery complements our core antimony development strategy and gives exposure as a diversified U.S. critical minerals company, providing shareholders with upside to precious metals, base metals, and strategic minerals within a single, high-quality project area.""

About Locksley Resources Limited

Locksley Resources Limited (ASX:LKY) (FRA:X5L) (OTCMKTS:LKYRF) is an ASX listed explorer focused on critical minerals in the United States of America. The Company is actively advancing exploration across two key assets: the Mojave Project in California, targeting rare earth elements (REEs) and antimony. Locksley Resources aims to generate shareholder value through strategic exploration, discovery and development in this highly prospective mineral region.

Mojave Project

Located in the Mojave Desert, California, the Mojave Project comprises over 250 claims across two contiguous prospect areas, namely, the North Block/Northeast Block and the El Campo Prospect. The North Block directly abuts claims held by MP Materials, while El Campo lies along strike of the Mountain Pass Mine and is enveloped by MP Materials' claims, highlighting the strong geological continuity and exploration potential of the project area.

In addition to rare earths, the Mojave Project hosts the historic ""Desert Antimony Mine"", which last operated in 1937. Despite the United States currently having no domestic antimony production, demand for the metal remains high due to its essential role in defense systems, semiconductors, and metal alloys. With significant surface sample results, the Desert Mine prospect represents one of the highest-grade known antimony occurrences in the U.S.

Locksley's North American position is further strengthened by rising geopolitical urgency to diversify supply chains away from China, the global leader in both REE & antimony production. With its maiden drilling program planned, the Mojave Project is uniquely positioned to align with U.S. strategic objectives around critical mineral independence and economic security.

Tottenham Project

Locksley's Australian portfolio comprises the advanced Tottenham Copper-Gold Project in New South Wales, focused on VMS-style mineralisation in a well established mining region.

Locksley is committed to delivering value through discovery, development, and strategic partnerships, with a focus on securing access to U.S. aligned funding and downstream collaborations.

Demand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat.
It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.","Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making giant Nvidia, put his company at the forefront of the artificial intelligence boom by making semiconductors more powerful than any of his rivals’. This year, he’s promising to do it again.

On Monday, Mr. Huang said the company would begin shipping a new A.I. chip later this year, one that can do more computing with less power than previous generations of chips could. Known as the Vera Rubin, the chip has been in development for three years and is designed to fulfill A.I. requests more quickly and cheaply than its predecessors.

Mr. Huang, who spoke during CES, an annual tech conference in Las Vegas, also discussed Nvidia’s surprisingly ambitious work around autonomous vehicles. This year, Mercedes-Benz will begin shipping cars equipped with Nvidia self-driving technology comparable to Tesla’s Autopilot.

Nvidia’s new Rubin chips are being manufactured and will be shipped to customers, including Microsoft and Amazon, in the second half of the year, fulfilling a promise Mr. Huang made last March when he first described the chip at the company’s annual conference in San Jose, Calif.

Companies will be able to train A.I. models with one-quarter as many Rubin chips as its predecessor, the Blackwell. It can provide information for chatbots and other A.I. products for one-tenth of the cost. They will also be able to install the chips in data centers more quickly, courtesy of redesigned supercomputers that feature fewer cables.

If the new chips live up to their promise, they could allow companies to develop A.I. at a lower cost and at least begin to respond to the soaring electrical demands of data centers being built around the world.

“This is how we’re going to get everybody to the next frontier and push A.I. to the next level and, of course, to build these data centers energy efficiently and cost efficiently as well,” Mr. Huang said.

The Rubin chips are named for the astronomer Vera Rubin, who did groundbreaking research on dark matter. The new chips are key to maintaining Nvidia’s dominance of the A.I. industry and its perch as the world’s most valuable company. Nvidia’s A.I. chips, which account for more than 90 percent of the market, are highly coveted by businesses and governments around the world. It sells them for about $30,000 each, with nearly three-quarters of that being pure profit.

The rising threat contributed to Nvidia’s deal last month to license technology from the chip start-up Groq. The agreement is expected to help Nvidia develop chips that allow A.I. to more efficiently fulfill requests through a process known as inference.

Because more people are using A.I., chip makers are trying to make delivering it less expensive and less power hungry, said Daniel Newman, the chief executive of Futurum Group, a tech research firm. “That’s the name of the game because utilization is very early,” he said.

The competitive challenges have buffeted Nvidia alongside a series of geopolitical headaches. Mr. Huang spent much of last year lobbying President Trump to allow Nvidia to sell its A.I. chips to China. At the same time, he was trying to fend off efforts by Beijing to discourage Chinese companies from buying Nvidia’s chips because of security concerns.

In December, Mr. Trump granted the company permission to sell its second-most-powerful chip to China. But Beijing has not decided whether it will allow its companies to buy Nvidia products.

Demand for Nvidia’s chips has turned Mr. Huang, 62, into a globe-trotting salesman and diplomat. He traveled with Mr. Trump to the Middle East and Britain, where he played a key role in technology deals between nations.

Nvidia’s business has flourished during the A.I. boom of the past three years. In November, the company reported a quarterly profit of $31.9 billion, a 65 percent increase from a year earlier and 245 percent from the year before that. It expects about $500 billion in sales through the end of this year.

Still, Mr. Huang has been eager to diversify Nvidia’s business and expand its roster of customers. He has been pushing the company to become a major player in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

On Monday, he said Nvidia had developed new A.I. software that would allow customers like Uber and Lucid to develop cars that navigate roads autonomously. It will share the system, called Alpamayo, to spread its influence and the appeal of Nvidia’s chip technology.

Since 2020, Nvidia has been working with Mercedes to develop a class of self-driving cars. They will begin shipping an early example of their collaboration when Mercedes CLA cars become available in the first half of the year in Europe and the United States.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/05/multimedia/NVIDIA-Vera-rubin-qjcl/NVIDIA-Vera-rubin-qjcl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 19:01:54.785243

Novo Nordisk on Monday officially launched in the U.S. the pill version of its popular weight loss drug Wegovy. Negotiations with the Trump administration led Novo to price a starter dose at $149 per month for some Medicare beneficiaries and those willing to pay cash. The drug’s website shows that the $149 price will apply to the 1.5 milligram and 4 milligram doses until April 15, after which the higher of the two doses will cost $199. Monthly supplies of a 9 milligram and 25 milligram dose, meanwhile, are priced at $299. People with commercial insurance could pay as little as $25 per month out of pocket, Novo said.

Dutch biotech Argenx will swap CEOs, announcing Monday that leader Tim Van Hauwermeiren will become board chair in May 2026 as part of a planned leadership transition. Once the change is effective, current COO Karen Massey will succeed Van Hauwermeiren and take over what’s in recent years become one of the industry’s most valuable companies thanks to the fast-selling autoimmune drug Vyvgart. Despite the pending CEO switch, Argenx “is in a position of strength” with that drug on track for more than $4 billion in 2025 revenue, “sustainable profitability and a strong balance sheet,” wrote Stifel analyst Alex Thompson.

Sanofi on Dec. 24 agreed to pay $15.50 per share, or about $2.2 billion, to acquire vaccine developer Dynavax Technologies. The deal hands Sanofi a marketed hepatitis B vaccine for adults and a shingles shot that’s currently in early-stage testing. Dynavax’s hepatitis B shot, Hepsilav-B, is administered in two doses over the course of a month, which is supposed to provide higher levels of protection more quickly than other available vaccines. The deal is a “smart strategic move” for Sanofi, giving the company one vaccine with a 46% share of its addressable market and another candidate in the “large and durable” business for shingles shots, wrote Leerink Partners’ David Risinger.

That same day, however, the FDA also rejected Sanofi’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug tolebrutinib. The agency had previously delayed a decision on tolebrutinib, which was being evaluated for non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. And Sanofi had said in mid-December that more guidance would come from the agency sometime in the first quarter of 2026. However, the FDA instead turned back tolebrutinib, which Sanofi research chief Houman Ashrafian referred to in a statement as a “significant and meaningful change in direction” from previous feedback. The rejection represents the latest setback for tolebrutinib, which has failed studies in two other kinds of multiple sclerosis. Jefferies analyst Michael Leuchten also wrote that he expects a “hit to sentiment and questions on management credibility,” given Sanofi’s previous statements about the drug.

He perhaps even learned a thing or two from his friend Sam Altman, who oscillates between his own personal blog and OpenAI's official blog – or even other ones – seemingly on a whim. To that end, Nadella's post isn't a blog on an official Microsoft site or even Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, where many such thought leader-y posts are born, but instead on ""snscratchpad.com"" – there wasn't a better URL available?! That perhaps led it to fly under the radar, with Techmeme just posting it now, even though Nadella posted this a week ago. Maybe this was a new year's resolution to write more, which I can certainly appreciate! We'll see how long he keeps it up... [SN Scratchpad]

📱 OpenAI Latest App Store Attempt – Rolfe Winkler tried to use some of the initial apps in ChatGPT’s latest attempt to re-create the magic of the App Store. The result? Predictably not great. OpenAI says it’s early, which it is, but the real issue is how much easier/better it is to use the partners' services via their actual apps and/or websites. The App Store worked because it took advantage of a new device and form factor in the form of the iPhone. OpenAI’s hope here is to leverage the fact that people already have ChatGPT open, but these other apps really are just a click away, be it in another tab or another app. Which is to say, maybe this strategy works when OpenAI has their own device (if that device is compelling enough), but then again, Amazon has been trying that for years too without much success… I can see some business use cases here, but consumer use cases are going to remain a challenge unless OpenAI can figure out something truly novel (perhaps by using ChatGPT’s knowledge about you?)… [WSJ 🔒]

📽️ Hollywood Had A Slightly Better 2025 – $8.9B in ticket sales (in the US and Canada) was 2% better than 2024 — but such numbers are still down over 20% versus the pre-pandemic levels. And that’s before you take inflation into account. This naturally brings up the ""is this the new normal?"" question, which it probably is unless Hollywood actually does something to change the equation here. Netflix could help, but the industry will do everything in their power to stop that from happening so… Still, one of my predictions for the year is that the 2026 box office will be up pretty significantly, sequentially. And it may even touch those pre-pandemic numbers (again, before inflation). The slate looks that strong with franchises galore (not that those helped much this year). But it will likely be a mirage. Real change — reel change? — remains needed. [NYT]

🥽 Apple Cuts Vision Pro Production & Marketing – Many in Apple's orbit seem to be quick to call this latest report a ""nothingburger"" – mainly in that it's nothing new (IDC's market report notes that Luxshare halted production last year), but I would just note that the company did ship an updated version of the device since then (also IDC's sales estimates do keep falling below even their muted expectations). Sure, it was a small spec upgrade, but many Apple updates are and they still manage to move needles year to year – that does not seem to be the case with Vision Pro. IDC believes they shipped just 45k units in the holiday quarter; Apple sells something like 600k iPhones and about 60k Macs a day. Still, I think that small update was probably the right strategy with the product already in market (they should have launched it as a dev kit, not a full-on consumer product in its current state, but we're way past that now...). Rather than seeing them try to do a lighter/slightly cheaper Vision Pro right now, I'd rather see them meet Meta in the market for Smart Glasses (which is clearly happening). And build up from there. There's just still no real market for headsets yet – Meta dominates it, but even they're seemingly pulling back. [FT 🔒]

📺 Versant Lives! – And more importantly, the now-spun-off new public company sets a potential price for WBD's television assets, which could ultimately make or break the Netflix deal. Right now, Comcast's old TV assets look to be valued by the market somewhere around $6B. At 4.5x forward-earnings, that would make WBD's assets worth... a lot. But it's not that straightforward because those assets are also going to be saddled with... a lot of debt. So at least right now, we're... likely somewhere between what Paramount thinks they are worth and what WBD (and Netflix) thinks they are worth... Funny that. (Don't be shocked if Paramount raises their offer.) [THR]

The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.
Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services.
Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert.
According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops.","Today at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang officially launched the company’s new Rubin computing architecture, which he described as the state of the art in AI hardware. The new architecture is currently in production and is expected to ramp up further in the second half of the year.

“Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing.” Huang told the audience. “Today, I can tell you that Vera Rubin is in full production.”

The Rubin architecture, which was first announced in 2024, is the latest result of Nvidia’s relentless hardware development cycle, which has transformed Nvidia into the most valuable corporation in the world. The Rubin architecture will replace the Blackwell architecture, which in turn, replaced the Hopper and Lovelace architectures.

Rubin chips are already slated for use by nearly every major cloud provider, including high-profile Nvidia partnerships with Anthropic, OpenAI, and Amazon Web Services. Rubin systems will also be used in HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer and the upcoming Doudna supercomputer at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Named for the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.

Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems.

“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”

As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.

Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2219673294.jpg?resize=1200,750",N,,2026-01-05 19:01:58.453381

However, Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets on most of its seats, making it relatively easy to use such devices.
So, are curling irons banned on flights, and does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mention them on its website?","Delta Air Lines has recently been in the news for several reasons. Last week, the airline announced it would soon stop flying to Greater Binghamton Airport (BGM), leaving this facility without carriers. Delta Air Lines has also recently issued an apology after flight 2150 diverted to Atlanta.

Now, the company is once again in the news, but this time it’s because of its passengers. A Delta Air Lines customer was recently filmed while ironing her hair on a flight.

Here is a closer look at what happened, what users have said about the video, and whether this is illegal.

Delta Passenger Caught Using Curling Iron Mid-Flight

On Wednesday, December 31, a TikTok user posted a video that immediately caught the attention of thousands. The footage starts with the creator filming herself, then slightly moving the camera to show the passenger sitting next to her.

The woman is shown calmly curling her hair in mid-flight. The footage also displays the following sentence: “Middle seat curling iron at 30,000 feet is a bold choice.”

The video has already been watched by hundreds of thousands of people, and as of Monday, January 5, it has 176.2k likes and over 3.3k comments. The user who shared the footage also added a caption, tagging Delta and stating, “This feels dangerous.” So, what are TikTok users saying about this hazardous behavior?

Several People Shared Their Shock About The Passenger’s Behavior

The passenger's behavior seems part of a common trend, as people on social media continue to share videos of themselves flying with heatless curl devices to arrive at their final destination with the perfect look. Yet, there’s a massive difference between using heatless curl tools and a curling iron plugged into one of the plane’s outlets.

Plenty of other users commented on the video, sharing their reaction. For instance, a user commented, ""What’s wrong with yall? This is crazy."" Another wrote, ""This is actually insane,"" while many seemed interested in where the passenger plugged in the iron. However, Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets on most of its seats, making it relatively easy to use such devices. Yet, this doesn’t mean curling your hair mid-flight is a wise choice.

Several flight attendants left a comment stating that this is not allowed.

“Flight attendant here, you can't do that. Those outlets aren't meant for things like this,” a TikTok user wrote in a comment.

Some people also left funny comments, such as a user who wrote, “She’s focused on her and you’re focused on her. She is the main character in every life.” Other people pointed out her curling technique, stating that the section of hair was too large.

Unfortunately, these risky behaviors seem to be increasing.

“There was a literal announcement from the pilot on my last flight that the plug ins on planes are for phones only and to not curl straighten or blow dry your hair,” A TikTok user wrote in the comments.

So, are curling irons banned on flights, and does the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mention them on its website?

Are Curling Iron Banned On Planes?

The FAA official website states that cordless curling irons that use a hydrocarbon gas, such as butane, are allowed only in carry-on baggage. However, there is a limit, as each traveler can bring only one of these items.

The website also specifies that a safety cover must be securely fitted over the heating element of cordless curling irons. Furthermore, “The device must be protected from accidental activation.”

However, when it comes to electric curling irons and hair straighteners equipped with cord plugs, like the one shown in the video, there seems to be no restrictions. Yet, this doesn’t mean curling your hair mid-flight is acceptable.

​​​​​​

In this regard, a pilot left a comment under the video, reminding viewers of the fire risk and advising the user filming to call the cabin crew to stop the hazardous behavior.

So, are curling irons banned on planes? It seems that, for now, there is no clear regulation regarding these devices, though this may change soon as more people continue to exhibit dangerous behavior on board.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/passengers-on-a-delta-airlines-flight.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:42.935962

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.55 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

Albertsons (ACI) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:

Revenue: $24.88 billion vs analyst estimates of $24.72 billion (2.5% year-on-year growth, 0.6% beat)

Adjusted EPS: $0.55 vs analyst estimates of $0.54 (in line)

Adjusted EBITDA: $1.11 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.09 billion (4.5% margin, 1.9% beat)

Operating Margin: 1.8%, in line with the same quarter last year

Free Cash Flow Margin: 0.7%, down from 1.7% in the same quarter last year

Locations: 2,264 at quarter end, down from 2,269 in the same quarter last year

Same-Store Sales rose 2.8% year on year (1.4% in the same quarter last year)

Market Capitalization: $9.51 billion

""In the second quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial results while continuing to invest in our core business and elevate the customer experience,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer.

Company Overview

With over 20 well-known grocery banners spanning 34 states, Albertsons ACI operates food and drug retail stores across the US, offering groceries, pharmacy services, and own-brand products under banners like Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.

With $81.01 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Albertsons is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Albertsons to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Albertsons’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish as its store footprint remained unchanged.

This quarter, Albertsons reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products will help support its historical top-line performance.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

A retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.

Albertsons operated 2,264 locations in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.

Albertsons’s demand rose over the last two years and slightly outpaced the industry. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.2% per year. Given its flat store base over the same period, this performance stems from not only increased foot traffic at existing locations but also higher e-commerce sales as demand shifts from in-store to online.

In the latest quarter, Albertsons’s same-store sales rose 2.8% year on year. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.

Key Takeaways from Albertsons’s Q2 Results

It was encouraging to see Albertsons beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $17.25 immediately following the results.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 00:57:51.922872

That’s a wrap for NVIDIA’s CES 2026 presentation.","CES 2026 is here!

Kicking things off for the major chipmakers today is NVIDIA, who is at the show to talk about all things AI – a hot topic across the entire industry at the moment.

NVIDIA CES 2026 Keynote Live Coverage Preview

As with most of NVIDIA’s major presentations, company CEO (and leather jacket enthusiast) Jensen Huang will be headlining NVIDIA’s CES keynote. Also as is usually the case, NVIDIA is being fairly mum about what they will be talking about ahead of the presentation, beyond the fact that it’s all going to be AI-related. And despite being a consumer show, it sounds like the keynote may be limited more towards Enterprise offerings, as NVIDIA’s GeForce group has a separate presentation scheduled for 9pm Pacific this evening. A presentation in which the GeForce group is already setting expectations by stating that there will be no new GPUs announced.

Unlike 2025, where NVIDIA helmed CES’s prime keynote spot, in 2026 they are a bit of an outlier. Officially, the event is not even a keynote open to all attendees, but rather a press conference limited to the media. And it’s not taking place in the Mandalay Bay or Venetian hotels – where most official CES events happen – but rather out at the Fontainebleau hotel. So NVIDIA is a bit off the beaten path this year, running their own press conference at their own hotel. Even the scheduling of the event was relatively late, with NVIDIA not publicly announcing the event until December.

As for what NVIDIA may have up their sleeve this year, NVIDIA’s enterprise hardware schedule calls for 2026 to be the year of Vera Rubin, with that hardware shipping at some point during the year. As well, NVIDIA always has new software to talk about since development of that is largely decoupled from their hardware. But how much they’ll have to say at a more generic venue like CES remains to be seen.

NVIDIA’s keynote kicks off at 1:00pm PST / 4:00pm EST / 21:00 UTC, and according to NVIDIA’s calendar hold, this should be a pretty meaty keynote that runs for about 90 minutes. So please join us in a bit for our live blog coverage of NVIDIA’s CES 2026 keynote.

(And, as always, please excuse any typos stemming from our live coverage)

NVIDIA CES 2025 Keynote Coverage Live

At this point it’s 6 minutes after the hour, and we’re still waiting on NVIDIA to get started. One thing that is in NVIDIA’s favor this year is that since this is not an official CES keynote, they should be able to get right to their presentation without the wrap-around CES/CTA introductions.

Another 6 minutes in and we’re still waiting. For better or worse, we’re not actually in Vegas to cover these keynotes. But it also means I can’t check in with the sportsbook to see what the odds are on NVIDIA starting with another “I am AI” video.

And with that said, here we go!

It looks like we are starting with a montage of GPU rendering and simulation technologies instead. RTX graphics, NVIDIA’s various robotics and physics simulation frameworks, etc.

And here’s Jensen.

3000 people in the auditorium, and another 3000 people in overflow rooms. Not to mention everyone watching the stream.

“Every 15 years the industry resets”

New platforms arise, and new applications get written for those platforms.

This time there are two platform shifts going on. Not just the shift to GPUs, but how applications are even developed. They’re not programmed, they’re trained.

“Computing has been fundamentally reshaped as a result of accelerated computing, as a result of artificial intelligence.”

The modernization of AI is attracting enormous amounts of investment into NVIDIA’s industry.

Jensen is recapping a busy 2025 for NVIDIA – and a larger recap of NVIDIA’s history with AI. As well as the phases of AI models and the rise of reasoning models.

2025 was the year of proliferation for “agentic” models that can do higher level reasoning. NVIDIA is betting big on agentic systems becoming important tools in processing data and providing services.

Finally, 2025 was the year of the proliferation of open models. Which makes AI technology more accessible to everyone.

“This entire industry is going to be reshaped because of that.”

NVIDIA has been making their own investments into open models. Which, in turn, has been what they’ve been using their array of company-owned DGX SuperPOD to train and develop.

“NVIDIA is a frontier AI model builder.” NVIDIA wants to enable every company to be part of the AI revolution.

NVIDIA’s models top the leaderboards in terms of performance and other metrics. All in service of helping NVIDIA’s customers develop AI agents.

Now on to reasoning, and how it is changing the face of AI models. To be able to reason beyond just what it has been explicitly trained on.

Building on top of that is multi-model and multi-modal agents, which can call each other based on their specialization and training.

Now rolling a video showing a short example of building a personal assistant using NVIDIA’s hardware and frameworks.

“The amazing thing is that is utterly trivial now.” But it would have been unimaginable a couple of years ago.

(Jensen has not been having much luck with his presentation screen and slide deck today)

Regardless, this is the future Jensen wants to move to. Development is tying together frameworks based on models that have already been trained to handle specific tasks, with further training and reasoning to expand the capabilities of these systems.

“The agentic system is the interface.”

And that is Enterprise AI being revolutionized by agentic systems.

Now on to physical AI.

A big challenge for physical AIs: object permanence. It’s not just learning the laws of the physical world, but keeping track of things that may not be their focus.

The hardware to make all of this happen is a trio of computers. Training on NVIDIA’s big iron hardware, inference at the edge with things like Thor, and then physical simulations using RTX Pro servers.

Jensen is also recapping the various models/frameworks NVIDIA offers for the task. Cosmos and Gr00t, which have been around for a couple of years now, and what appears to be a new model: Alpamayo.

Now rolling a video about Cosmos, NVIDIA’s physical AI simulation framework and world foundation model.

Cosmos can generate realistic video from images, and physically accurate simulations from 3D models. Even scenario prompts are enough to generate a video. “Cosmos turns compute into data.”

Cosmos has already been downloaded millions of times. And NVIDIA uses it internally for their self-driving automotive tech.

Announcing today: Alpamayo. The world’s first thinking and reasoning automotive AI.

Alpamayo isn’t just an AI for self-driving cars. But it is an AI that can explain why it is doing what it is doing, and its reasoning process that led to that decision.

Now rolling another video, this time of self-driving automotive tech. All hands-free and taken in a single long shot.

(The future of San Francisco is to be a city of robots)

NVIDIA’s video is interspersed with quotes. From what I gather, it sounds like they’ve been driving journalists around in their cars.

“We started working on self-driving cars 8 years ago”

Alpamayo is open source.

(This is the most enthusiastic I’ve seen Jensen about self-driving cars in a few years now)

The combination of NVIDIA hardware, frameworks, and now Alpamayo is the company’s first complete stack for self-driving cars.

Jensen thinks this will be one of the largest robotics industries.

Mercedes Benz CLA just went into production. It has already been rated the “world’s safest car” by one group.

Parallel to Alpamayo is the safety system that validates everything that Alpamayo does. Something that apparently took NVIDIA half a decade to build.

“We’re going to maintain the stack for as long as we shall live”

Note that the emphasis is on L4 vehicles, not L5 fully autonomous vehicles.

Ultimately, most everything here developed for self-driving automotive can also be applied to other forms of robotics.

NVIDIA is once again showing off the proof-of-concept droids they’ve been developing over the past couple of years. As well as how they were trained inside of a physically-accurate simulated environment.

How do you learn to be a robot? You do it all inside of Omniverse.

“We’re going to talk a lot more about robotics in the future”

NVIDIA has said before that they see robotics as the next great market for the company. Hence the heavy investment into robotics.

Jensen is now going on a tangent about chip design – which like everything else is becoming AI accelerated. So even the chips going into Jensen’s robots are going to be created in a simulation.

Now rolling a video about working with Siemens.

And now on to some hardware. Vera Rubin.

But first, a quick recap on the history of Vera Rubin the astronomer, and why NVIDIA named their next platform after her.

Vera Rubin is designed to address the insane demand for AI computing.

The number of tokens needed for cutting-edge inference has exploded, especially with the rise of thinking/reasoning models. And the race is on for AI to get to the next frontier.

All the while the cost per token continues to drop, making the higher number of tokens required economically viable.

NVIDIA is in full scale manufacturing of GB300 right now. And Vera Rubin will ship this year. Vera Rubin is in full production.

Now rolling a video about Vera Rubin.

1 Vera CPU + 2 Rubin GPUs.

The first Vera Rubin NVL72 rack is online.

“Moore’s Law has largely slowed”. So NVIDIA cannot keep up by just throwing more transistors at hardware. At least if they want to keep up their current pace.

So NVIDIA had to redesign all of their core chips in a single generation in order to improve performance and add functionality to keep up with client needs.

Despite only having 88 CPU cores, each one of the 176 threads on Vera can get its full performance. It is effectively a 176 core CPU.

NVIDIA has to employ extreme co-design across all of its chips in order to hit its performance goals.

Now talking about FP4 capabilities, and specifically NVIDIA’s NVFP4 format. Achieving higher throughput when the lower precision is acceptable, and using higher precision when required. All of which is handled adaptively.

And all of this is delivered with just 1.6x as many transistors for Vera Rubin versus Grace Blackwell.

The Vera Rubin compute tray is cable-free. The assembly time is down from 2 hours to 6 minutes. It is also 100% liquid cooled, versus just 80% for the Grace Blackwell compute tray.

Tying all of this together is NVIDIA’s family of networking hardware. ConnectX-9 NICs, BlueField 4 DPUs, and Spectrum-X networking platform. Networking performance has been critical in enabling scale-out scaling of NVIDIA GPU systems.

Spectrum-X is for East-West traffic, while BlueField 4 is for North-South traffic. BlueField 4 comes standard with every one of the Vera Rubin compute nodes.

NVLink 6 Switch chip employs 400G SerDes. Twice the speed of NVLink 5, and twice the speed of most everything else. So that every GPU can talk to every other GPU at the same time.

(Apparently they forgot to drain the water out of the NVL72 demo system before shipping it)

NVIDIA’s SerDes drive cables form the top of the rack to the bottom. 2 miles of copper cables in NVL72. The NVLink spine.

Vera Rubin’s power consumption is twice as high as Grace Blackwell. But NVIDIA is able to cool it with 45C water?!

NVL72 will offer 5x the inference performance, and 3.5x the training performance.

Spectrum-X chip with silicon photonics. 512 200G ports.

NVIDIA’s co-packaged optics technology was developed in conjunction with TSMC. It is essentially how NVIDIA is making faster optical networking speeds economically viable at the scale they need for a supercomputer.

Now in a segue to talking about tokens and key value (KV) caching.

Inference generates a massive amount of context data – too much to keep on AI nodes. That data either must be tossed and recomputed, or a way is found to efficiently store it.

Enter NVIDIA’s Context Memory Storage Platform.

All made possible with NVIDIA’s ConnectX and BlueField networking products.

All combined, this makes up a Vera Rubin pod.

In other news, the entire system is now capable of confidential computing. Blackwell was previously capable of confidential computing, but Grace was not. Now, Vera is, meaning it can work in concert with Rubin to allow for confidential computing (encryption) over the whole rack/pod.

Rubin can train an example model in 1/4 of the time. Or constant time with 1/4 as many GPUs.

And very quickly recapping NVIDIA’s announcements. That’s a wrap for NVIDIA’s CES 2026 presentation.",https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NVIIDA-CES-2026-Live-Blog-Hero.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 18:02:18.923783

Build Your Own Adobe Narrative Disagree with existing narratives?","In early January 2026, Jefferies downgraded Adobe to Hold, citing slower topline trends since fiscal 2023 and limited near-term revenue impact from its artificial intelligence offerings.

This move has sharpened attention on whether Adobe’s growing AI usage and integrations can translate into material, measurable revenue contributions amid rising competition.

Next, we’ll examine how Jefferies’ concerns about Adobe’s AI monetization and growth trajectory may reshape the company’s existing investment narrative.

We've found 14 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.

Adobe Investment Narrative Recap

To own Adobe today, you need to believe its creative and document software, now infused with AI, can keep customers loyal and willing to pay for subscriptions even as competition intensifies. The key near term catalyst is clearer AI monetization in products like Firefly and Acrobat AI Assistant; Jefferies’ downgrade highlights that this remains unproven in revenue terms. The biggest current risk is that faster moving AI rivals pressure Adobe’s growth and pricing power over time.

Piper Sandler’s recent reiteration of an Overweight rating and its comments on AI influenced annual recurring revenue above US$8,000,000,000 sit in sharp contrast to Jefferies’ caution. That update underscores how much of the Adobe debate now hinges on whether rising AI usage and credit consumption eventually show up as sustainable, incremental revenue, or simply deepen the value of the existing subscription base without materially speeding top line growth.

Yet beneath Adobe’s strong AI story, there is a growing concern investors should be aware of regarding intensifying competition and potential pricing pressure...

Read the full narrative on Adobe (it's free!)

Adobe's narrative projects $29.3 billion revenue and $8.7 billion earnings by 2028. This requires 9.0% yearly revenue growth and about a $1.8 billion earnings increase from $6.9 billion today.

How does Nvidia keep its car safe?

Nvidia says it has spent years building an entire AV stack that's fully traceable, running both stacks at the same time as a guardrail against accidents and scenarios you can't legislate against. A real shot across Tesla's bow.

More Alpamayo - coming to Mercedes Benz CLA

""Not only does your car drive as you would expect it to drive, it reasons about every scenario and tells you what it's about to do.""

The first AV car powered by Alpamayo is the 2025 Mercedes-Benz CLA, shipping to the U.S. in Q1. It has been rated as the world's safest car by NCAP.

Nvidia Alpamayo: A thinking, reasoning AI model for vehicles

Powered by the Cosmos AI model, Nvidia has created Alpamayo, an AI model used for autonomous vehicles. It can reason every action: From the actions it's about to take, how it reasoned that action, and then developing a trajectory.

Huang claims that it's based on a large amount of human training and supplemented by Cosmos' synthetic data. The keynote has now shifted to a real-world example of the model working in action, with a car (in San Francisco) taking turns and making decisions on the fly. Huang notes that it's impossible to get every single possible scenario, but breaking these tasks down can be understood by the AI model if it reasons through it.

Full-stack Phsyical AI: Compute becomes data

Jensen is explaining how several computers, connected through Nvidia Omniverse, can create a full-stack AI platform through training (GB300), Simulation (RTX Pro), and inference (labelled THOR). By utilizing multiple models aligned with language, compute power has become data, Jensen says.

Synthetic data, grounded by physics, can be used in a Cosmos foundation model to become physically-based, digestible data to train a new AI platform. This could curtail the requirement for real-world training data for Physical AI platforms, aligning elements like trajectory predictions into real-world, usable data for training.

Nvidia Brev: Creating closed agentic sandboxes

Using a new tool called Nvidia Brev, the company has demoed an environement that can hook up to a DGX spark inside a closed environment for a variety of AI applications, or connecting it to frontier models via HuggingFace. A couple of examples were given, including integrating it with robotics.

""Isn't that incredible?"", Jensen remarks, before mentioning that just a few years ago, it would have been impossible. Thanks to using a variety of applications, named an Agentic framework, Brev creates the architecture of applications across a closed sandbox.

AI tops leaderboards across the industry

Nvidia's models are topping leaderboards, with the hopes that it can make developers utilize and create AI agents in order to research, models, and more easily. With reasoning capabilities, AI models no longer have to understand everything in a single day.

Jensen mentioned Perplecity as an example of how it would create an AI reasoning chain to create a multi-model, making just about anything fit a certain task, which has empowered AI startups — all thanks to Nvidia's technology, of course.

— Jeffrey Kampman

Nvidia's focus on frontier models across industries

Huang reiterated that it's not a cloud distribution service, as DGX cloud winds down to R&D, it's now focused on developing frontier models like Earth 2, Cosmos, a world foundation model, GR00T for robotics and locomotion, and more.

Huang states that he open-sources these models, but also the datasets behind them, so developers understand what makes things tick, with the intention for every company to take part in the incoming AI developments. And just like that, the lights go out, and Jensen makes a joke.

— Jeffrey Kampman

Inventing a new world with AI

100 trillion dollars of industry investment is shifting over to AI, or so Jensen Huang claims. The CEO states that R&D budgets are now pouring in, perhaps to cool down claims of circular funding in the AI industry. The CEO is now shifting the conversation into a history lesson for AI models, reiterating that Agentic models like Cursor are a focus for 2026 and beyond.

— Sayem Ahmed

Jensen Huang takes to the stage

Slightly later than expected, the show has now officially begun, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang taking the stage to lay out what 2026 and beyond might hold for Nvidia. Expect Nvidia to press on topics like AI, data centers, and robotics. While it might not be quite as exciting as the launch of a new consumer graphics card, whatever is announced over the course of the keynote will likely set the tone for the rest of the industry to follow for the rest of the year.

— Sayem Ahmed

Nvidia is late to its own party

Despite a slick preshow, Nvidia has yet to officially commence its keynote, running around ten minutes later than anticipated. You'd think that with the vast resources available to Nvidia, they'd run on time. Perhaps an AI model running a calendar hallucinated somewhere?

Regardless, the industry is waiting with bated breath for things to kick off, and we'll be right here reporting the latest, as it happens.

— Sayem Ahmed

The preshow is over: T-minus 3 minutes until the keynote begins

The preshow is now over, and Huang is expected to take the stage in three minutes to kick things off in earnest. Being rolled onto the stage is a high-resolution screen, with some semi-dramatic music playing, and we'll expect to hear more shortly. While this is fun, what are the odds that the music is AI-generated?

There may be some expectation that Huang will emerge carrying some kind of object. We've seen him roll out with robots and even a shield made of chips before; surely the company has the cash for more than just a new leather jacket.

— Sayem Ahmed

Nvidia preshow kicks off CES festivities

While Jensen Huang hasn't taken to the stage yet, Nvidia has a 'pre-game' show, where its showing a manner of applications that use Nvidia tech, complete with an interview panel ahead of time. While it's a neat warm-up, don't expect anything too staggering while things are still kicking off.

Huang is set to take the stage at 1 p.m. PT, so there's not too long to wait until we get to the real meat of today's keynote.

— Sayem Ahmed

It's Jensen's world, and we're just living in it

In 2025, Nvidia had one of its best years to date. It launched the RTX 50 series, and its data center profits skyrocketed. However, 2026 paints a very different picture. With the AI industry booming, and hyperscalers shovelling investment into new data centers like there's no tomorrow, the industry is waiting with bated breath to see exactly what course Huang might plot for 2026 and beyond. Needless to say, the entire industry will hear the reverberations.

ID4,Albertsons,2026-01-05 20:56:44+00:00,Barchart.com,Albertsons's (NYSE:ACI) Q2 CY2025 Sales Top Estimates - Barchart.com,StockStory,,,,,https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36892314/albertsonss-nyseaci-q2-cy2025-sales-top-estimates,"Grocery retailer Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) beat Wall Street’s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales up 2.5% year on year to $24.88 billion.
Revenue Growth A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality.

Its non-GAAP profit of $0.55 per share was in line with analysts’ consensus estimates.

""In the second quarter, we delivered solid operating and financial results while continuing to invest in our core business and elevate the customer experience,"" said Susan Morris, Chief Executive Officer.

Company Overview

With over 20 well-known grocery banners spanning 34 states, Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) operates food and drug retail stores across the US, offering groceries, pharmacy services, and own-brand products under banners like Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons.

Revenue Growth

A company’s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years.

With $81.01 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Albertsons is a behemoth in the consumer retail sector and benefits from economies of scale, giving it an edge in distribution. This also enables it to gain more leverage on its fixed costs than smaller competitors and the flexibility to offer lower prices. However, its scale is a double-edged sword because there is only so much real estate to build new stores, placing a ceiling on its growth. For Albertsons to boost its sales, it likely needs to adjust its prices or lean into foreign markets.

As you can see below, Albertsons’s 3.1% annualized revenue growth over the last three years was sluggish as its store footprint remained unchanged.

This quarter, Albertsons reported modest year-on-year revenue growth of 2.5% but beat Wall Street’s estimates by 0.6%.

Looking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 3.5% over the next 12 months, similar to its three-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products will help support its historical top-line performance.

Store Performance

Number of Stores

A retailer’s store count often determines how much revenue it can generate.

Albertsons operated 2,264 locations in the latest quarter, and over the last two years, has kept its store count flat while other consumer retail businesses have opted for growth.

When a retailer keeps its store footprint steady, it usually means demand is stable and it’s focusing on operational efficiency to increase profitability.

Same-Store Sales

A company's store base only paints one part of the picture. When demand is high, it makes sense to open more. But when demand is low, it’s prudent to close some locations and use the money in other ways. Same-store sales gives us insight into this topic because it measures organic growth for a retailer's e-commerce platform and brick-and-mortar shops that have existed for at least a year.

Albertsons’s demand rose over the last two years and slightly outpaced the industry. On average, the company’s same-store sales have grown by 2.2% per year. Given its flat store base over the same period, this performance stems from not only increased foot traffic at existing locations but also higher e-commerce sales as demand shifts from in-store to online.

In the latest quarter, Albertsons’s same-store sales rose 2.8% year on year. This performance was more or less in line with its historical levels.

Key Takeaways from Albertsons’s Q2 Results

It was encouraging to see Albertsons beat analysts’ EBITDA expectations this quarter. We were also happy its revenue narrowly outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its gross margin missed. Overall, this print had some key positives. The stock remained flat at $17.25 immediately following the results.",https://assets.barchart.com/img/barchart-og.png,N,,2026-01-05 17:02:00.791878

FDA Accepts NDA for Low-Sodium Oxybate TRN-257 in Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Hypersomnia

At the beginning of the month, on December 9, 2025, the FDA accepted Tris Pharma’s new drug application (NDA) for TRN-257 for the treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with narcolepsy, as well as excessive daytime sleepiness in adults with idiopathic hypersomnia, with a PDUFA date set for June 20, 2026.1 The agent incorporates 2 of the company’s proprietary technology platforms, RaftWorks and LiquiXR, to achieve a controlled-release profile and support a once-nightly, low-sodium dosing regimen.

The NDA submission is supported by data from multiple pharmacokinetic and safety studies and incorporates Model-Informed Drug Development-based approaches to showcase the efficacy and safety of TRN-257. According to Tris Pharma, the submission also references the agency's prior safety and efficacy findings for currently marketed oxybate products. In addition, it includes a comprehensive Human Factors Engineering and Usability Engineering study report, which demonstrated that representative patients were generally able to perform tasks and use TRN-257 as intended when following the proposed labeling.

""Currently, patients face a difficult trade-off with existing treatments that either burden them with high sodium levels, posing significant cardiovascular risks, or require disruptive twice-nightly dosing that interrupts sleep, that otherwise is intended to induce sleep,"" Maurice M. Ohayon, MD, DSc, PhD, professor and director of the Stanford Sleep Epidemiology Research Center at Stanford University, said in a statement.1 ""As the first oxybate formulation to combine a convenient once-nightly regimen with the lowest sodium content, TRN-257 is uniquely designed to eliminate this compromise.""

FDA Clears Pivotal Phase 3 PREVAiLS Study of Pridopidine in Early, Rapidly Progressive ALS

A couple of days later, on December 11, 2025, the FDA cleared the initiation of a pivotal, 500-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial dubbed PREVAiLS, which will assess the efficacy and safety of pridopidine (Prilenia Therapeutics/Ferrer) in patients with early-stage, rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The company noted that recruitment at the first clinical trial sites in the United States is planned to begin in early 2026, with international sites expected to follow pending regulatory approval.2

PREVAiLS will enroll adults diagnosed with definite or probable ALS who are within 18 months of symptom onset across up to 60 ALS treatment centers worldwide. The trial design consists of a 48-week double-blind, placebo-controlled phase, randomized 3:2 to receive either pridopidine or placebo, followed by a 48-week open-label extension. The primary end point is change from baseline in the ALS Functional Rating Scale–Revised (ALSFRS-R), adjusted for mortality, at 48 weeks while secondary and exploratory end points include measures of speech, respiratory and bulbar function, quality of life, survival, patient-reported outcomes, and plasma biomarkers.

“This study has the clear aim of evaluating the efficacy and safety of a much-needed new treatment option for ALS,” PREVAiLS steering committee member and investigator Sabrina Paganoni, MD, PhD, co-director of Massachusetts General Hospital Neurological Clinical Research Institute, said in a statement.2 “Early detection and management are essential for preserving function, with slowing of functional decline, maintaining speech and prolonging survival being ALS therapeutic priorities. This makes pridopidine’s S1R activation mechanism of particular interest, holding promise in ALS by enhancing key cellular mechanisms and promoting neuroprotection.""

FDA Approves Inebilizumab for AChR- and MuSK-Positive Generalized Myasthenia Gravis

On the same day, on December 11, 2025, the FDA approved inebilizumab (Uplizna; Amgen) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adults who are antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR) and antimuscle specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. This marks the third FDA-approved indication for inebilizumab, following approvals in antiaquaporin-4 antibody positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and immunoglobulin G4–related disease.3

The approval of inebilizumab for gMG is supported by data from the phase 3 MINT trial (NCT04524273). In the trial, 238 patients with gMG were randomly assigned 1:1 to either intravenous ineblizumab 300 mg (n = 119) or placebo (n = 119) for a 12-month period. Change from baseline in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MD-ADL), the study’s primary end point, was statistically significant for inebilizumab-treated patients, with scores of –4.2 compared with –2.2 for those on placebo (P <.0001). The therapy showed a safe and well tolerated profile, consistent with prior safety findings.

""This approval is a truly meaningful milestone – personally, as the global principal investigator for MINT, and most importantly, for the many patients who will benefit. I’m thrilled to see a new FDA-approved option for patients living with this rare and debilitating disease, and for the clinicians who care for them,"" global principal investigator Richard J. Nowak, MD, MS, director of the Myasthenia Gravis Clinic and associate professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, told NeurologyLive®. ""This approval represents significant progress for the gMG community and adds an important new option to the clinical toolbox.""

Tolebrutinib Falls Short in Phase 3 PERSEUS Study, Forcing Decision to Redact Regulatory Submission

A few days later, on December 15, 2025, Sanofi’s tolebrutinib, an investigational Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, did not meet its end points in the phase 3 PERSEUS study (NCT04458051) of patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), and a regulatory submission is therefore not expected. In addition, it’s been reported that the FDA has pushed back its review of the agent as a treatment for nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS (nrSPMS).4

More detailed results from the global, double-blind, randomized trial are expected to be presented at an upcoming meeting. In the release, it was noted that tolebrutinib did not meet its primary end point of delaying time of onset of 6-month composite confirmed disability progression (CDP) compared with placebo in the study cohort, which included those aged 18-55 with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of between 2.0 and 6.5.

""We are disappointed by today’s results; however, we do believe that these results will improve our understanding of the underlying disease biology of multiple sclerosis,"" Houman Ashrafian, executive vice president and head of Research & Development at Sanofi, said in a statement.4 ""We extend our deepest appreciation to the study participants, their families, and healthcare professionals who support our scientific and innovative vision. Our commitment to the multiple sclerosis community remains unchanged, as do our efforts to pursue novel advancements that address existing unmet needs and we remain confident in the value tolebrutinib can bring to those living with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.""

FDA Expands Indication for n‐Butyl Cyanoacrylate in Chronic Subdural Hematoma

A few days later, on December 18, 2025, the FDA approved the expanded indication for Johnson & Johnson's n‐butyl cyanoacrylate (Trufill) liquid embolic system as an adjunct to surgery for middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization in patients with symptomatic subacute and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH). The company noted that therapy has been used in neurovascular embolization for more than 25 years and has supported the treatment of arteriovenous malformations since its initial FDA approval in 2000.5

The approval was supported by findings from the MEMBRANE randomized controlled trial (NCT04816591), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of MMA embolization in approximately 376 adult patients with cSDH. In trial, researchers observed a statistically significant treatment benefit with n-butyl cyanoacrylate compared with standard of care in patients treated with or without surgery (P = .044).2 Overall, the study demonstrated superior efficacy of n-butyl cyanoacrylate and supported its safety in the treatment of cSDH.

“The MEMBRANE trial provides high-quality evidence that treating the subdural membrane itself with MMA embolization with Trufill nBCA as an adjunct to surgery prevents recurrence in patients with chronic subdural hematomas,"" investigator Chris Kellner, MD, the director of Cerebrovascular & Intercerebral Hemorrhage programs at Mount Sinai told NeurologyLive®. "" We are proud at Mount Sinai to have led the clinical trial and to partner with J&J in the future to train neurointerventionists and educate the community about this new treatment.""

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-05 19:42:06+00:00,Fortune,"After Nvidia's Groq deal, these AI chip startups are in play—and one hoping to disrupt them all",Sharon Goldman,,,,,https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-groq-deal-ai-chip-startups-in-play/,"It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.
Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models.
But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote.
A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.” Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally.
His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.","The Groq deal bolsters the standing of other startups building their own AI chips, including Cerebras, D-Matrix, and SambaNova—which Intel has reportedly signed a term sheet to acquire—as well as newer players like U.K.-based chip startup Fractile. It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.

Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research, pointed to the Microsoft-backed D-Matrix, which raised $275 million last month at a $2 billion valuation. Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now,” Freund said. “I suspect their next round will be at a much higher valuation.”

Cerebras, another inference-focused chip company, also appears well positioned. Known for its dinner-plate-sized “wafer-scale” chip designed to run extremely large models on a single piece of silicon, Cerebras has filed for an IPO after a previous delay. Freund said the company has increasingly been viewed as a potential acquisition target as well. “You don’t want to wait until after the IPO, when it’s more expensive,” he said. “From that perspective, Cerebras is sitting pretty right now.”

Nvidia-Groq deal has clarified market’s direction

Executives at these companies say Nvidia’s move has helped clarify the market’s direction. “When [the Nvidia-Groq deal] happened, we said, ‘Finally, the market recognizes it,’” Sid Sheth, CEO of D-Matrix, told Fortune. “I think what Nvidia has really done is they said, Okay, this approach is a winning approach.”

And Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman posted on X that, in the past, the perception that Nvidia GPUs were all you needed for AI acted as a moat, keeping AI chip startups for nibbling away at Nvidia’s marketshare. But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote. “It reflects a growing industry reality—the inference market is fragmenting, and a new category has emerged where speed isn’t a feature—it’s the entire value proposition. A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.”

Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said the chip sector remains a difficult one for venture investors, given the high capital requirements and long timelines. “A lot of VCs stopped investing in chips 10 or 15 years ago,” Murphy said. “It’s capital-intensive, it takes years to get a product out, and the outcomes are hard to predict.”

That said, he pointed to Fireworks, and AI inference platform which raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October, as a startup with a technical advantage, thanks to a founding team filled with engineers who built Pytorch an. But he added that it remains unclear how much of the current enthusiasm reflects genuine technical differentiation. “it’s hard to tell who’s really got something significant versus the tide is [raising] all boats, which is what seems to be going on,” he said, adding that consolidation across the sector now appears increasingly likely.

New entrant seeks true disruption

But at least one veteran of the AI hardware world argues that even today’s inference-focused startups are not truly disruptive.

Naveen Rao, former SVP of AI at Databricks and founder of MosaicML, recently left Databricks to start Unconventional AI, which last month confirmed a massive $475 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures. His critique: companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.

After Nvidia’s Groq deal validated demand for faster, more efficient inference, startups that fit neatly into today’s AI stack suddenly look far more valuable — not because they reinvented computing, Rao argues, but because they work within it. Unconventional AI is pursuing a more radical path: building new hardware that exploits the physical behavior of silicon itself, and redesigning neural networks to match it.

“We’ve been building the same fundamental machine for 80 years, a numeric digital machine,” he said. “But there was never one workload that dominated even more than 2% of all compute cycles.” That is changing, he explained: In a few years, 95% of all compute will be used for AI.

From that standpoint, it’s important to construct an entirely different machine than what is built today, he said. However, Rao says the effort could take five years or more to bear fruit — and is not intended to capitalize on the current inference boom.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/54195259582_a575397bf5_o-e1738260860238.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-05 15:01:38.276701

Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.
For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss.
How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?” AI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added.","Senior execs from NBCUniversal, Amazon‘s AWS, Adobe and ad agency WPP discussed the tricky balance between embracing AI and safeguarding IP during a panel discussion Monday at CES.

“We’ve been talking about personalization for decades,” said Hannah Elsakr, VP of GenAI New Business Ventures at Adobe. To that point, she continued, “Nobody wants to see the same ad three times.” Most ad content, she added, “is dead on arrival after a week, maybe two weeks. … We’ve talked about a promo taking two-plus weeks to execute. Now with AI – and with I want to put the word ‘responsible AI’ out there – you can do it in hours.

Programmers and advertisers are “in a fight for attention,” Elsakr said. “So, being able to be relevant and let the fan drive the narrative, that, to me, is the new definition of personalization of the brand.”

Kristina Shepard, EVP of Streaming & Performance Sales & Partnerships at NBCU cited a number of initiatives at the media giant that are designed to take advantage of the speed of AI tools.

Buyers and sellers of ad time can now use AI “to get down, not just to a show or an episode, but to a scene level,” Shepard said. “Contextual targeting in some regard has gotten a bad rap because it has seemed very basic, right? An advertiser would say, ‘I want to reach women 25 to 54, give me the top 100 shows.’ Now, AI can allow us to actually identify scenes. For example, there might be an advertiser who wants to be the first ad in an ad pod right after a holiday kiss. How do we make that advertiser really, really relevant in that moment?”

AI can create “a great marriage between the viewer and the advertiser experience,” Shepard added. “We basically beta-tested this with a luxury brand, you know, doing contextual targeting in VOD content in 2026, you’ll see this in live” at upcoming NBCU events like the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics.

One scenario, she said, would be enabling creative messages to allude to what is happening in a live sporting event. “Imagine a touchdown happens in the third quarter of a game and that next ad pod says, ‘Congratulations for the touchdown brought you by said brand.'”

In the case of the luxury brand, she added, NBCU research found that viewers got 27% more enjoyment from that experience, and search engagement jumped 56% for the brand. Search and purchase intent, the so-called “lower funnel” parts of the advertising experience (as opposed to upper-funnel efforts to create awareness), are “the holy grail for all advertisers,” Shepard said. NBCU’s experience “shows the benefit that television can be both an upper and lower funnel medium.”

Samira Panah Bakhtiar, General Manager of Media & Entertainment, Games, and Sports at AWS, pointed to the larger context in which all viewing and advertising is occurring.

“I think we have to think about where the audiences are,” she said. “Gen Z right now is spending 54% more time on social and they’re spending 26% less time on traditional viewing experiences. And if you look at some of the creators right now who are really able to capitalize themselves in a marvelous way.” She cited Dude Perfect or Mr. Beast, whose valuations are “rivaling more traditional brands.”

The emergence of creators “isn’t just an anomaly. These are creators who have very, very loyal fan bases who have learned how to be able to really cultivate production level content and higher media executives and get institutional investment and have figured out ways to be able to only create that content, but distribute that content at scale.”

Any companies “seeking this to reinvent themselves, or be able to capitalize on this moment,” she said, need to “really pay attention to the multi-generational preferences that exist in the viewing sphere right now.”",https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2806-e1767638758106.jpeg?w=1024,N,,2026-01-05 15:13:58.140043

Over the past month, Parker Hannifin Inc. (NYSE:PH) stock increased by 5.63%, and in the past year, by 43.49%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders are optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.

Parker Hannifin P/E Compared to Competitors

The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future.

Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 39.37 in the Machinery industry, Parker Hannifin Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 31.85. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued.

In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth.

Click to get this free report Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL): Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Ralph Lauren (RL) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ralph Lauren is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.

Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices

The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.

For Ralph Lauren, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.

Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions

As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.

The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>> .

Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ralph Lauren

For the fiscal year ending March 2026, this upscale clothing company is expected to earn $15.29 per share, which is unchanged compared with the year-ago reported number.

Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ralph Lauren. Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3.3%.

Bottom Line

Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of ""buy"" and ""sell"" ratings for its entire universe of more than 4,000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a ""Strong Buy"" rating and the next 15% get a ""Buy"" rating. So, the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature, making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.

The upgrade of Ralph Lauren to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions, implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.

Pharmacy Times: What changes in policy or practice are needed to expand the impact of psychiatric pharmacists in SUD treatment?
At the VA, where I practice, the states where I hold pharmacist licenses don’t allow pharmacists to have DEA licenses, and the requirements are very specific.
That said, psychiatric pharmacists bring so much value that integration into health systems should clearly be beneficial and cost-saving overall.
Overall, psychiatric pharmacists have a lot to offer, and that’s demonstrated by those working in the field every day.","Pharmacy Times: How do psychiatric pharmacists collaborate with interdisciplinary teams to improve SUD care and patient outcomes?

Aaron Salwan, PharmD, MPH, BCCP: We certainly talked about how we interface with physicians or prescribers. Another aspect that I don’t know if anyone appreciates, or has the same experience in a different specialty, is that we work very closely with case managers, social workers, and counselors. We could have the best idea for what medicine could be helpful, but if the patient has no way to access it, then it’s not useful at all.

I have a close relationship with our counselors and discharge planners, trying to ensure that as patients move from one phase of treatment to another, there’s not a lapse in care. Another, more clinical approach is that if I observe a patient in a group and see their behavior is different or has changed, and I can link it to a medication that was newly started or adjusted, that turns into more of an interdisciplinary conversation.

Instead of going directly to the physician and saying, “Hey, I think you need to do this,” it involves other members of the care team. We ask questions like, “Did you notice this?” or “I think this patient has this type of issue—what do you think?” It becomes truly collaborative before we pull the trigger on a change like that.

Pharmacy Times: What changes in policy or practice are needed to expand the impact of psychiatric pharmacists in SUD treatment?

Ashley Maister, PharmD, BCCP: As someone who practices with a scope of practice, I think the ability to do things—not necessarily independently—but to prescribe and get medication to the patient faster is really important. Being able to follow through on what we’ve already discussed and agreed to with the patient is critical. With the removal of the X-waiver, allowing psychiatric pharmacists, especially those working in substance use disorder clinics, to prescribe buprenorphine or controlled substances would improve continuity of care.

At the VA, where I practice, the states where I hold pharmacist licenses don’t allow pharmacists to have DEA licenses, and the requirements are very specific. If you’re not at the VA and you’re working in a state like Pennsylvania, you can’t, for example, have an Idaho pharmacist license. The federal umbrella helps in some ways, but it also adds extra expense and upkeep.

If pharmacists, regardless of the state where they practice, were able to have DEA licenses and independently initiate and manage buprenorphine, I think that would expand their impact and strengthen their role in patient follow-up.

Salwan: That’s exactly where my mind went as well—the ability to prescribe and have a DEA license. It does seem that laws have changed so pharmacists in nearly every state are able to administer long-acting injectables. I don’t know what the uptake has been, but there’s a need for reimbursement, so pharmacists in any setting are inclined to offer that service.

Many of the skills pharmacists provide aren’t always billable or tied to a diagnostic code that would make adding a psychiatric pharmacist to a clinic seem profitable. That said, psychiatric pharmacists bring so much value that integration into health systems should clearly be beneficial and cost-saving overall. From a more structural or infrastructure point of view, there also needs to be greater support for addiction services and harm reduction services.

This includes sterile syringe programs, drug testing devices, and access to Narcan or naloxone. These are things we can never have enough of given the needs of our population.

Its rival Novo Nordisk (NVO) made an announcement that shook up Lilly stock Monday.

Drugmakers are in stiff competition to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market oral weight-loss drugs vs. the current injectable treatments. Novo Nordisk hit a milestone Monday and pulled ahead in the battle.

Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound are in a class of medicines called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are designed to help lower blood sugar and support weight loss.

Lilly stock fell as Novo announced it will offer its new Wegovy weight-loss pill in the U.S. beginning Monday. Novo will sell the Wegovy pill at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies, including CVS Health (CVS) and Costco (COST), as well as its own direct outlet.

Eli Lilly makes weight-loss drugs, including Zepbound, a weekly injectable treatment. But Lilly has an investigational, once-daily oral medication named orforglipron that is being studied for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Orforglipron is currently in clinical trials. Lilly said preliminary results for orforglipron have been positive, and additional data is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2026.

Eli Lilly is also on the IBD Big Cap 20 and an IBD Leaderboard watchlist name. It was an IBD SwingTrader holding, but was removed with Monday's drop.

Eli Lilly Stock Falls On Rival News

Eli Lilly stock reversed nearly 4% lower after initially rising to start Monday' session. Shares undercut their 21-day exponential moving average and are testing their 10-week moving average.

The drug stock sits in a newly formed first-stage flat base with a 1,111.99 buy point, according to MarketSurge pattern recognition. The buy point also stands as its all-time high, reached on Nov. 26. Lilly stock formed a bullish three-weeks pattern with a 1,088.48 entry point within the flat base.

The flat base formed after its rapid climb from a consolidation pattern breakout in early November, triggering ""Ants Indicators.""

Its relative strength line is falling with Monday's drop. But its IBD Timeliness Rating of A indicates potential positive relative price performance over the next 12 months.

Its IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A indicates heavy institutional buying over the last 13 weeks. And its beefy 2.2 up/down volume ratio shows positive demand over the last 50 days.

The drug stock holds a respectable 90 Relative Strength Rating whereas Novo Nordisk has been a true laggard with its 14 RS Rating.

Lilly Profit Expected To Rise

Eli Lilly reported a blockbuster quarter in September with nearly 500% profit growth and 54% sales growth.

Lilly's profit took off in 2024 and more than doubled to $12.99 per share after dropping 20% in 2023. Full-year 2025 estimates expect 83% growth to $23.77 per share, followed by a 37% jump to $32.50 per share in 2026.

Its revenue growth averaged around 45% over the last four quarters. But forecasts see growth slowing to the 32% to 34% range over the next two quarters.

Lastly, Lilly stock holds an ideal 99 Composite Rating and a 98 Earnings Per Share Rating.

Here are some of the laws and policies that will take effect in 2026—many of which continue to push forward on important issues for workers despite what the federal government has in store.

Anti-DEI measures

Trump has made anti-DEI policies a focal point of his time in office, kicking off this year with a number of executive orders that forced federal agencies to terminate all DEI-related policies and programs and stripped away a requirement for federal contractors that had been a crucial element of diversifying the workforce. That means, going into 2026, all federal DEI programs have been eliminated—but there are a number of state-level bills that seek to curtail how DEI is utilized in hiring and across public education.

In Ohio, for example, legislation that passed this year prohibits any consideration of DEI in hiring decisions at public colleges and universities. Similar laws in Kansas, Idaho, and Wyoming will curtail DEI programs for hiring across higher education.

Meanwhile, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—the agency tasked with enforcing antidiscrimination laws in employment—has made clear that corporate DEI programs will be under greater scrutiny going into 2026.

The use of AI in hiring

As companies have embedded AI into their hiring process, many HR teams have started relying on automated résumé screeners and other AI tools. In 2026, three laws will take effect at the state level to create some guardrails around how AI is being used for employment decisions, following in the footsteps of New York City and California, which have already adopted AI in hiring laws.

Colorado and Texas are introducing broader AI governance laws that also explicitly call for more oversight of how the technology is used in the hiring process to ensure it is not discriminatory. In Illinois, the law is an amendment of the state’s Human Rights Act and regulates how workers are impacted by the use of AI in all employment decisions. At the federal level, a bipartisan bill introduced in Congress last month would—if passed—force employers to disclose when layoffs are caused by AI.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-191464809-these-laws-will-change-how-you-work-in-2026.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 14:16:05.252416

And as we’ve grown, we’ve reworked customer service and logistics… We’ve raised our game.","The Bradery has returned to independence. After three years within the Showroomprivé group, the private-sales platform for premium brands and experiences has been reacquired in full by its founders, Edouard Caraco and Timothée Linyer. On December 22, Showroomprivé announced it had sold its 52.75% stake in the company for €19 million, a deal accompanied by additional terms and performance-related earn-outs for the Parisian gem. This brings fresh performance pressure for The Bradery. Edouard Caraco shares with the background to this takeover, his vision for the company’s development- underpinned by the app’s performance- and the founding duo’s plans in the luxury sector.

FashionNetwork.com: Showroomprivé has officially confirmed that it has sold its majority stake in The Bradery to you. When did you start negotiating this takeover, given that the group's initial plan was to acquire 100% of the capital? What were the main points of discussion, given the group's financial challenges?

Edouard Caraco: The takeover stemmed from several factors. For me, the key was that Tim (co-founder Timothée Linyer) and I were convinced of the market’s potential. We spent a great deal of time over the past year preparing the project, and that really drove the discussions. We felt as though we were letting go of our baby, even though we were only at the beginning of what we were capable of achieving. Reacquiring The Bradery is about taking a long-term view. I think that when we ceded the majority stake, we were also less mature. We were in a rush about everything. I still like to move fast, but I now see that continuity is a very positive virtue in an economic environment that can be unstable. That’s what we offer our partner brands, our customers, and our team.

FNW: Yes, but why did you give up the majority stake when Showroomprivé came in?

EC: When Showroomprivé came in, it was the end of the Covid period. We had experienced a very strong surge after our launch, and we didn’t really know whether we had been propelled by the online consumption boom of that period or whether we had the opportunity to build a longer-term business. And, as I said, we were young and in a hurry. Since then, the company has continued to grow strongly. Tim and I have been friends since we were 10. We feel incredibly fortunate to have a company that performs, that’s growing, with an amazing team, and where we both enjoy coming to work every day.

FNW: How are you financing this share buyback? It's a substantial sum, so did you bring in new partners?

EC: We wanted to take back 100% of the company. We had no desire to change shareholders, either now or in the medium term. For us, the deal was clear: either we regained 100% of the capital by financing the acquisition with debt, or we saw through the initial agreement and sold 100% of our shares. Our banks supported us- they were brilliant on the project- so it was possible.

FNW: The agreement also includes a vendor loan of three million euros. Between your repayments and the commitments to the Showroomprivé group, doesn't this put a lot of pressure on the company's profitability over the next few years?

EC: The Bradery is a fast-growing company. And of course we must maintain the level of profitability that stems from the teams’ work. But we based our plan on the level we have today.

FNW: In your results filed for 2024, you mention a net profit of over €4 million on turnover of €62 million. What are your 2025 results?

EC: Showroomprivé is a consolidated, listed group, so I’m not going to comment on the figures. What I can say is that we recorded strong double-digit growth in 2025. And if we maintain our profitability for 10 years, we’ll have no problem repaying the debt.

FNW: That's the financial part. But leaving a group also implies adjustments. What reorganisation and process changes are you going to have to implement?

EC: This was really the point that prompted us to pursue the buyback. We have kept our team- even as we grew from 40 to 70 people- our model, our premises and our processes. And Tim and I have remained very hands-on at The Bradery. I look after sales and Tim handles marketing. We knew there would be no friction. And honestly, if it had taken six months to transform the company, I don’t think we would have wanted to go for it. I believe this also influenced Showroomprivé’s management in their decision. In our absence, it would have required a significant implementation effort. We use for our CMS and we hadn’t migrated to Showroomprivé’s internal processes. The only area where we benefited from their clout was logistics. But we have strong relationships with our carriers.

An app at the heart of the model

FNW: Since 2022, you've significantly increased the number of The Bradery's operations and opened new verticals such as travel- as Showroomprivé also did.

EC: We have grown very independently. Historically, The Bradery is a private-sales player in premium ready-to-wear. But today we’ve built an offering that very much meets the expectations of the audience we want to appeal to: young women aged 25–35 who are looking for premium offers. She wants to find fashion on the platform, but she also wants experiences. That’s why we’ve developed offers for gyms, travel, and concerts. We want to become the shopping destination for this generation. In this respect, we have developed our own processes. What Showroomprivé clearly gave us is ambition. They taught us to plan ahead. We’re much smaller, more niche and more selective in our offering.

FNW: What growth drivers are you considering?

EC: We have several important priorities. Internationalising the business is one of them. We only generate 5% of our sales from exports, concentrated in the Benelux countries and Spain- and mainly in Belgium. So we need to develop a real strategy for our presence in neighbouring countries. We’re going to organise ourselves to reach the Benelux countries, Spain, and Italy. This means proposing an offer that appeals to local customers, with a relevant offer for each country. If you think you’ll succeed just by translating the site, you’re deluding yourself. Entrepreneurial success is about the people you manage to bring together.

FNW: You've diversified your offering, but what share does fashion still represent?

EC: It’s not the fastest-growing vertical; we’ve seen particularly strong growth in beauty and home. But it remains the largest part of our business.

FNW: And how have you maintained its attractiveness as you’ve expanded your offer, given that initially exclusivity also came from a limited number of operations?

EC: It’s a topic we’ve worked on extensively to improve the customer experience. To that end, we’ve moved from an online strategy to an app-first strategy. Of course, we still have a website, with a new version going live in the first half of this year. But we’ve invested heavily in the app, with the aim of building daily habits for our customers. They log on every morning to discover the latest offers. And we now generate 70% of our sales via the app.

FNW: Successful app launches are rare. What's your formula?

EC: The data show that customers using the app are more engaged than site visitors. They come back more often and purchase more frequently. We’ve hired specialists to improve the experience and encourage repeat visits by personalising the journey as much as possible and making the purchasing process as easy as possible. Buying via the app is as simple as ordering an Uber. And as we’ve grown, we’ve reworked customer service and logistics… We’ve raised our game.

FNW: And how do you manage to generate profitable growth at a time when consumer spending is struggling and digital performance has been more challenging in recent seasons?

EC: Across all operations, we work with brands, but we take a prudent, common-sense approach to generating profitability. We’re still very modest in size and very humble about the global context. I look at what Veepee and Showroomprivé have achieved with a lot of admiration, and I hope we’ll be their size one day. Simply maintaining their level of activity at such scale already seems a success to me. Beyond that, I believe that, in the current context, our size gives us the agility to be responsive and opportunistic, and to set up operations very quickly- with brands- in 48–72 hours. I see that as a competitive advantage. Incidentally, another growth lever for The Bradery is physical sales.

FNW: Why, when your expertise is online?

EC: We started in December and it worked very well. We’ve worked with Maison , Levi’s, Drôle de Monsieur… I think a lot of brands understand that digital and physical complement each other. And there’s a shift back to physical retail, particularly among customers looking for premium offers. Our customers expect it. But it’s also important to remember that we’re obsessed with profitability. We’re always balancing the provision of solutions for partners with keeping the books in order. So for physical operations, we’re taking a pop-up approach to control our investments. And we’re going to continue like this in 2026, managing it on a variable-cost basis, with two to three operations per month.

LAS VEGAS, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to give a speech ​on Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in ‌Las Vegas, potentially revealing new details about product plans for the world's ‌most valuable listed company as it faces increasing competition from both rivals and its own customers.

Prediction Market powered by

Less than two weeks ago, the company scooped up talent and chip technology from startup ⁠Groq, including executives who ‌were instrumental in helping Alphabet's Google design its own AI chips. While Google is a ‍major Nvidia customer, its own chips have emerged as one of Nvidia's biggest threats as Google works closely with Meta Platforms and ​others to chip away at Nvidia's AI stronghold.

At the ‌same time, Nvidia is eager to show that its latest products can outperform older chips like the H200, which U.S. President Donald Trump has allowed to flow to China. Reuters has reported that the chip, which was the predecessor ⁠to Nvidia's current flagship ""Blackwell"" chip, is ​in high demand in China, ​which has alarmed China hawks across the U.S. political spectrum.

Huang's speech is scheduled to begin at 4 ‍p.m. EST (2100 ⁠GMT). Other key speakers at the annual trade show this year include AMD CEO Lisa Su, the CEO ⁠of Finnish health tech company Oura, Tom Hale, and PC maker Lenovo's ‌CEO, Yuanqing Yang.

We may have rested for the festive period but the world of technology did not. Here are five big stories you might have missed while we were away.

1. Meta buys Manus

Manus is a China-based agentic AI company which hailed an arranged marriage to Meta Platforms as “validation of our pioneering work” on general iterations of the technology.

Meta Platforms stated Manus launched its first general AI agent during 2025, and had served more than 147 trillion tokens and created in excess of 80 million virtual computers by the time of its announcement on 29 December.

The AI company is set to bolster Meta Platforms broader AI efforts targeting consumer and business segments.

Financial Times reported the company was once considered to be the “next DeepSeek”, but noted there could be opposition to the takeover among regulators in the US and China.

2. SoftBank Group ups OpenAI investment

The Japanese giant declared it had “fully satisfied its commitment to invest in OpenAI” after completing an additional outlay of $22.5 billion through its SoftBank Vision Fund 2 on 26 December.

SoftBank’s holding in OpenAI was taken to 11 per cent.

It pumped $7.5 billion into the US company and raised $11 billion from third-party investors earlier in 2025.

The Japanese company’s chair and CEO Masayoshi Son said it is “deeply aligned” with OpenAI’s broader ambitions for the technology and the latter’s chief Sam Altman highlighted time-to-market benefits from the tie-up.

3. SKT gives AI hyperscale

South Korean operator SK Telecom (SKT) unveiled an AI model it believes will prove foundational to the nation’s goals for the technology.

The A.Z K1 model “marks the beginning of a full-stack AI ecosystem, encompassing all areas from semiconductors to services”, SKT stated.

A.Z K1 features 519 billion parameters and is a bump to Korean ambitions to rival the US and China in AI technology leadership.

The model feeds information to smaller versions with a particular focus on those with less than 70 billion parameters. SKT intends to provide A.X K1 through its A-dot set-up, among other methods, giving it a potential market of 10 million users from the off.

SKT believes the model will also positively impact South Korea’s semiconductor sector by boosting verification of memory bandwidth and inter-GPU communication speed.

4. RAM costs rocket

Various news outlets predicted a tough 2026 for consumer electronics, in particular PCs and smartphones due to a shortage in RAM.

BBC News reported RAM demand is being driven by the requirements of AI data centres, noting the memory type is as important an element as processors which typically dominate headlines relating to the sites.

Experts told the news outlet higher memory costs would likely be passed on to consumers, speculating this could in turn impact demand for new smartphones and PCs.

The reports were sparked by an IDC analysis in mid-December 2025 in which it warned the situation could go beyond “a cyclical shortage driven by a mismatch in supply and demand”.

5. Apple cuts Vision Pro production

IDC figures also feature in reports Apple cut production of its Vision Pro headset, which the analyst company separately noted struggled to gain traction in terms of shipments during 2025.

Financial Times reported changes in the output from Vision Pro manufacturer Luxshare and highlighted a shift in Apple’s marketing spending, each pitched as a sign the company is falling short in terms of wooing consumers.

The IDC figures referenced offered a gloomy outlook for mixed and virtual reality headsets as a whole, with the company predicting shipments in 2025 would be down 42.8 per cent year-on-year but are likely to pick up again this year.",https://assets.mobileworldlive.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/06105007/Newspaper_train_SS_generic.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:01:27.868822

The conference, hosted by the Consumer Technology Association, takes place from Jan. 5 to Jan. 9 at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas.

We will keep you posted on all the retail action on the ground, but here is a preview of what the CES retail programing will cover.

A panel on agentic AI focused on AI agents in the real world is just one of the event’s many Monday offerings. Chandhu Nair, SVP of data, artificial intelligence, and innovation at Lowe’s, will give the audience a home improvement retailer’s perspective on the topic.

On Tuesday, technology’s big show will have a session with Best Buy CEO Corie Barry, who will talk about getting people, software, and services to actually work together instead of fighting against each other.

Last year, Best Buy underwent a rebrand with a holographic mascot and a new tagline—“Imagine that”—as the retailer positions itself to become consumers’ go-to source for technology items. In August 2025, Best Buy also introduced its third-party marketplace to build additional income streams through wider product assortment and advertising.

That same day, beauty and fashion industry experts, including Oscar de la Renta CMO Chloe Popescu and Kimberly Villatoro, CEO of Patrick Ta Beauty, will be on a panel to discuss how social platforms are merging content and community to create immersive, shoppable experiences.

On Wednesday, Kroger will host a panel called “Irrational consumers: how to grow brands in an unreasonable world.” The session will decode how brands can understand why shoppers make weird decisions and use that insight to grow in 2026.

A panel called “The future of ‘search’ at retail” on Thursday will delve into how AI agents transform traditional retail search based on people’s preferences, budget, and style? Attendees will hear from Justin Honaman, global head of worldwide retail, restaurants, and consumer goods at Amazon, and Egan Brinkman, managing director of commerce at Google, along with executives from Microsoft and Pinterest.

Another notable session on Thursday called “The new retail experience in the AI-powered store” will feature executives from Tractor Supply Company—the Brentwood, Tennessee-based farm products and home improvement retailer—and big box retailer Target that takes attendees behind the scenes to show how everything from inventory and logistics to checkout and service are changing thanks to AI.

See our latest analysis for Uber Technologies.

That downgrade lands after a tougher few months for the stock, with a 30 day share price return of 9.26% decline and a 90 day share price return of 15.28% decline, even though the 1 year total shareholder return of 24.96% and 3 year total shareholder return of about 3x still point to strong longer run momentum that is now being questioned as robotaxis, tax changes in the UK and potential deals like SpotHero reshape how investors think about Uber’s risk profile.

If this kind of shake up has you reassessing your options, it could be a good time to scan other high growth tech and AI stocks that might benefit or compete as autonomous tech rolls out.

With a recent 30-day return of a 9.26% decline and a 90-day return of a 15.28% decline, yet a 1-year total return near 25% and about 3x over three years, is Uber now attractively priced, or is the market already reflecting expectations for future growth in the share price?

Most Popular Narrative: 26.1% Undervalued

Uber Technologies' most followed narrative pegs fair value at about US$112 per share compared with the last close at US$82.86, setting up a meaningful debate on what the market is pricing in.

Significant investments and accelerating partnerships in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and electrification (with Waymo, Lucid, Nuro, etc.) position Uber to benefit from secular industry shifts. Successful AV commercialization could transform long-term cost structures and profitability, boosting future earnings potential. Progressive scaling of high-margin ancillary revenue streams such as advertising, data/tech platform externalization, and Uber One loyalty are supporting margin expansion and enhancing long-term earning power.

Read the complete narrative.

Curious what earnings path and margin mix get Uber from today’s profitability to that higher fair value? The projections rely on specific revenue growth, margin reset and future P/E assumptions that you can only see laid out in full inside the narrative.

Result: Fair Value of $112.06 (UNDERVALUED)

Have a read of the narrative in full and understand what's behind the forecasts.

However, there is still a real chance that heavy spending on autonomous partnerships and tougher competition across ride hailing and AV could pressure margins and weaken the thesis.

There is plenty to be excited about in HP’s latest announcements, led by the new HP OmniBook Ultra 14. The company describes it as the world’s slimmest consumer notebook to offer high-end AI performance, and the specifications support that positioning. Buyers can choose between an HP-exclusive Snapdragon X2 Elite processor, capable of delivering up to 85 trillion operations per second for running multiple AI applications simultaneously, or next-generation Intel Core Ultra processors aimed at more graphics-intensive workloads.

Despite everything HP has packed into the new OmniBook Ultra 14, the laptop remains highly portable. It is 52 per cent lighter than its predecessor and five per cent thinner than the 2025 Apple MacBook Air 13 with the M4 chip, while still featuring a vivid 3K OLED display. The device also includes a posture-detection feature designed to prompt users if they begin slouching or holding their neck at an uncomfortable angle.

For users who prefer a stationary workstation, the HP OmniStudio X 27 all-in-one offers a compelling alternative. The company says it is the world’s first Neo LED all-in-one PC with dual 100 per cent colour coverage, positioning it as a strong option for designers and content creators. Internally, the system is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and can be configured with an optional NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 GPU.

HP is also pushing innovation with Thunderbolt Share, a new feature that allows users to connect a laptop directly to an all-in-one PC. The setup lets users control both devices with a single keyboard and mouse, or share the all-in-one’s high-quality webcam. It also introduces Surface View, a camera feature that allows the lens to tilt downward so users can share sketches or notes on their desk during video calls.

The broader update touches nearly every corner of HP’s consumer lineup. The OmniBook family now includes the X, 7, 5 and 3 series, each aimed at different needs and budgets. Notably, the OmniBook 3 16, powered by Snapdragon X, is claimed to deliver up to 45 hours of battery life, setting a new benchmark for endurance in consumer AI PCs, and something we at CGMagazine will need to test for ourselves.

Rounding out the announcements is the updated HP Chromebook Plus x360 14, which combines a rugged, drop-tested design with a 360-degree hinge and Google’s latest artificial intelligence tools. From the looks of things, it is a solid entry, especially for people who want to avoid the complexities of Windows or macOS, in favour of a more streamlined overall experience.

With these releases, HP is presenting a clear view of where it sees consumer computing heading, toward smarter and more adaptable hardware designed to support modern digital lifestyles. Early impressions suggest there is much to be interested in across the new lineup.",https://cdn.cgmagonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ces-2026-hp-refreshes-its-pc-lineup-with-snapdragon-power-and-serious-ai-ambitions-2025-12-28-255586.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:01:02.710432

As a result, both Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to raise graphics card prices in stages starting in early 2026.","The global computer hardware market is facing growing strain as supplies of Nvidia’s (NVDA) latest gaming graphics cards remain tight. Retailers in Germany and Japan say they cannot secure enough units of the RTX 50 series, with some warning prices could climb toward $5,000 by the end of the year.

The core issue is a worldwide memory shortage. Large AI data centers are buying massive amounts of memory chips, which leave fewer parts available for consumer products like gaming graphics cards. As a result, supply has weakened just as demand remains strong.

In Germany, a major PC parts retailer said its distributor has limited orders of the RTX 5070 to five units at a time, while stopping deliveries of higher models such as the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090. Similarly, a leading Japanese electronics retailer in Tokyo has begun limiting customers to one high-memory graphics card per purchase, while also warning that future deliveries are uncertain.

Meanwhile, NVDA shares rose 1.26% on Friday, closing at $188.85.

AI Demand Reshapes the GPU Market

The memory shortage is changing how graphics cards are built and priced. According to industry research firm TrendForce, memory now makes up more than 80% of a GPU’s total cost. This share has risen sharply as prices for advanced memory types have increased by several hundred percent in recent months.

Major suppliers such as SK Hynix have shifted focus away from consumer memory toward high-margin memory used in AI accelerators. Internal company forecasts suggest tight supply for consumer memory could last until at least 2028, which limits how quickly the gaming market can recover.

As a result, both Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are expected to raise graphics card prices in stages starting in early 2026. Reports indicate that AMD has already begun modest increases, while Nvidia may follow soon after. Over time, repeated price hikes could push top-tier cards well above their original launch prices.

Production Cuts and Price Hikes

In addition, Nvidia is reportedly planning to reduce gaming GPU production by 30% to 40% in the first half of 2026 compared with last year. Models that use large amounts of memory are expected to see the biggest cuts, as memory supply remains the main constraint.

Meanwhile, Nvidia has informed partners that it plans to restart production of the RTX 3060, a graphics card first released in 2021. This older model uses a different type of memory that is more available today, which may help Nvidia keep a presence in the lower-priced gaming market while shortages continue.

Overall, the situation highlights how rising AI demand is reshaping the balance between data center and consumer hardware, with lasting effects on pricing, supply, and profit focus across the semiconductor industry.

Is Nvidia Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

On the Street, Nvidia holds a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average NVDA stock price target is $262.79, implying a 39.15% upside from the current price.

At its core, the BALANCE Model intends to promote the use of both GLP-1 medications and lifestyle interventions to help prevent chronic conditions and combat obesity, while also managing the costs of such medications for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and taxpayers.

Framework of the BALANCE Model

Similar to the recent Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing deals with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which expanded GLP-1 coverage for Medicare beneficiaries at a discounted monthly rate, the BALANCE Model builds on the Trump administration’s broader strategy to lower drug costs through direct manufacturer negotiations. However, the BALANCE Model takes the MFN pricing approach a step further by also expanding the use of lifestyle-focused preventative care initiatives.

In its December 23 announcement, CMS invited interested manufacturers to apply to opt into the BALANCE Model by responding to the Request for Applications (RFA) by January 8, 2026. States and Part D plan sponsors were also asked to submit a Notice of Intent to participate by the same date. Under the BALANCE Model, CMS will negotiate directly with GLP-1 manufacturers to reduce net prices, cap out-of-pocket costs, and standardize coverage criteria. CMS is also seeking commitments for manufacturer-provided lifestyle support services, such as fitness coaching and nutrition counseling, to supplement GLP-1 treatments and maintain long-term health.

The BALANCE Model will waive the current Part D coverage exclusion for weight-loss medications, meaning GLP-1s will be included in the basic benefit with set cost-sharing limits, aiming to increase accessibility and affordability. Participating plans will cover the negotiated drugs from participating manufacturers, and the manufacturers will provide rebates to keep prices aligned with negotiated terms. This structure integrates coverage, pricing, and access, targeting preventive care goals.

The BALANCE Model will also be open to all states participating in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). States that wish to participate were also asked to respond to the State RFA by January 8, 2026. Under State Medicaid coverage, price reductions will occur through supplemental rebate agreements between state agencies and manufacturers.

Action Plan and Timeline

The Model is set to launch in Medicaid programs as early as May 2026, and in Medicare Part D plans in January 2027. In the interim, CMS plans to implement a Medicare GLP-1 payment demonstration in July 2026. This demonstration will allow beneficiaries to obtain access to GLP-1 medications for $50 per month, so long as they meet the negotiated access criteria.

Beyond BALANCE: Two Other CMS Proposed Models for Part B and Part D Drugs

In addition to the BALANCE Model, CMS has introduced several other pricing initiatives that align with the Trump administration’s MFN drug pricing strategies, also aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs.

What's in the News

A U.S. appeals court temporarily paused a government order that would have required Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico to unwind their joint venture by January 1, putting on hold an action aimed at their coordination on scheduling, pricing, and capacity for U.S. Mexico routes.

Delta and Aeromexico have filed a legal challenge in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals against the U.S. Transportation Department order to dissolve their joint venture, seeking to maintain their current level of cooperation on cross border flights.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said the 6% air traffic cut tied to the recent government shutdown will end at 6 a.m. on Monday, although airlines including Delta have indicated it may still take several days for flight operations to return to more typical levels.

FAA related staffing shortages have recently led to flight delays and cancellations across major U.S. airports, affecting multiple carriers including Delta as the agency operated with reduced air traffic control capacity.

Delta Air Lines issued guidance for Q4 and fiscal 2025, indicating an expected total revenue year over year change for Q4 of up 2% to 4%, Q4 earnings per share in a range of US$1.60 to US$1.90, and full year 2025 earnings per share of about US$6.

How This Changes the Fair Value For Delta Air Lines

Fair Value Estimate: Adjusted slightly higher from US$73.64 to US$74.61, reflecting modestly updated modelling assumptions.

Discount Rate: Tweaked marginally lower from 9.19% to 9.18%, indicating a very small change in the required return used in the analysis.

Revenue Growth: Assumed long term growth rate moved slightly from 3.77% to 3.92%.

Net Profit Margin: Adjusted marginally from 7.16% to 7.14%, suggesting only a very small change in expected profitability levels.

Future P/E: Target future P/E multiple edged higher from 12.76x to 12.90x, a modest shift in how earnings are being valued in the model.

What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?","Gear up for Jan. 5 because today’s the day Wall Street and AI enthusiasts alike are eyeing as a potential catalyst event for Nvidia’s (NVDA) next chapter. After an explosive run that briefly made Nvidia the first company in the world to surpass a $5 trillion market cap, driven by surging demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips and datacenter hardware, the tech giant kicks off 2026 with a high-profile platform to shape the coming year’s narrative.

That’s when CEO Jensen Huang is expected to deliver an address at CES 2026, a stage where Nvidia has historically outlined strategic technology roadmaps and unveiled innovations that influence investor sentiment and industry direction. With demand for its advanced AI accelerators, geopolitical trade dynamics, and potentially lifting chip stocks, Jan. 5 could set the tone for Nvidia’s performance and investor expectations for the year ahead.

Wedbush analysts expect Jensen Huang to use his speech to lay out the company’s next-phase AI strategy, highlighting surging enterprise adoption as the AI revolution enters a new growth stage. The focus is likely to center on data centers, physical AI, robotics, and autonomous technologies, with updates on Nvidia’s Cosmos foundation model platform. Beyond AI infrastructure, Nvidia is also expected to unveil new developments across gaming, content creation and simulation.

About Nvidia Stock

Nvidia Corporation is a global leader in accelerated computing and AI, renowned for pioneering the graphics processing unit (GPU) that revolutionized gaming, data centers, and AI-driven computing. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, Nvidia’s technology now powers everything from high-performance gaming and cloud computing to autonomous vehicles and generative AI applications. With a market cap of roughly $4.6 trillion, Nvidia stands among the world’s most valuable companies, driven by its dominance in AI infrastructure and continued innovation in next-generation chip design.

In 2025, Nvidia’s share price experienced a noteworthy but volatile year. After opening the year significantly lower, the stock rallied on sustained demand for its AI hardware and datacenter solutions, driven by its leadership in the generative AI boom.

The 52-week low was around $86.62, reached in April 2025, while the 52-week high reached around $212.19, achieved in late October as the company hit record valuation milestones and investor optimism peaked.

That wide gulf between the high and low underscores how sentiment shifted throughout the year as Nvidia navigated geopolitical concerns, macroeconomic headwinds, and equally powerful AI demand tailwinds. The stock has overall delivered 31.6% returns over the past year.

Nvidia’s dominant position has led it to trade at a pronounced premium valuation compared to its industry peers, at 42.35 times forward earnings.

Strong Q3 Performance

Nvidia delivered a particularly strong showing in its third quarter of fiscal 2026 results that underscore just how deep the demand for AI infrastructure has become. On Nov. 19, the company reported revenue of a record $57 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 26, representing a 62% year-over-year (YOY) jump and a 22% increase from the prior quarter.

The company’s datacenter business was the main engine, with datacenter revenue hitting $51.2 billion, up 66% from a year ago, reflecting surging demand for AI-ready GPUs and cloud computing infrastructure. The firm’s profitability remained strong, with non-GAAP gross margins holding around 73.6% and the non-GAAP EPS at $1.30, a 60% YOY rise and comfortably ahead of Wall Street estimates.

Management also offered bullish forward guidance, expecting around $65 billion, plus or minus 2% in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026. That projection suggests confidence in continued strong demand for its AI chips and datacenter gear despite macroeconomic headwinds or geopolitical uncertainty.

Analysts tracking Nvidia project the company’s EPS to climb 51.2% YoY to $4.43 in fiscal 2026 and grow another 56.7% to $6.94 in fiscal 2027.

What Do Analysts Expect for Nvidia Stock?

Several Wall Street analysts have recently reaffirmed positive ratings on Nvidia stock in the wake of its strategic deal with AI chipmaker Groq, signaling continued confidence in the company’s growth prospects. Following the announcement of the approximately $20 billion non-exclusive licensing agreement and talent acquisition from Groq, analysts are showing renewed optimism.

Among others, Mizuho reiterated its “Outperform” rating and $245 price target on Nvidia following its deal with Groq, reinforcing bullish analyst sentiment. Mizuho views the transaction as a long-term positive that enhances Nvidia’s inferencing capabilities and supports its strong growth trajectory.

Also, Bernstein SocGen reiterated an “Outperform” rating and a $275 price target on Nvidia after its Groq technology deal.

Wall Street’s bullishness is evident in Nvidia having a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, 44 advise a “Strong Buy,” two suggest a “Moderate Buy,” one analyst is on the sidelines, giving it a “Hold” rating, and one offers a “Strong Sell” rating.

The average analyst price target for NVDA is $256, indicating a potential upside of 35.6%.

DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria upgraded CoreWeave to Neutral from Underperform and raised his price target to $68 from $36, triggering a rise of more than 4% in the stock.

The move drew attention partly because CoreWeave was already trading well above that level, changing hands at $79.32.

Upgrade driven by OpenAI funding prospects

Luria said his reassessment was linked to reports that OpenAI could pursue a fundraising round of up to $100 billion, a deal that, if completed, would improve visibility around CoreWeave’s large contracts with the AI developer.

“It shouldn’t be a foregone conclusion that OpenAI successfully completes its reported $100 billion potential fundraise, but if it does so, it would be able to fulfill all its commitments in 2026, including to CoreWeave,” Luria said in a note to clients.

CoreWeave signed a five-year contract worth $11.9 billion with OpenAI in March 2025 to provide cloud computing services, a deal that has been central to investor expectations for future revenue growth.

Despite the upgrade, Luria stressed that his fundamental concerns about the business had not disappeared.

He said that while a successful OpenAI fundraise could delay pressure on CoreWeave, it would not resolve deeper structural issues.

“While this would not change the value destruction inherent in CRWV’s business, it would kick the can down the road for the inevitable reckoning,” he said.

Debt concerns remain front and centre

Luria has been one of the most outspoken critics of CoreWeave, arguing that its model of taking on significant debt to build AI infrastructure for clients such as Microsoft and Nvidia is unsustainable.

He reiterated that view on Monday, warning that equity investors could still face heavy losses.

“We continue to believe that the equity in shares of CRWV may ultimately lose all its value since the entire value of the enterprise is owned by debt holders,” he said.

The analyst added that there was still a risk that a large portion of CoreWeave’s backlog may not be realised.

If OpenAI’s fundraising effort falls well short of the reported $100 billion target by the end of March, he warned, there could be “an acceleration of the collapse in the value of CRWV shares”.

Luria has previously said CoreWeave appears to be generating a return on capital of about 4%, well below an estimated cost of capital of 9%.

Broader analyst views

CoreWeave has countered such criticism by saying its contracts are designed to deliver risk-adjusted returns above its cost of capital and typically include fixed payments regardless of utilisation.

Other analysts expect margins to improve and borrowing costs to fall over time.

According to LSEG-compiled data, 17 of the 32 brokerages covering the stock rate it a buy or higher, while 13 recommend hold and two advise selling.

The median price target stands at $125.38.

The company went public in March in one of the most closely watched technology listings of the year, but its shares have been volatile as investors debate whether enthusiasm around artificial intelligence is becoming overheated.

Sentiment improved last month after CoreWeave was named as one of 24 partners in the US Department of Energy’s Genesis Mission, which aims to use AI to accelerate scientific discovery.

The stock also benefited from a bullish note last month by Citi Research analyst Tyler Radke, who resumed coverage after a restricted period.

Radke said management commentary suggested capacity expansion and bookings momentum were continuing into the fourth quarter, setting the stage for faster growth in 2026, even as the company works through supply constraints and power-related delays.

LAS VEGAS, 5 janvier 2026 – Cette année au CES 2026, L'Oréal Groupe, leader mondial de la beauté, a présenté deux technologies révolutionnaires qui exploitent la puissance de la lumière pour transformer les soins capillaires et cutanés : Light Straight + Multi-styler et LED Face Mask, toutes deux lauréates d’un CES 2026 Innovation Award.

« Chez L'Oréal, nous croyons depuis toujours que la beauté est profondément liée à la découverte scientifique, une conviction qui est au cœur de notre Groupe depuis plus de 115 ans. Aujourd’hui, c’est la combinatoire de nos avancées scientifiques et technologiques et de notre créativité qui nous permet de concevoir des expériences de beauté uniques, plus performantes et mieux adaptées aux besoins de chacune et chacun. Cette année, au CES 2026, notre connaissance scientifique et le développement de technologies LED propriétaires sur le marché illustrent une nouvelle fois notre engagement à repousser les limites des nouvelles solutions beauté », a déclaré Barbara Lavernos, Directrice Générale Adjointe en charge de la Recherche, de l'Innovation et de la Technologie chez L'Oréal Groupe.

L’Oréal présente Light Straight + Multi-styler

Depuis plus d’un siècle, le fer à lisser fait partie des accessoires incontournables de coiffage. Pourtant, les plaques chauffantes traditionnelles peuvent monter à 205 °C, dépassant largement le seuil à partir duquel la kératine commence à se dénaturer ayant pour conséquences de fragiliser la cuticule, d’augmenter la casse et d’atténuer la brillance des cheveux. C’est d’ailleurs une préoccupation majeure chez les consommateurs : selon une étude menée par L’Oréal auprès de consommatrices américaines en 2024, 58% des femmes interrogées déclarent que la chaleur est à l’origine de leurs cheveux abîmés.

Développé par la Recherche & l’Innovation de L'Oréal, Light Straight + Multi-styler utilise une technologie de lumière infrarouge* brevetée qui offre des résultats de coiffage exceptionnels tout en protégeant la santé des cheveux. Light Straight + Multi-styler est équipé de plaques en verre qui lissent efficacement les cheveux, sans jamais dépasser 160°C – soit une réduction significative de la température par rapport à la plupart des fers à lisser traditionnels. Selon des tests instrumentaux menés par L'Oréal, Light Straight + Multi-styler agit 3 fois plus vite et rend les cheveux 2 fois plus lisses que les lisseurs les plus hauts de gamme.

L'expérience utilisateur de Light Straight + Multi-styler repose sur une science et une ingénierie de haute précision. L'appareil utilise la lumière proche infrarouge, située juste au-delà du spectre visible, qui pénètre au cœur de la fibre capillaire. Cette solution remodèle les structures moléculaires qui déterminent la forme et la texture des cheveux tout en préservant leur intégrité et leur santé.

« Light Straight + Multi-styler fait passer le coiffage de la correction à la prévention. En limitant l’exposition répétée à la chaleur, nous contribuons à préserver l’intégrité du cheveu naturel dès le départ et permettons aux consommateurs de protéger leurs cheveux dans la durée. Nous pensons que cette innovation établit un nouveau standard en matière de coiffage de précision, non seulement en améliorant, mais en redéfinissant toute la catégorie du coiffage », a déclaré Guive Balooch, Vice-Président du Métier Beauté Augmentée et de l’Open Innovation chez L'Oréal et membre du Conseil des Leaders de l'Industrie de la Consumer Technology Association (CTA).

Parmi les avantages clés de Light Straight + Multi-styler :

Technologie infrarouge brevetée*: le design exclusif de l’appareil offre un rendu ultra-lisse et une meilleure tenue dans le temps.

Polyvalence multi-coiffure : en plus de lisser et d'adoucir les cheveux, Light Straight + Multi-styler peut être utilisé pour boucler les cheveux avec soin et précision, offrant une solution de coiffage multi-usage.

Résultats personnalisés : avec ses capteurs internes intelligents, ses algorithmes propriétaires intégrés et son apprentissage automatique, l'appareil s'adapte aux gestes de l'utilisateur pour optimiser l'expérience de chacun.

Avec AirLight Pro dévoilé au CES 2024, et dorénavant Light Straight + Multi-styler, L'Oréal déploie sa technologie de lumière infrarouge pour une routine de coiffage complète qui protège les cheveux.

Light Straight + Multi-styler devrait être lancé mondialement en 2027. Plus de détails, y compris les prix, seront disponibles sur loreal.com.

L'Oréal annonce le développement de LED Face Mask pour des soins ciblés de la peau

Poursuivant son engagement en matière d'innovations technologiques et de science de la longévité au service de la beauté, L’Oréal a également dévoilé son LED Face Mask, lauréat d'un CES 2026 Innovation Award. Développé avec I-Smart Developments, leader mondial de l'innovation en matière de dispositifs LED, ce masque flexible en silicone transparent et ultrafin – actuellement sous forme de prototype – diffuse la lumière directement sur le visage pour agir sur les signes de l’âge. Ce dispositif innovant intègre un microcircuit sans danger pour la peau, contrôlant avec précision l'émission de deux longueurs d'onde lumineuses spécifiques : la lumière rouge (630 nm) et la lumière proche infrarouge (830 nm). Chacune d’elles contribue à raffermir et lisser visiblement la peau tout en uniformisant le teint. Les tests en cours menés par L'Oréal viendront confirmer l’efficacité de la lumière rouge et proche infrarouge sur les ridules, le relâchement cutané ou encore l’irrégularité du teint.

Ce dispositif léger, portable et non invasif est conçu pour s'intégrer facilement aux routines de beauté quotidiennes, avec des sessions prédéfinies de 10 minutes.

LED Face Mask devrait être lancé en 2027*. Plus de détails, y compris les prix, seront disponibles sur loreal.com.

*Le lancement de LED Face Mask de L'Oréal Groupe aux États-Unis est soumis au processus de notification préalable de la FDA 510(k).

ID21,IBM,2026-01-05 15:44:01+00:00,www.nasdaq.com,October 16th Options Now Available For International Business Machines (IBM) - Nasdaq,BNK Invest,,,,,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/october-16th-options-now-available-international-business-machines-ibm,"Investors in International Business Machines Corp (Symbol: IBM) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 16th expiration.
At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IBM options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.
The put contract at the $295.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.60.
Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract.
For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.","Investors in International Business Machines Corp (Symbol: IBM) saw new options begin trading today, for the October 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 284 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At Stock Options Channel, our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the IBM options chain for the new October 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.

The put contract at the $295.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $295.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $266.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of IBM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $296.61/share today.

Because the $295.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the contract detail page for this contract. Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.69% return on the cash commitment, or 12.46% annualized — at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.

Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for International Business Machines Corp, and highlighting in green where the $295.00 strike is located relative to that history:

Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $305.00 strike price has a current bid of $29.95. If an investor was to purchase shares of IBM stock at the current price level of $296.61/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a ""covered call,"" they are committing to sell the stock at $305.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.93% if the stock gets called away at the October 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if IBM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for International Business Machines Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing IBM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $305.00 strike highlighted in red:

Considering the fact that the $305.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%. On our website under the contract detail page for this contract, Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.10% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.98% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.

The implied volatility in the put contract example is 32%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 33%.

Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 249 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $296.61) to be 30%. For more put and call options contract ideas worth looking at, visit StockOptionsChannel.com.

Safety Standardization Mandatory Code / Insurance Specification and Recommendation:

SKYX's Safety Code Standardization Team is receiving support from a new significant prominent leader with its government safety agency’s process for a safety mandatory standardization of its electrical ceiling outlet/receptacle technology.

SKYX’s code team is led by industry veterans Mark Earley, former head of the National Electrical Code (NEC), and Eric Jacobson, former President and CEO of the American Lighting Association (ALA). The Company’s safety Code Standardization team believes it will garner assistance from additional safety organizations with its code mandatory safety standardization efforts based on the product’s significant safety aspects. Mr. Earley and Mr. Jacobson were instrumental in numerous code and safety changes in both the electrical and lighting industries. Both strongly believe that, considering the Company’s standardization progress including its product specification approval voting for by ANSI / NEMA (American National Standardization Institute / National Electrical Manufacturers Association) and being voted into 10 segments in the NEC Code Book, it has met the necessary safety conditions for becoming a ceiling safety standardization requirement for homes and buildings.

With respect to insurance companies, the Company strongly believes its products can save insurance companies many billions of dollars annually by reducing fires, ladder falls, and electrocutions among other things. Management expects that once it completes an entire range and variations of its safe advanced plug & play products it will start being recommended by insurance companies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Management considers earnings (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, as adjusted, an important indicator in evaluating the Company’s business on a consistent basis across various periods. Due to the significance of non-recurring items, EBITDA, as adjusted, enables management to monitor and evaluate the business on a consistent basis. The Company uses EBITDA, as adjusted, as a primary measure, among others, to analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments and potential acquisitions. The Company believes that EBITDA, as adjusted, eliminates items that are not part of the Company’s core operations, such as interest expense and amortization expense associated with intangible assets, or items that do not involve a cash outlay, such as share-based payments and non-recurring items, such as transaction costs. EBITDA, as adjusted, should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, pre-tax income (loss), net income (loss) and cash flows used in operating activities. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements and is subject to inherent limitations. Investors should review the reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP financial measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.

After years of price increases, shoppers may start to see some signs of relief at the grocery store as food giants look to reignite growth.

Cheerios and Nature Valley bar maker General Mills said last month it cut prices on nearly two-thirds of its grocery products in North America, resulting in an uptick in product volume. PepsiCo also plans to lower prices this year across some of its food products as it looks to improve affordability.

Consumer inflation concerns have weighed heavilyon product volumes in recent quarters. PepsiCo noted in October that volumes for snacks in North America dipped 4%, while beverages slumped 3%. Other food manufacturers, such as Conagra Brands, Kraft Heinz and J.M. Smucker, posted declines in volumes.

“Consumers represent two-thirds of the economy,” said Brian Choi, a managing partner and CEO of The Food Institute. “They’re tapped out.”

Food-at-home prices are forecast to be up 2.3% in 2026, a slight improvement from last year,according to data from the USDA’s Economic Research Service. Despite the increases, they mark a sharp decline from the COVID-19 pandemic when inflation on food prices hit afour-decade high.

Much of the recent price increase has come from commodities such as coffee and ground beef, which are up 18.8% and 14.9%, respectively, during the last year, Labor Department statistics showed. Candy and chewing gum prices jumped 10.1%, and essentials such as bananas, lettuce and cereals are also all more expensive.

General Mills noted that high prices are pushing more shoppers to purchase food that is being discounted, particularly among consumers earning $100,000 or less.

PepsiCo, which is looking to lower prices as part of a turnaround plan, has an “opportunity to reinvest in value in a more substantial way,” Ramon Laguarta, the beverage and snacking company’s CEO, said in December.

“There’s a big reset of affordability because we see the consumer struggling in the U.S. and in many Western countries,”he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.

Despite some cuts, there are still categories where food makers are raising prices to offset inflationary pressures. Sweets maker Hershey in 2025 said it would put in place a double-digit percentage price increase due to elevated cocoa costs.

Executives noted in October that while cocoa prices have moderated, theyremain 70% above 2023 levels and are likely to increase in 2026. Hershey raised consumer costs to catch up to other competitors, noting the industry is less synchronized when it comes to pricing.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/xga7sYPwpobzO_wv_uc0R7JVncNTzJ_1ESn_Bv76t_I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9JTUdfMTgxMy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-05 11:15:20.777005

L’Oréal Groupe dévoile lors du CES 2026 deux nouvelles technologies qui mettent à profit la lumière infrarouge pour transformer les soins capillaires et cutanés : le Light Straight + Multi-styler et le LED Face Mask. « Chez L’Oréal, nous croyons depuis toujours que la beauté est profondément liée à la découverte scientifique, une conviction qui est au cœur de notre Groupe depuis plus de 115 ans. Cette année, au CES 2026, notre connaissance scientifique et le développement de technologies LED propriétaires sur le marché illustrent une nouvelle fois notre engagement à repousser les limites des nouvelles solutions beauté », déclare Barbara Lavernos, directrice générale adjointe en charge de la recherche, de l’innovation et de la technologie.

L’innovation du Light Straight + Multi-styler

À travers le temps, le fer à lisser est resté un outil incontournable pour le coiffage. Cependant, l’usage de plaques chauffantes qui montent jusqu’à 205 °C pose un problème de dégradation des cheveux. Une étude menée par L’Oréal en 2024 a révélé que 58 % des consommatrices américaines considèrent la chaleur comme la cause principale de l’endommagement de leur chevelure.

Pour répondre à cette problématique, L’Oréal a développé le Light Straight + Multi-styler. Cet outil intègre une technologie de lumière infrarouge brevetée, permettant de lisser les cheveux tout en réduisant la température à un maximum de 160 °C. Selon des tests instrumentaux, il agit trois fois plus rapidement que les fers à lisser traditionnels et rend les cheveux deux fois plus lisses.

La conception fignolée de l’appareil, qui utilise une lumière proche infrarouge, pénètre au cœur de la fibre capillaire, remaniant les structures moléculaires tout en préservant la santé des cheveux.« Light Straight + Multi-styler fait passer le coiffage de la correction à la prévention », ajoute Guive Balooch, vice-président du métier beauté augmentée et de l’open innovation. « Nous pensons que cette innovation établit un nouveau standard en matière de coiffage de précision », conclut-il.

Le masque LED, une nouvelle ère pour les soins de la peau

En parallèle, L’Oréal introduit le LED Face Mask. Ce masque, développé en partenariat avec iSmart, se veut flexible et léger, tout en diffusant la lumière pour agir sur les signes de l’âge. Equipé d’un microcircuit sans danger pour la peau, il émet deux longueurs d’onde lumineuses spécifiques : la lumière rouge (630 nm) et la lumière proche infrarouge (830 nm), favorisant le raffermissement et la lissage de la peau.",https://www.industries-cosmetiques.fr/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/capture-394-1024x587.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:29.720276

​With the physical structure all but finished and the opening weeks away, the company has submitted a request to the City of Ocala for a “State 3PS” alcohol permit.
The permit would allow the store to sell beer, wine, and liquor for off-premises consumption.
The application also indicates that the Ocala Police Department and Ocala Fire Rescue have reviewed the request and raised no objections.
Three other new Walmart locations are also planning to open their doors in January, including one in The Villages.","As a new Walmart Neighborhood Market in southeast Ocala nears completion ahead of its scheduled opening, the retailer is seeking city approval to sell beer, wine, and liquor at its new location.

During the Ocala City Council’s upcoming meeting on Tuesday, January 6, council members will consider a request from Wal-Mart Stores East, LP for the issuance of a location permit for the sale of beer, wine, and liquor at the company’s new store at 3535 SE Maricamp Road.

The new 47,914-square-foot building will feature approximately 166 parking spaces. The business will employ nearly 100 individuals.

Construction on the 47,914-square-foot grocery store is largely complete at Saddleback Square Shopping Center (formerly Cedar Shores). The new store, designated as Walmart #4245, is located at 3525 SE Maricamp Road.

​With the physical structure all but finished and the opening weeks away, the company has submitted a request to the City of Ocala for a “State 3PS” alcohol permit. The permit would allow the store to sell beer, wine, and liquor for off-premises consumption.

​According to the permit application, the store plans to sell alcohol between the hours of 7 a.m. and 2 a.m., Monday through Sunday, subject to city ordinances that limit Sunday sales hours.

​City staff have recommended approval of the request, noting that there are no schools, churches, or daycare centers within a 500-foot radius of the site. The application also indicates that the Ocala Police Department and Ocala Fire Rescue have reviewed the request and raised no objections. Police records show only three calls for service to the location in the past two years, all of which were self-initiated security checks.

​Once open, the new Neighborhood Market is expected to employ between 90 and 95 people. The site has been updated to provide 166 parking spaces—well above the city’s requirement of 47 spaces for a building of its size.

​The arrival of the new Walmart marks the culmination of a major redevelopment project for the shopping center, which had seen its anchor space sit vacant for nearly a decade before the former Winn-Dixie was demolished in 2024.

In late 2025, Walmart announced plans to launch four brand-new sites across Florida in early 2026, alongside remodels for dozens of existing stores to align with its modern “Store of the Future” concept.

The moves come from the firm’s latest note, headed by analyst Brent Thill, which urges investors to remain selective as “growth decelerates and lags versus other sectors like semis.”

Jefferies downgraded Adobe because “any contribution boost from AI has yet to show up,” noting that topline trends have been decelerating since fiscal 2023 and through Adobe’s fiscal 2026 guidance.

While the firm acknowledges that Adobe has made “significant progress with AI features since Firefly was announced in early 2023,” analysts argue that there is still “no AI inflection,” adding: “We do not see acceleration in total revs during our forecast period to FY30.”

Jefferies also cites investor concerns about long-term disruption to Adobe’s business model.

In contrast, Jefferies upgraded IBM to Buy, citing a clearer path to software momentum.

Thill says IBM is “rebooting software growth in ’26,” driven by Red Hat strength and synergies from recent and pending acquisitions, including HCP and Confluent.

The analyst writes that these deals “pave a clearer path to accelerated software growth,” while also enhancing IBM’s hybrid cloud and data capabilities.

Mainframe resilience and potential gains from generative AI monetisation through watsonx further support the upgrade, Jefferies says, arguing that operating leverage and synergy realisation should bolster margins and free cash flow heading into 2026.

Eli Lilly is a little expensive Eli Lilly's price advance over the past couple of years has pushed its valuation higher.
Eli Lilly isn't done yet To be fair, Eli Lilly is also working on new delivery methods for its GLP-1 drugs.
The real takeaway here is that Eli Lilly appears expensive today, with investors having priced in a significant amount of good news.
If you are concerned about the valuation of Eli Lilly, it may be prudent to take some profits.","Eli Lilly (LLY 3.41%) and Novo Nordisk (NVO +3.72%) are both highly respected pharmaceutical companies. However, their stock prices have traveled shockingly different paths over the past year or so, with Eli Lilly on the rise and Novo Nordisk falling sharply. Both price moves are the result of GLP-1 drugs. Has the good news played out for Eli Lilly?

What has happened with GLP-1 drugs?

Novo Nordisk was the first company to introduce GLP-1 drugs. This is a new category of drugs that helps people lose material amounts of weight very quickly. As long as patients continue to use the drug, the weight remains off. The drugs, currently delivered by needle, have been hailed as something of a miracle, especially for people who have had a hard time controlling their weight through diet and exercise alone.

There are negatives to GLP-1 drugs, including the fact that most patients who stop using the drugs gain back a lot of the lost weight. There's also the not-so-subtle fact that the weight loss involves both fat and muscle. Losing muscle is undesirable, particularly for older adults, as it increases the likelihood and negative impact of accidents, such as falls.

Still, customers are lining up to take GLP-1 drugs. Other pharmaceutical companies are also working hard on their own GLP-1 offerings. Eli Lilly came out with its version after Novo Nordisk, but it has quickly taken the lead in the new niche. It is now the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to GLP-1 shots. That's why Eli Lilly's stock has been performing well while Novo Nordisk's shares have been falling.

Eli Lilly is a little expensive

Eli Lilly's price advance over the past couple of years has pushed its valuation higher. While the price-to-earnings ratio is roughly in line with its five-year average, at around 53, it is not low on an absolute basis. For reference, the S&P 500's average P/E ratio is approximately 28, and the average technology stock, a sector known for being expensive, has a P/E of around 30. For an even more direct and stark comparison, the average P/E in the pharmaceutical sector is just under 10.

If you care at all about valuation, you should probably be asking yourself if it is time to sell Eli Lilly and lock in your profits. This is particularly relevant for Eli Lilly, as Novo Nordisk has recently introduced a new delivery method, a pill, for its GLP-1 drugs. Customers vastly prefer taking a pill to an injection, so this is a very big development. Novo Nordisk could regain some ground in the GLP-1 space after its pills start selling, likely in early 2026.

Given that Novo Nordisk's P/E ratio is around 15, about half of its five-year average P/E of 30, it appears more attractive from a valuation perspective. Its P/E is also far lower than Eli Lilly's P/E and much closer to the industry average. You might consider jumping into Novo Nordisk if you exit Eli Lilly. However, there's one small problem to consider here. The healthcare industry is driven by innovation, and new products are particularly important in the pharma segment of the industry.

Due to the significant costs associated with discovering and developing new drugs, pharmaceutical companies are granted the exclusive right to market and sell their new medications. But the patent protections are time-limited, so companies are always facing the day when those patents expire. Normally, this results in a patent cliff, which occurs when revenue from blockbuster drugs declines sharply due to the introduction of generic versions of the drugs. Even in the best-case scenario, a drug company has only a short window in which to generate huge profits.

However, the back and forth between Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly shows that patents alone aren't enough to protect a new drug. If a competitor introduces a more attractive drug that performs the same function, it will likely take the lead -- which is where another interesting alternative to Eli Lilly comes in, Pfizer (PFE 0.30%).

Pfizer dropped its own GLP-1 drug candidate, a significant setback. Meanwhile, several important drugs are set to lose their patent protections. The stock is deeply depressed, with a P/E ratio of just under 10. Investors appear to be very downbeat on the business right now.

However, Pfizer isn't sitting still. It recently acquired a company with a promising GLP-1 drug pipeline. And it agreed to distribute a Chinese company's GLP-1 drug if it gains regulatory approval. Given Wall Street's low expectations, Pfizer could be an interesting turnaround option in the drug sector and the GLP-1 race.

Eli Lilly isn't done yet

To be fair, Eli Lilly is also working on new delivery methods for its GLP-1 drugs. So, Novo Nordisk's pill could be a short-term benefit to the company, but it still may not change the long-term trends in the new drug niche. And there are clearly other companies working to topple both of the GLP-1 leaders, including Pfizer. The real takeaway here is that Eli Lilly appears expensive today, with investors having priced in a significant amount of good news.

Good news in the pharma sector tends to be short-lived, by design. If you are concerned about the valuation of Eli Lilly, it may be prudent to take some profits. You could buy Novo Nordisk, but an even better value play could be Pfizer, which investors appear to be treating as an industry also-ran. Yet Pfizer is just as capable as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in finding, developing, and marketing new drugs. History suggests that value-priced Pfizer will eventually turn its business around with its own innovation.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849185%2F25_03_14-a-person-with-their-hands-up-in-frustration-_mf-dload-gettyimages-1306802194-1200x711-5fd5365.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:02.514359

The quiet invasion

2025 came in low, didn’t kick in the door. Didn’t scream ‘new world’, didn’t settle a score. No revolution speech, no dramatic ignition. Quickly, quietly changing the room, while we sat in position. It wasn’t a scene from a movie, nay no robots in the street. Just a shift in rhythm, a change in beat. AI didn’t knock, didn’t wait for its turn. Didn’t ask the boardroom what it’s allowed to learn. It slid into the walls, into the processes, into the pace. Into how work moves, decides and accelerates. Embedded in the drywall, living in the code. Rewriting rules of our heavy workload.

Zoom out wide, watch the skyline bend. When scale started folding, it wasn’t about a trend. It was heavy systems learning how to move light. Overlap costs more than the value of size, right? Brands felt the squeeze, yeah, every channel pulled. Every platform claimed it’s the place where you ruled. Too many voices, and not enough core. Consolidation wasn’t fear, it’s physics at play. Gravity speaking in a very clear way.

The engine room

Take it back to the engine room, where the real shift stayed. This wasn’t better tools; it was how work gets made. We talk about speed but look at the chain. Agent speaks to agent, creating new brains. Work now moves faster than your coffee can cool. Decisions are being learnt, while we’re choosing tools. Agentic AI. Don’t soften the phrase, It’s not a helper on call for the lazy days. It’s momentum in play; it’s the gear and the clutch. Not just automation of tasks that you used to touch. But systems deciding what happens next too. The friction is gone; the view is brand new.

The shadow of silence

And here’s what we whisper, not what we say loud. When friction disappears, fear gathers a crowd. Because speed feels like replacement when roles feel thin. When you don’t know where you add weight within. Let’s be clear – AI doesn’t eliminate people, that’s not the crime, Confusion does. Silence does. Neglect over time. Ignoring the human while upgrading the brain is how intelligence quietly turns into strain. Automation isn’t free, it just moves the bill. From hours to outcomes. From doing the work to deciding what’s right. So, people matter more, not less, not reduced. Agents can act, but they can’t choose the truth.

The cost and the cut

Here’s where the people cost enters sharp and clean. Where spreadsheets pretend that humans are screens. Margins tighten up. Finance circles the room. AI looks like relief. Cuts feel like a broom. But cut without thinking and you sever the spine. Amputate futures just to feel fine? For a quarter in time, you lose the long game. People cost isn’t expense – uh, uh – that’s a rookie name. It’s stored return. It’s the bank vault door. Unrealised potential waiting for more. Don’t reskill them? The gaps show fast. Don’t upskill them? The systems run past. Don’t mentor them? Relevance dies. Flattened by workflows they’ll never learned to guide.

The operating system

Training isn’t a programme you tick and forget; it’s an operating system you constantly set. Not videos watched at 1.5x on a screen, But how to lead systems you didn’t build, but you mean to mean. Teach how agents work, where the bias creeps in. How to question the output before damage begins. How to push creatively, not blindly comply. How to say, ‘technically right, but emotionally dry’. Because emotion isn’t noise, it’s market signal. Brands live in feeling, not logical ritual. No agent understands pride, shame, fear, or hope. Like a human who’s lived and learned how to cope.

The strategy

So here is the math you cannot ignore, The only investment that settles the score: Mentorship becomes insurance. Training becomes retention. Empathy becomes performance.

AI won’t replace the workforce whole. But people who evolve will replace static roles. More jobs will come, but not the same shape. Hybrid minds setting the new escape. Leadership splits clean as the pressure grows. Those who step up. Those who master this new prose. You can automate output, automate scale. But care doesn’t code and culture won’t jailbreak.

Here’s the close, no padding, no spin: Efficiency will be cheap, it’ll be the price of admission. Advantage would be the culture, the soul and the mission. AI won’t decide who stays in the game. Markets will. Clients will. Talent will name. They’ll see who built muscle, and who cut the bone, Who treated their people as the throne, not the stone. In 2026, the machine will be the means. People will be the strategy. Mic drop.",https://campaignme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Tahaab-Rais-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 13:01:38.719608

In reality, especially across the Middle East they could be the best tandem since oxygen and fire. When aligned, they don’t cancel each other out. They ignite growth, connection and long-term brand value.

And this isn’t limited to consumer brands. Some of the most exciting progress is happening in the business-to-businsess (B2B) segment, where sustainability can be a strong commercial driver. A standout example from the Middle East is ‘Move to -15’ by DP World, a UAE-based campaign rallying shipping companies and freight partners to cut emissions by 15 per cent. It reframed sustainability from a compliance burden into a competitive advantage.

Purpose that pays: Data-driven proof

According to Brand Finance’s 2025 Sustainability Perceptions Index (SPI), sustainability now drives a meaningful share of consumer demand. In categories such as automotive, discretionary fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), professional services and luxury, sustainability perceptions influence between 4 per cent and 23 per cent of demand – making it one of the most powerful commercial drivers in any brand toolkit.

WARC’s analysis of a decade of its Effective 100 reinforces the same story: one in four of the world’s most effective campaigns used environment or social purpose as a central theme. Brands that engage people with meaningful issues don’t lose commercial impact – they multiply it. The evidence is clear: sustainability isn’t a cost. It’s an accelerant.

A ‘MINI MBA’ BRINGING CMOS & CSOS TOGETHER

The International Advertising Association, together with sustainable marketing pioneer Thomas Kolster is launching a new mini-MBA programme, which brings chief marketing officers (CMOs) and chief sustainability officers (CSOs) together.

The programme is taught by leading CMOs and CSOs from brands such as P&G and Tony’s Chocolonely.

Why the Middle East is primed for this partnership

The region is in the midst of rapid economic, generational and cultural change. Young populations, rising environmental awareness and fast-evolving consumer expectations create fertile ground for purpose-fuelled growth.

People in the Middle East don’t want moral lectures. They want better choices: cleaner cities, healthier food, smarter mobility and stronger futures. Every year, I witness better and more meaningful work coming from the region, which is also reflected in the WARC research.

This is where marketing and sustainability complement each other perfectly. Sustainability brings the substance. Marketing brings the spark. When the two align, they transform complex topics into human stories: progress over perfection, empowerment over guilt and innovation over sacrifice.

What it looks like when it works

Authentic storytelling backed by credible action: SPI shows that brands lose billions in value when perception and performance don’t align. Marketing cannot fix an empty sustainability story, but it can amplify a real one.

Campaigns that connect emotionally, not morally: WARC’s most effective purpose campaigns didn’t preach. They made people feel something and made sustainability relevant to everyday life. That approach resonates strongly across the Middle East, where emotional storytelling and cultural nuance matter more than corporate jargon.

Positioning sustainability as value, not sacrifice: When sustainability is framed as smarter, healthier and more aspirational living, people lean in. When it’s framed as a restriction, they tune out. Marketing’s job is to translate environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks into benefits people can actually see, taste, feel and enjoy.

A positive call – not for perfection, but for partnership

Sustainability doesn’t succeed through moral superiority; it succeeds through collaboration. Through building trust, not fear. If sustainability is oxygen, marketing is the fire – one provides the fuel, the other sets it alight.

The future belongs to brands that realise the two aren’t rivals but co-architects of value. The Middle East has everything it needs to lead this shift: ambition, innovation, young talent, and a consumer base hungry for brands that matter.

The moment we stop seeing marketing and sustainability as opposing forces, we unlock the most powerful growth engine of the next decade: purpose-driven brands that are both commercially sharp and culturally relevant.",https://campaignme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/thomas-loster.png,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:29.473916

Kepler also has direct connections to a set of pre-processed information, including an internal data knowledge base and an internal documents service.
Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP), invented by Anthropic, has been “so helpful” for Kepler, Xu said.
Nonetheless, running an agent-based internal data analysis tool seems to bring a lot of value to the company.","For OpenAI employees, asking a question even as seemingly simple as how many ChatGPT Pro users it has in one particular country can be surprisingly difficult, given that the needed data may be stretched be across multiple data sources, each of which is accessible in a slightly different way.

Overall, OpenAI has 70,000 different data sets, amassing 600PBs of new data daily. About 3,500 employees can access this data, using any 1 of 15 tools. The company has always kept close count of its users, but as it adds more regions and plans and features, tallying numbers becomes more difficult.

But each new query brought its own challenges. So analysts frequently found themselves in extended Slack conversations or even meetings with their peers just to figure out how to access the data.

“Simple questions shouldn’t be this difficult, or time consuming,” said Bonnie Xu, OpenAI technical staff member on the data productivity team, during a talk at QCON AI conference, held in New York last month.

Xu was there to discuss a tool the company created, called Kepler, to streamline this process.

Kepler is a helpful agent designed to answers questions for OpenAI employees, hiding the sometimes-many tasks it must undertake to find the answer.

Originally, Kepler was designed primarily for the data scientists at the company, but since its launch the user base has expanded to other personal in finance, human resources and other departments.

One Kepler user, according to Xu, actually said it was the closest they’ve experienced an AI system come to AGI.

OpenAI’s Challenges in Internal Data Retrieval

For the business analyst, many of the database tables might appear very similar. One database may include logged-out users, while another does not. Some tables included encrypted users, while others do not and must have that data joined into the resulting dataset. Which one to use?

Writing the correct SQL code to extract the data can be difficult as well, especially if they involve joins across different tables.

“Missing one nuance can lead to an answer that is wrong by an order of magnitude, and this can be catastrophic when making important business decisions,” Xu said.

Kepler in Action

Built in-house, Kepler is a data analyst, one that can tap all of OpenAI’s internal data stores to answer questions. OpenAI employees can interface with Kepler through Slack or through an IDE, such as Cursor, or by integration with a specific workflow, or by mobile or other remote clients. In the background, Kepler uses GPT-5 to parse the request.

To provide an example of how Kepler works, Xu walked through a question about New York taxi travels times, She wanted to know which times during the day have the most variance in travel times, as well as which journeys are the “most unreliable,” meaning location pairs (origin and destination) where the variance between the shortest and longest travel times is the greatest.

The demo showed the “chain of thought,” or a series of evaluations and actions, that Kepler executed to answer this question.

First, it does an internal knowledge search, identifying two potentially relevant datasets, including a 2016 collection of NYC travel time data for taxis, which included pick up and drop off times, and the zip codes of both the destination and departure locations.

The agent then calculated the median time for each zip code, identifying the 95th and 99th percentiles. The agent makes educated guesses on how to write the appropriate queries to get the needed information, testing each one, and soon finds one that works.

“You can imagine, doing this manually yourself takes a lot of time, but the agent is just going through these query and result steps on your behalf,” Xu said. When the queries appear to be correct, it sorts the results, then does some light formatting and even prepares a chart to present the data to the user. (The answers showed that rush hours and late nights are the most unreliable times.)

Another demo Xu provided showed Kepler working through a question of why there was a big spike in ChatGPT users in March 2025. It consulted a dashboard and a mission document to find the table that displayed this data. Kepler wrote different queries to try to pinpoint the sudden increase in usage, such as querying by region. It looked for errors, such as log data duplication.

The chain-of-thought identified a possible reason, namely the launch of a new generative image feature. They did a web search to cross-reference the hypothesis, finding the release notes and news articles on the launch.

Kepler stores all the questions, so you can pick up follow-up threads later on. When asked a follow-up question about taxi rides on February 14, Valentine’s Day, shows that the agent knows which tables and queries to use.

You can also interrupt Kepler if you see from its chain of thought that it is going in the wrong direction.

And since analysts tend to ask the same type of questions, such as product analysis and data validation, Kepler keeps sets of custom workflows for these sorts of questions

How Kepler Works

At its core, Kepler is a set of APIs that communicate directly with ChatGPT (currently version 5). Kepler also has direct connections to a set of pre-processed information, including an internal data knowledge base and an internal documents service. It can also make calls to data warehouses and other data services running on Apache Spark, Airflow and other platforms.

Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP), invented by Anthropic, has been “so helpful” for Kepler, Xu said. Kepler uses the internal documents to understand how to query databases or perform other tasks on MCP. If the results didn’t come out as expected, it can then rerun the query with slight modifications. In effect, the Kepler agent is reasoning by itself.

“So instead of you giving the feedback, Kepler is running tools, then using the right tools to take the next set of steps, depending on whatever feedback that’s given,” Xu said.

Typically, agents running on their own can return wildly inaccurate results, but with additional context in hand, they can understand when something is wrong and try to vary their approach.

“So the really lovely thing is that Kepler can interactively explore the data itself, and content is carried over the whole time,” she said.

The Importance of Metadata

Also helping build out the context is the metadata.

“It’s not enough to look at the table by itself, just as it is. You need to understand how the table was created and where it came from,” Xu said. This is the secret to the agent really understanding the differences between tables.

An offline job is run to compile this information about each table.

Much of this data has already been compiled by the company. Rich metadata about each database table has been captured, such as why it was created and what it is being used for, and even what its primary keys are.

It also uses codex generation to build out metadata from the code itself.

“Since this is all refreshed periodically by an offline job, the context stays fresh without any manual involvement.”

If Kepler, or a user, finds an error, it saves the correction in memory.

“For us, memory is really the mechanism that helps the agent continuously learn and improve,” Xu said. “Contacts will get you maybe 80 – 90% of the way there. But sometimes you need those final little corrections that are really hard to just infer.”

To evaluate the quality of the answers, OpenAI runs an Eval Grader, which offers a score for each answer tested. It looks at how the delivered results differ from the expected or correct results.

In many cases, a correct answer may have a slightly different SQL query than what was expected, but the development team plans for this.

“When we compare resolve tests, we actually give a little wiggle room with things that don’t meaningfully impact the answer,” Xu said.

Users bring their own credentials to Kepler, thus ensuring they don’t see any data that they don’t have permission to see.

Future Steps for Kepler

At present, OpenAI has no plans to open source Kepler or offer it as an enterprise product, Xu said, noting that she isn’t in the position to make these decisions.

Nonetheless, running an agent-based internal data analysis tool seems to bring a lot of value to the company.

“I think at least from what we’ve heard from our users, directly using Kepler is a lot faster. It’s more productive, just because when you’re looking at different sources, that’s a lot of stuff you have to do, and you have to connect the dots,” Xu said. “Kepler is really that layer on top, that abstraction that does it for you.”

The EPA had originally said it expected to finalise the RVO rules before the statutory deadline of 30 November 2025.
Once finalised, the RVO rule will determine blending obligations and compliance deadlines for biofuel producers and refiners in 2026 and 2027.","The EPA’s filing came in response to an 8 December order directing the agency to provide an update on its progress and timeline for establishing RVO mandates for the next two years, the 16 December report said.

According to the filing, the delayed response was due to pending multiple interagency reviews and consultations.

The order stemmed from ongoing litigation brought by HF Sinclair Refining & Marketing, HF Sinclair Parco Refining and Alon Refining Krotz Springs, challenging the EPA’s August decision to deny their small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions for 2024 compliance, the report said.

In June, the EPA released a proposed rule, referred to as “Set 2”, for 2026 and 2027. The proposal also aimed to limit imported biofuels and feedstocks, eliminate electricity from the RFS programme, and reduce the 2025 cellulosic RVO, while setting higher biodiesel blending targets, S&P Global wrote.

Market participants are waiting for further guidance on the 45Z tax credit and the RVO finalisation, as both policies play a key role in biofuels margins, according to the report.

Industry participants have said delays add near-term uncertainty for RIN values and blending economics, particularly as refiners assess compliance strategies for 2026.

A public comment period closed in August, followed by a supplemental proposal in September that explored reallocating volumes waived under the small refinery exemption programme, the report said.

The EPA had originally said it expected to finalise the RVO rules before the statutory deadline of 30 November 2025.

In its 15 December filing, the EPA said it was working to finalise the standards, noting that more than 2,000 public comments had been submitted.

It was coordinating with other federal agencies and addressing technical issues, including a regulatory impact analysis of the proposed volumes, the report said.

Once finalised, the RVO rule will determine blending obligations and compliance deadlines for biofuel producers and refiners in 2026 and 2027.

The 2025 RVO will expire on 31 January 2026, unless the EPA finalises the 2026 obligations earlier, in which case compliance deadlines would roll forward; otherwise, statutory deadlines would be moved forward to 1 June 2026, according to the EPA.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/US-biodiesel-Adobe-Stock-sized.jpg?mtime=1715763295,N,,2026-01-05 10:02:26.938746

An increasing number of American boys and young men are “t-maxxing” — taking testosterone when they don’t have a medical reason.

Under the “Reactive” column (S1), Row 1 is Prompt (Pr), Row 2 is Function Call (Fc), and Row 3 is Agent (Ag).
The emergent row (Row 4) highlights areas where the field is currently innovating rapidly, such as Multi-agent systems (Ma) and Synthetic data (Sy).","Martin Keen, a Master Inventor at IBM, recently introduced a compelling conceptual framework for understanding the rapidly expanding universe of Artificial Intelligence components: the AI Periodic Table. Keen spoke with IBM Tech about this structure, designed to map concepts like LLMs, RAG, and AI agent frameworks into a clear, organized taxonomy, much like the elements of chemistry. This approach is vital because, as Keen noted, “What if the world of AI felt a bit like this to you? A thousand terms flying around, everyone’s talking about agents and RAG and embeddings…” The immediate utility of this table is providing a stable, predictable reaction structure to the chaos of modern AI terminology.

The structure Keen presented organizes AI components across two axes: rows representing the stage of maturity or development, and columns representing functional groupings. The rows are categorized as: Row 1: Primitives (the foundational elements), Row 2: Compositions (how primitives are combined), Row 3: Deployment (elements critical for production systems), and Row 4: Emerging (nascent concepts). The columns delineate primary functional families: Group 1: Reactive (S1), Group 2: Retrieval (S2), Group 3: Orchestration (S3), Group 4: Validation (S4), and Group 5: Models (S5).

The core insight here is that AI architectures are not random but follow predictable patterns of combination, much like chemical bonding. For instance, the most fundamental reactive primitive is the Prompt (Pr), which dictates instructions to an AI. This element sits at the intersection of the “Reactive” family and the “Primitives” row.

Keen explicitly mapped the core building blocks of contemporary AI systems onto this grid. Under the “Reactive” column (S1), Row 1 is Prompt (Pr), Row 2 is Function Call (Fc), and Row 3 is Agent (Ag). The “Retrieval” column (S2) features Embeddings (Em) as the primitive, Vector databases (Vx) as the composition, and Finetuning (Ft) for deployment readiness. This organization immediately clarifies dependencies; for example, RAG (Rg) is clearly a composition of Retrieval (Em) and Orchestration (Rg).

A key principle underpinning this table is reactivity versus inertness. Keen observed that some elements, like Prompts, are highly reactive: “Because prompts are reactive, you change one word in your prompt, while you’re going to get a completely different output.” Conversely, elements in the Models column (S5), such as the Large Language Model (Lg/LLM), are more like noble gases—stable and foundational.

The framework elegantly situates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as a composition (Row 2) combining Embeddings (Em) from the Retrieval column (S2) with the Orchestration (Rg) column (S3). This positioning underscores that RAG is not a standalone primitive but a deliberate assembly of existing components to ground LLM outputs in specific, verifiable data.

The emergent row (Row 4) highlights areas where the field is currently innovating rapidly, such as Multi-agent systems (Ma) and Synthetic data (Sy). These are not yet fully standardized deployment components but represent the next wave of complexity and capability. For venture capitalists and founders, this table serves as an immediate diagnostic tool. When evaluating a new AI product, one can quickly identify which “elements” it utilizes and how they are combined, revealing the system’s sophistication and reliance on established versus cutting-edge techniques.

The explicit mapping of these concepts clarifies the relationships that often baffle newcomers. For instance, the Agent (Ag) primitive in Row 3, Deployment, is shown looping back to the Prompt (Pr) primitive, illustrating the Agent’s ability to generate its own reasoning steps and prompts iteratively. This visual representation transforms a confusing array of buzzwords into a coherent, navigable architectural map.",https://www.startuphub.ai/wp-content/uploads/ai-periodic-table-1024x576.webp,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:19.030508

The FTC finalized a consent order against Illusory Systems Inc. d/b/a Nomad, a provider of customer relationship management software, following allegations that the company failed to implement basic security measures, which ultimately allowed hackers to access and siphon $186 million in customer funds. According to the FTC’s press release, the Commission’s complaint alleges violations of Section 5 of the FTC Act based on deceptive and unfair practices related to the company’s data security representations. In addition to requiring Illusory Systems to return money stolen by hackers, the order mandates that the company establish a comprehensive information security program and submit to regular third-party assessments.

Bureau of Competition; Competition; Nonmerger; Noncompete

The FTC has announced a new date for its public workshop on noncompete agreements, now set for January 27, 2026, at the FTC’s Headquarters. According to the FTC’s press release, the workshop will explore the use of noncompete clauses in employment contracts and examine their effects on worker mobility and competition in labor markets. The event will feature perspectives from researchers, industry representatives, employee advocates, and other stakeholders as the Commission continues to study potential enforcement and policy actions under Section 5 of the FTC Act.

The FTC has reached a settlement with Instacart to resolve allegations that the company misled consumers regarding its tipping practices for delivery workers. According to the FTC’s press release, the Commission alleged that Instacart’s representations led consumers to believe their entire tip would go to workers, when in fact Instacart retained a portion for itself, in violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act. Under the terms of the settlement, Instacart will provide $60 million in refunds to affected consumers and is required to change its disclosures about how tips are distributed. Beyond the refund, the settlement order prohibits Instacart from making misrepresentations about the costs of its delivery services and satisfaction guarantees. Additionally, Instacart is instructed to clearly and conspicuously disclose the terms, and obtain express informed consent from consumers, for any subscription transactions that involve automatic charges unless the consumer actively opts out.

The FTC took enforcement action against Adamas Amenity Services LLC, a building services contractor, and its affiliated businesses for allegedly participating in unlawful no-hire agreements that restricted the recruitment and hiring of certain employees. As described in the FTC’s press release, the Commission alleges that the companies entered into no-hire agreements to restrict other building owners and management companies across New Jersey and New York City to hire Adamas employees—mainly workers performing janitorial, front desk, security, and other services—without incurring a large penalty. According to the complaint, these arrangements diminished competition in labor markets, limited employment opportunities, and potentially suppressed wages—conduct that purportedly violates Section 5 of the FTC Act. As part of the order, Adamas is barred from the use of these no-hire agreements, must notify employees affected by past no-hire agreements, and must post clear and conspicuous notice that employees are no longer subject to no-hire agreements. This action underscores the Commission’s ongoing focus on labor market competition and worker mobility.",https://images.bannerbear.com/direct/y0aJ23zRDdqMxX4OGl/requests/000/122/997/480/PwAV5rMNq6OxNw3PQkBm274Op/5c5fbbd0194016bec9a43e1c82df459d9053c8be.png,N,,2026-01-05 11:05:22.291710

On January 5, Jefferies adopted a more cautious stance on Adobe, reducing its rating and cutting the price target from $500 to $400.
Analysts cited a strategic realignment across the sector as the core reason: The firm anticipates a deceleration in software sector growth by 2026.
At the recent price of $333.30, Adobe trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6.
However, current trading is being driven more by sector rotation and technical trends than by such valuation models.","Adobe's stock is encountering significant headwinds following a major rating downgrade by the investment firm Jefferies. The bank has shifted its recommendation from ""Buy"" to ""Hold,"" concurrently slashing its price target substantially. This move comes as technical indicators for the stock deteriorate, even though its valuation appears attractive in a historical and sector-wide context. The situation raises questions about a potential broad re-rating of the software industry.

On January 5, Jefferies adopted a more cautious stance on Adobe, reducing its rating and cutting the price target from $500 to $400. Analysts cited a strategic realignment across the sector as the core reason:

The firm anticipates a deceleration in software sector growth by 2026.

Other technology segments, such as semiconductors, are now viewed as more attractive investment opportunities.

The monetization of Adobe's artificial intelligence features is progressing more slowly than previously forecast.

Consequently, Jefferies advises an underweight position in software equities for the first half of 2026, favoring infrastructure investments instead.

Diverging Views on Financial Prospects

Research firms present conflicting outlooks regarding Adobe's earnings trajectory, highlighting market uncertainty:

Jefferies (January 5): Downgraded to ""Hold,"" citing sluggish AI revenue conversion and broader sector headwinds.

Zacks Research (December 31): Raised its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Adobe. The Q1 2026 forecast was lifted to $4.80 per share, with the full-year 2026 expectation increased to $19.00.

This juxtaposition of rising profit estimates and falling price targets underscores the current debate over appropriate valuation levels and multiple expansion.

Technical Picture Turns Bearish

The market's reaction has exacerbated an already weak technical setup. The stock recently traded around $333.30, marking a notable decline from recent sessions.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

The share price has fallen below its 8-, 50-, and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs).

Analysis platforms currently classify the trend as ""strongly bearish.""

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits near 39, indicating sustained downward pressure, though it is approaching oversold territory.

In the short term, momentum and trend-following signals are dominating market perception.

Valuation Contrasts with Prevailing Mood

From a fundamental perspective, a different narrative emerges. At the recent price of $333.30, Adobe trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.6.

This compares to a sector average P/E of 31.7.

Direct competitors command an average P/E multiple of approximately 56.

Financial models from Simply Wall St., using a discounted cash flow approach, suggest a fair value of $521.39 per share. Theoretically, this implies the stock could be undervalued by more than 30%. However, current trading is being driven more by sector rotation and technical trends than by such valuation models.

Institutional Activity Shows Mixed Signals

Recent regulatory filings reveal divergent moves among major investors during the third quarter of 2025. Davis Capital Management established a new position, acquiring approximately 4,009 shares. In contrast, Miracle Mile Advisors reduced its holdings by 56.7% in the same period.

Overall, institutional investors currently hold about 81.79% of Adobe's outstanding shares, meaning professional market participants continue to exert a strong influence on price discovery.

With the stock near $333 and Jefferies' new $400 target, the market is now testing whether the relatively low valuation will provide meaningful support or if the negative sector trend will push shares further toward their 52-week lows.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2423322_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:04:51.727668

The ranking is based on integrators’ cumulative installed and contracted capacity worldwide, measured in MW terms, as of July 31, 2025. Notably, Trina Storage also secured Top 10 positions across multiple key regional markets, including Europe, the Middle East & Africa (MEA), Australia, and other major markets worldwide, underscoring the company’s strong global footprint and broad-based regional strength.

The recognition from S&P Global Energy highlights Trina Storage’s ability to execute utility-scale projects reliably across diverse markets, supported by strong system integration capabilities and a robust global project pipeline, underscoring its long-term competitiveness within the global energy storage industry.

Integrated Capabilities Built for Global Markets

As a global energy storage system integrator, Trina Storage remains committed to delivering high-value, safe, and reliable energy storage solutions through continuous innovation and global execution. Leveraging Trinasolar’s extensive experience in the photovoltaic sector and its worldwide presence, Trina Storage has established end-to-end integration capabilities, spanning core components, system design, project delivery, and intelligent operation and maintenance.

Through a combination of system engineering expertise and standardized, modular product design, Trina Storage is able to adapt flexibly to varying grid requirements and application scenarios across global markets, supporting reliable performance and long-term economic value for utility-scale projects.

Global Track Record Across Key Regions

These integrated capabilities have translated into a growing portfolio of landmark projects across Asia-Pacific, Latin America, North America, Europe, and the Middle East & Africa, including deployments in complex and challenging environments such as deserts, high-altitude regions, and island grids, while maintaining strong localization and long-term operational stability.

North America: Trina Storage has expanded its strategic partnership with Lightshift Energy, with both parties committed to jointly delivering over 1 GWh of energy storage projects in the coming years.

Latin America: The company achieved a milestone with the shipment of a 1.2 GWh single-site energy storage project in Chile, setting a regional benchmark.

Middle East & Africa: The Abydos 500 MWh solar-plus-storage project in Egypt, delivered by Trina Storage, was successfully grid-connected in July this year and stands as one of the largest single-site hybrid projects in Africa.

Asia-Pacific (excluding China): Utility-scale projects under construction have surpassed 2.4 GWh, spanning key markets such as Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.

Strong Growth Momentum and Global Service Network

With its global delivery capabilities continuing to expand, Trina Storage expects its annual shipments to double in 2025, reaching approximately 8 GWh, with shipment targets planned to nearly double again in the following year. In parallel, the company has already secured over 10 GWh of overseas orders, most of which are scheduled for delivery between 2025 and 2026.

Supporting this growth is a customer-centric global service framework covering the full project lifecycle. Trina Storage operates an extensive operations and maintenance network across more than 180 countries, supported by over 100 spare parts hubs worldwide, providing lifecycle services from early-stage project support through long-term operation.

“This recognition from S&P Global highlights Trina Storage’s strengths in technology innovation, global delivery, and sustainable development.” said Mr. Yang Bao, President of Energy Storage Division at Trinasolar. “We will continue to serve diverse market needs worldwide with safer, higher-performance energy storage solutions, supporting the evolution of next-generation power systems and the global energy transition.”

Looking Ahead

Being ranked among S&P Global Energy’s Top 10 energy storage system integrators globally, and achieving leading positions across multiple regions, reflects market confidence in Trina Storage’s system integration expertise and large-scale delivery capability. The company will continue to advance innovation and deepen its global presence, supporting the large-scale deployment of energy storage and the transition toward a more sustainable energy future.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-12-11%2Fceejc6h3%2Ftrinastorage-logo-resize?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:38.151415

Investors are weighing this price in relation to its current earnings profile and broader pharmaceutical portfolio.

Recent trading has been relatively steady, but a 30 day share price return of 6.93% and a 90 day share price return of 28.06% sit alongside a 1 year total shareholder return of 42.26% and a very large 5 year total shareholder return. This combination suggests that momentum has been building over time as investors reassess growth prospects and risk.

If Eli Lilly has caught your eye, this could be a moment to see how it lines up against other that might fit a similar role in your portfolio.

With Eli Lilly trading near its recent highs and showing an intrinsic discount estimate alongside only a small gap to its analyst price target, the key question is whether the stock is undervalued or if the market is already pricing in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.2% Undervalued

Compared with Eli Lilly's last close at $1,080.36, the narrative fair value of $1,189.18 points to a higher price that the author views as justified.

Catalysts

• Mounjaro/Zepbound: Lilly’s tirzepatide franchise is the engine of growth. Mounjaro (for type 2 diabetes) and Zepbound (obesity) each grew rapidly in 2024. Analysts project Mounjaro sales of $18.4 B in 2025 and $22.8B in 2026, and Zepbound jumping from $4.9B (2024) to $12.5 B in 2025 (and $18.1B in 2026). In other words, Lilly’s tirzepatide sales are expected to surpass Novo’s by 2026.

Curious what kind of revenue run rate and profit margin could support that price, and what future earnings multiple the narrative leans on? The assumptions behind this fair value knit together aggressive GLP 1 volume expectations, premium pricing, and a profit profile more often linked with high growth sectors. Want to see exactly how those building blocks add up to that valuation target?

Result: Fair Value of $1,189.18 (UNDERVALUED)

However, there is still real risk that high GLP 1 pricing faces pushback, or that safety concerns, lawsuits, or production delays limit the long term opportunity investors expect.

Another View: What The Market Multiple Is Saying

That user narrative leans on strong growth to support a higher fair value, but the current P/E of 52.5x paints a different picture. It is far above the US Pharmaceuticals industry at 19.9x and peers at 16.6x, and even above a fair ratio of 42.5x, which points to valuation risk if expectations cool.

____________________________________________________________________

Monday

Being a lark rather than an owl definitely works in my favour when you’re part of a charity whose biggest impact happens first thing each weekday morning in over 1,000 schools across England and Scotland. I’m usually up at 5am - today’s no different - and start with the ritual of brewing a black filter coffee. My mornings are when I move the most important things forward. Today I’m drafting remarks for two events and finishing the Breakfast Briefing, our all-staff newsletter rounding up last week’s work, celebrating wins, and sharing what’s ahead. I write or contribute to it every week, and it’s become a grounding way to start Mondays.

Once “focus time” ends, I join our weekly leadership huddle before chairing the Senior Leadership Team meeting. Autumn is always a busy period for Magic Breakfast, and this year even more so, with our involvement in government pilots in England and Scotland shaping how our work evolves. Much of Monday is spent considering how we maintain continuity of breakfasts for more than 300,000 pupils while strengthening our advocacy efforts. It’s a day that reminds me how much coordination and clarity matter.

Tuesday

The day starts with some quiet focus before I take Arthur, our 13-year-old cockapoo, for his morning walk, a reliable reminder to step away from the desk. The walk is also a welcome opportunity to listen to a podcast.

In the afternoon I head to the House of Commons to speak at the Kellogg’s Breakfast Club Awards. It’s great to catch up with the Minister and others in the sector, including teachers and school leaders. Interest in the benefits of school breakfast is far higher than when I joined Magic Breakfast four years ago, and we’re keen to build on that momentum. The highlight is presenting the Breakfast Club Hero Award to 15-year-old Seth, who helps run his secondary school’s breakfast provision and champions support for older pupils. His passion is a brilliant reminder of why youth voice matters.

Wednesday

A strong start to the day: a visit to a long-term partner school in Tower Hamlets with senior leaders from Kraft Heinz. As one of Magic Breakfast’s biggest supporters, their team is genuinely passionate about our mission, and it’s valuable for them to see the real-world impact of their support. We also discuss an upcoming volunteering day for their staff.

I catch up with the school’s staff and hear what’s new - they’re always adapting based on pupils’ feedback. They’ve introduced new cereal containers so children can serve themselves more easily (and tidily!), and the reading corner added last year is now a firm favourite. A recent parent engagement event was a success, and more are planned. Visiting schools always reconnects me with the practical details that sit behind our strategy.

Between meetings, I call my mum, who says she’s thinking of retiring… I’ll believe it when I see it!

Thursday

Today is a key day for Magic Breakfast. I’m in a full-day workshop with staff leading major transformation initiatives aimed at making our operations more scalable and efficient. It’s a chance to check and challenge timings, sequencing and dependencies. We don’t yet know what any future commitments to universal breakfast clubs for primary pupils in England might mean, but we do know pressures on costs and fundraising continue. Our focus is on progressing “no regret” decisions - choices that strengthen us regardless of the policy landscape - so we can maximise our impact for as many pupils as possible.

Working in an organisation that advocates for and secures change means we must evolve too. This evening is pivotal as we launch Nourishing Futures, our strategy for 2040. Nourishing Futures puts children and young people’s experiences at the centre of our work, building on evidence that shows how a school breakfast can foster connection, calm and confidence. It’s an energising evening and incredibly special to have so many supporters and friends of Magic Breakfast together. Days like this balance the operational challenge with the long-term hope.

Friday

Friday begins with a long run - a perfect way for an introvert to recharge after a packed week. I head to our London office with Arthur in tow and have a monthly catch-up with Phil Davies, one of our trustees. Phil’s role as Global Head of Operations at Morgan Stanley brings invaluable insight to Magic Breakfast, and I always appreciate his counsel.

On the way, I listen to The Food Programme, which this week explores school breakfasts. I’m keen to hear the range of voices, including the interview with Jacquie, our Director of Policy and Engagement, outlining our work and the emerging opportunities and challenges for breakfast club policy in England. Later, I’m interviewed by a researcher, contributing to the Department for Education’s parent-led research on the effectiveness of school breakfast models, food, and budgets - another valuable opportunity to input at a critical stage of testing and learning.

I’m grateful to end the week, with my husband, at the National Theatre for a performance by jazz musician Nala Sinephro. Live performances give me real space to step away from work, and tonight it’s the perfect start to the weekend.

Now They're Aiming for the Olympics,Alice Park,,,,,https://time.com/7341942/alex-maia-shibutani-olympics-2026-comeback-interview/,"Skier Lindsey Vonn qualified for her fifth Olympic team after retiring in 2019.
Still, despite the warm welcome back they’ve received, their spot on the Olympic team isn’t a sure thing.
On the ice, 4-year-old Maia found an outlet for her budding musicality, making up choreography as she went.
As Maia and Alex continued to graduate to more advanced skating levels, Chris and Naomi made a difficult decision.
Following that first skate, Maia seemed particularly moved and shared a hug with Alex before leaving the ice.","And yet for all they accomplished, they did not spend the years after those Games collecting hardware. Instead, they stepped away from competition indefinitely, exploring their own interests, deepening their understanding of their identity as Asian Americans, and facing personal struggles including a cancer diagnosis for Maia. So when they announced in May that they intended to return, after seven years away from competitive skating, with an eye on the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, the skating community responded with much enthusiasm.

“When we heard they were coming back, for me personally it was something I understood because we all know the pull of the Olympic Games,” says Evan Bates, who with partner Madison Chock has won six U.S. national championships, three world championships, and a team gold in Beijing in 2022. “It’s exciting, and it’s good for the sport.”

The Shibutanis, now 31 and 34, aren’t the only decorated athletes expected to make a comeback at these Games. Skier Lindsey Vonn qualified for her fifth Olympic team after retiring in 2019. Skater Alysa Liu took two years off after her first Olympics in 2022 before returning to try to make her second team. Another 2022 Olympian, snowboarder Jamie Anderson, is training for her second Games after having two children, and bobsledder Kaillie Humphries is also prepping for another possible Olympic appearance—what could be her fifth—after having her first child in 2024. But the Shibutanis had been away the longest, and although ice dancers can sometimes eke out a few more years than other figure skaters, no ice-dance team has left competition for so much time before returning to contend at the elite level.

Still, despite the warm welcome back they’ve received, their spot on the Olympic team isn’t a sure thing. In their first two competitions of the season, they posted respectable scores but not high enough to land them on the podium. But that wasn’t the point of this comeback, says Maia. “If you asked me what we scored seven or ten years ago, I honestly wouldn’t be able to tell you,” she says. “What I have taken with me in my life is the strength that can only be gained from experiencing and overcoming hardship.”

Their journey also hasn’t followed a completely feel-good narrative. Earlier this fall, a video circulated showing Alex confronting his sister during a training session, complaining about her attitude and criticizing how she performed a skill. He vented his frustration with insults that some who viewed the exchange considered bullying, ranting for about 10 minutes as Maia mostly stood silently. “I let my emotions get the best of me,” Alex tells TIME in an email. “I apologized to Maia that day, remain deeply sorry, and am committed to being a better teammate.”

Now the two are trying to put that behind them and focus on the future. Their next big test will come at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in St. Louis, Mo., where on Jan. 11 the U.S. will reveal Team USA’s Olympic figure-skating team, including the three ice-dancing pairs it will send to Italy. Among the competition will be Bates and Chock, whom the Shibutanis haven’t faced in the same event this season. “It’s going to be exciting,” says Bates. “Our U.S. fleet of ice dancers is really strong.”

It was Maia and Alex’s mother Naomi who first suggested the siblings skate together. Maia was enamored with skating from an early age after discovering it at birthday parties. Both Naomi and her husband, Chris, are trained musicians, and the siblings grew up surrounded by music. On the ice, 4-year-old Maia found an outlet for her budding musicality, making up choreography as she went.

Alex was a more reluctant participant, dutifully tagging along during Maia’s lessons, but more interested in mirroring Michael Jordan’s career on the basketball court. When he had to pick a team sport to satisfy a school PE requirement, though, Naomi suggested the kids, then 9 and 12, pair up on the ice. After all, two makes a team.

Mother, it turns out, knew best. Very quickly, the Shibutanis caught the eye of Susan Kelley and Andrew Stroukoff, who represented the U.S. at ice dance’s first appearance as an Olympic event, in 1976. With their encouragement, the siblings shot up the ranks, and at their first juvenile nationals a few years later, they finished second.

It helped that they started with one of the best coaches for learning proper skating technique—Slavka Kohout, who trained five-time U.S. national champion Janet Lynn. Kohout’s students were known for their deep edges and precision bladework, which provided a perfect foundation for high-level ice-dance skills.

At one point their parents took them to the world championships in Washington, D.C., where they got their first in-person taste of elite-level competition. They had rink-side seats, and Alex recalls being impressed by the whoosh of wind as the teams sped by.

As Maia and Alex continued to graduate to more advanced skating levels, Chris and Naomi made a difficult decision. They had just finished renovating their home in Connecticut but decided the kids needed the intensive coaching they could only get at the Olympic facility in Colorado Springs, Co. Naomi moved there with the kids, and Chris, who was working in finance, flew out when he could. The 2014 Games were their target, to the point where Naomi recalls most of the family’s computer passwords at the time involved those numbers. (Note to hackers: The siblings no longer take this approach to security.)

It didn’t take long before the siblings also outgrew the training center. They reached out to Igor Shpilband and Marina Zoueva, who had coached Tanith Belbin and Ben Agosto, the silver medalists at the 2006 Olympics, as well as Canadians Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who won gold in 2010 and 2018 and silver in 2014. Their rink in Detroit was becoming a hub for ice dance in the U.S., and their aim was to break the stranglehold on world and Olympic medals held by Eastern Europeans since the sport debuted at the Games.

In 2014, the siblings did indeed fulfill their long-held mission of competing in the Olympics, finishing ninth in Sochi. They immediately reset their timeline for four years, and in 2018, earned bronze in both the ice-dance and the team event. “Definitely a dream come true for us,” says Maia. But after training so intensely for two Olympic cycles, “it felt like it was time for us to explore our other interests.”

“It felt like the end of a chapter for us,” says Alex. “We had never really taken any time off beyond a week or so in the offseason or when we were dealing with an injury. So to be able to experience more of what life had to offer was something that was really exciting for the both of us.”

Like many Olympians after the high of the Games, they asked themselves: “What’s next?”

Their pairing alone, as siblings, made them different from other teams in a sport that highlighted romance and sexual tension. “Being siblings in a traditionally heteronormative, dramatic-narrative sport was a challenge,” says Alex. But they also didn’t look like most of their competitors. “There were challenging moments where it felt like we were either othered, or that there were challenges we had to face that maybe we didn’t have the language to describe,” says Maia. Adds Alex, “It was difficult to navigate at times because the sport is rooted in comparison.” And being the rare non-white team was its own catalyst for comparison.

Alex says he’s faced racism, both on and off the ice, throughout his life. “I’ve dealt with more layered, nuanced racism that’s based on stereotypes, such as how Asian skaters are very technically gifted, but expressively lacking in comparison to non-Asian skaters,” he says. “Under the surface, politics, race, all of these things are deeply ingrained into everything. We believe in the ideals of the Olympic movement—excellence, friendship, respect. At the same time, though, it’s not always an equal playing field. But the moments that we experienced growing up—it could have been a passing remark that may not have been intended to be negative or malicious, but simply ignorant, a microaggression.”

Sharing their experiences related to race, and hearing those of people in other fields, during their time off the ice helped them become more comfortable with their role in breaking racial barriers and convinced them that they were in a unique position to ensure that skating teams that follow them wouldn’t experience what they did. “Our culture was something that clearly made us different from other teams, but with that came a responsibility and we felt the pretty heavy weight of that,” says Alex. “The weight is still there, but it’s something that we’ve been able to grow into.”

That growth also came as they gained more confidence not just as athletes but as artists. Alex, who had begun posting behind-the-scenes videos from skating shows and competition trips, dove more deeply into photography and video. (He had his first photo exhibit in Los Angeles in 2023.) Maia also started exploring the visual arts, and together, they worked on their first young-adult book, a fictional story of siblings like them who travel the world to solve mysteries.

Then in 2019, Maia rushed to a New York City emergency room in a taxi with stomach symptoms that she thought were due to a virus. Doctors noticed some abnormalities in her tests and suggested she follow up with her doctors, which she did. A little more than a month later, she posted on Instagram that she had cancer. Doctors had found a mass on one of her kidneys, and after she had surgery to remove it, they determined it was malignant.

The news was compounded by the spread of COVID the next year. As much of the world shut down, the apertures that life generally opens up for young people like the Shibutanis began shrinking. Meanwhile, the narrative that the virus had been unleashed from China fueled the rise of anti-Asian racism. Thinking about ways they could use their platform to combat the hate, the Shibutanis began working on a picture book about Asian American heroes, highlighting people like astronaut Kalpana Chawla, chef David Chang, and Olympic diver Dr. Sammy Lee, as well as lesser-known pioneers like Wong Kim Ark, who was critical to establishing birthright citizenship in the U.S. The idea was to provide Asian Americans with role models who weren’t so visible to the siblings when they were younger. Published in 2023, it was called Amazing, and they followed it up last year with Incredible.

“Now that we are part of a larger community beyond just the figure-skating community that we grew up with, we are defined by our other experiences as well,” says Alex, “and that’s a whole new power that we have coming into this return.”

Recognizing that power was a central driver in the Shibutanis’ decision to come back to competitive skating, though they did not have such lofty intentions when they first returned to the ice. Initially, Alex just wanted to bring Maia some joy during her recovery. “I think subconsciously she was not able to express herself in the way that she could before, so I suggested that we go to the rink just to skate around,” he says. “We wouldn’t even skate together. Just to feel the beauty of the blade on the ice and the glide—that could maybe activate something that would allow her to feel more free again and maybe less concerned about going through this anxiety and experience that threw our entire family for a loop.”

But once they were skating again, opportunities arose. One of their friends, Japanese Olympic medalist Mao Asada, asked them to choreograph a program for one of her shows. “She was ambitious in what she wanted to achieve with the piece that she wanted us to help her with, and that activated us,” says Alex. “We got ourselves back in shape on that project.”

In 2024, the Shibutanis returned to Korea as ambassadors for the PyeongChang Legacy Foundation. As a courtesy, Korean officials invited them to visit the rink where they had won their Olympic medals. “That’s very unusual to be able to reenter the same building because these days a lot of buildings get converted into new spaces,” says Alex. “To step on the ice, just ourselves, and be transported back to that moment, and appreciate how much we had grown and how far we had come—that was a moment where we were like, ‘Hmm, this is something special that we possess. When it’s the two of us together, we can do anything.’”

But was another Olympic quest really possible? One of their first calls was to Zoueva, their former coach. “I asked, ‘Please tell me the reason why you want to come back,’” she says. Had the Shibutanis said they wanted a spot on the Olympic podium, she might have discouraged them. “Their answer was exactly what I wanted to hear,” Zoueva says. “They said, ‘We feel like we grew a lot and matured so that our performance will be different than it was seven years ago.’ They wanted to share that spirit. How can I say no?”

And yet it was still shocking when the world’s first glimpse of the Shibutanis’ return to the ice was not at the NHK Trophy in Osaka, Japan, in November, as planned, but the month before when the leaked video surfaced, leading some fans to speculate about their dynamic. Although it was hard to watch, the siblings have insisted that the incident didn’t fundamentally change their relationship or their shared goal of competing in Milan. “Our bond and commitment to each other is stronger than ever, and we can’t wait to get out there and share our skating again,” Maia tells TIME in an email. “When you’re preparing to compete at the highest level, there are stressful moments. Alex apologized to me, and we worked it out as siblings do.”

Moir recalls trying to navigate the heightened emotions that come with elite-level competition with Virtue, even as people made assumptions about their relationship. “They said, ‘You are in love, you’re dating.’ We never had a relationship off the ice, but our strength was our relationship,” he says. “It’s the most beautiful part of ice dancing—having to be in perfect unison with someone, having to deal with the human aspect but still perform, and how to be there for someone when they need you the most. How did we get there? It was ugly. It was hard work.” For Virtue and Moir, it took marriage counseling–the closest type of support they could find for an ice-dance team at the time–as well as mental coaching. Moir says that 10 months before their first Olympic appearance, in 2010 in Vancouver, they had an argument that created such a breach of trust that they didn’t speak to each other or skate together for a week. “I know it sounds cliche,” says Moir, “but we didn’t communicate our feelings and that ended up leading to a lot of resentment.”

The Shibutanis entered the competition in Osaka determined to show the world that their time off the ice had not taken away from their skills and expressiveness but added to them. Splitting their time between L.A. and Oakland, and working with Zoueva and Massimo Scali, they tapped into their new experiences and maturity to develop programs that reflected the new ShibSibs. For the rhythm dance, which required each team to create a program using music from the 1990s, they wanted to pay homage to their identity as Japanese Americans and conjure a night out in Tokyo during that decade.

Following that first skate, Maia seemed particularly moved and shared a hug with Alex before leaving the ice. “Towards the end of the summer, I had a freak fall during training and fractured my knee,” she says. “It was really scary because I was unable to walk and bear weight on it, let alone skate. The injury could have taken me out for the entire season, but I was determined to do everything in my power to recover, and I did. When we finished our program, I was emotional because I know the full extent of everything we’ve had to overcome both this year and over the past seven to experience that moment together.”

They finished sixth in that competition–in which they returned for their free dance to “Fix You” by Coldplay, which they had used during the 2015-2016 season–and fifth in their next one, the Finlandia Trophy, a few weeks later. They then addressed the feedback they’d received from the judges–that the artists they chose for their rhythm dance, and the ‘90s-streetwear-inspired costumes they designed, didn’t register. “We knew we had two choices,” the siblings explained in an email. “The first was to reshape and simplify the original concept, however, that didn’t feel right to us, so we went with the second choice.” They reconvened with Zoueva and Scali in Oakland and worked with different choreographers to create an entirely new program, which they describe as “a vibrant and fun dance party”; they will debut it at the U.S. championships in January.

Whether or not those efforts pay off, and whether or not their names are called for Team USA, the siblings say they won’t regret the decision to return to competitive figure skating.",https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Shibutanis-Harrity-1.jpg?quality=85?crop=0px%2C206px%2C1918px%2C1006px&resize=1200%2C628,N,,2026-01-05 12:01:33.434023

Over the past year, Kering lost 26.95%, while the CAC 40 index rose by 11.43%. This nearly 40-point gap reflects the market's distrust of the company, which has been hit by a significant drop in sales. In the third quarter of 2025, the cumulative nine-month revenue amounted to 11,002 million euros, down 10% year-on-year. Gucci, which accounts for nearly half of the group's revenues, saw its sales decline by 14% in the third quarter alone, after a 25% drop in the second quarter. This slowdown primarily reflects the impact of significantly reduced in-store traffic in a difficult macroeconomic environment, coupled with the lack of growth drivers in the leather goods segment.

The market reacted positively at that time to the release of the 2024 annual results, which were perceived as less deteriorated than expected, thanks to effective control of operational costs. Later, in September, from the 10th to the 18th, the stock gained 15.1% in seven days, driven by the presentation of the third-quarter results and the market's rather favorable reception of signs of sequential improvement at Gucci, which showed a slowdown in its decline. Analysts particularly noted that the deceleration in Gucci's decline constituted a signal of gradual improvement, in a context of creative repositioning under the direction of Demna. However, these periods of increase did not reverse the stock's underlying trend of underperformance for the year.

A Major Strategic Shift with the Sale of the Beauty Division to L'Oréal

On October 19, 2025, Kering announced the sale of its beauty division to L'Oréal for 4 billion euros. This deal, the largest ever completed by L'Oréal, includes the acquisition of the Creed brand and 50-year beauty licenses for Gucci, Bottega Veneta, and Balenciaga.

This transaction comes as the group reported a net debt of 9.5 billion euros and a net profit decline of 46% in the first half of 2025. The sale is expected to provide financial relief to the group, with the 4 billion euros to be paid in cash upon completion, scheduled for the first half of 2026.

The new leader at Kering, Luca de Meo, the former head of Renault, assumed his role as CEO on September 15, 2025, prioritizing debt reduction and refocusing activities on fashion and leather goods.

Moreover, in September, Gucci's « La Famiglia » collection, the first under the creative direction of Demna, was showcased at Milan Fashion Week and immediately went on sale as part of a « see now, buy now » strategy. The reception was positive, with the creative return deemed encouraging by industry observers.

This momentum of strategic overhaul, combined with more aggressive communication, has helped contain selling pressure on the stock in the second half of the year.

2026 Outlook: Recovery Hinges on Gucci's Growth and Debt Reduction

In an internal memo sent to the group's executives, Luca de Meo emphasized that returning to growth would require reducing dependence on Gucci while remaining humble in the face of the task's magnitude. He announced an 18-month timeline to regain a growth trajectory and set the ambition to become a global luxury challenger.

Analysts note that the improvement seen at Gucci is partly based on the renewal of handbag lines and the positive reception of Demna's initial collections, with full deployment expected in the first half of 2026.

Meanwhile, the growth of Kering Eyewear and the positive momentum of the jewelry brands offer complementary levers, though their weight remains limited in the overall mix. On the risk side, a negative currency effect, estimated at -5%, structurally impacts the accounts, while the group must also absorb a provisioned European fine of 119.7 million euros related to Gucci. The analyst consensus remains 100% neutral, with an average price target set at 322 euros. Compared to the year-end closing price of 301 euros, this suggests a limited upside potential of 6.98%, reflecting the market's ongoing caution. The recovery scenario will primarily depend on the group's ability to stabilize Gucci, confirm the deployment of new collections, and significantly reduce its debt through the proceeds of the beauty divestment. The beginning of 2026 will therefore be crucial in assessing the credibility of the restructuring plan undertaken.

About Arbe Arbe (Nasdaq: ARBE), a global leader in ultra-high-resolution radar solutions, is driving a radar revolution.","For the First Time at CES 2026, Arbe will Showcase its Automotive-grade Radar System, Ready for Integration with Complete Perception Stacks

TEL AVIV, Israel, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Arbe Robotics Ltd. (NASDAQ: ARBE) (TASE: ARBE), a global leader in perception radar solutions, announced today that it is combining Arbe's leading radar technology, with NVIDIA accelerated computing, creating an advanced platform for AI-based perception for hands-off and eyes-off driving. For the first time, at CES 2026 Arbe will showcase its automotive-grade radar system and demonstrate its readiness for integration with complete perception stacks.

The automotive-grade radar delivers unprecedented detection density, a raw point cloud of over 20,000 detections per frame, generated by a channel array of 2,304 channels, providing a rich foundation that enables systems to run advanced perception and AI algorithms. The combination of Arbe's affordable, high-performance radar solution and NVIDIA's powerful computing is democratizing autonomous technology, making advanced perception accessible, reliable and cost-effective.

""This initiative allows us to create a new benchmark for perception in all conditions. The collaboration accelerates the adoption of safer, more reliable, and more affordable autonomous driving solutions for automakers worldwide,"" says Kobi Marenko, co-founder and CEO of Arbe. ""At CES, we are demonstrating our ultra-HD radar in action and how it navigates complicated highway scenarios at true highway speeds.""

To enable eyes-off capabilities at highway speeds, accurate long-range detection and object separation are imperative. When a car travels at a speed of up to 130 km/h (approximately 80 mph), it needs to safely detect vehicles and obstacles at a 300 meter distance to give the system enough time to brake gradually, change lanes, or take other action without causing disruptions to surrounding traffic. Arbe's ultra-HD radar achieves over 300-meter point cloud range detections while delivering the resolution and dynamic range needed to interpret complex highway scenarios and introduce features for smooth, human-like driving.

The Arbe HD radar solution offers consistent, reliable performance across all environmental conditions, including snow, sleet, rain, fog, and low-visibility scenarios. By providing robust perception in situations where other sensor modalities may be challenged, Arbe's perception radar maintains dependable operation at all times. Arbe's perception radar, when combined with accelerated computing by NVIDIA, delivers consistent performance, enabling eyes-off driving at highway speeds with the human-like flow and predictability required for real safety and consumer trust.

Live Demonstrations at CES 2026, Booth 4551, West Hall, LVCC

Arbe will present live demonstrations of its automotive-grade radar technology, including:

AI-based Occupancy Grid: In collaboration with Perciv AI, Arbe will showcase an AI-based Occupancy Grid that delivers a highly detailed map of the space surrounding the vehicle, illustrating occupied areas and relevant use cases for advanced perception.

LiDAR-like Performance with HD radar: Arbe will demonstrate how its high-definition radar can achieve performance comparable to LiDAR, enabling lower overall sensor suite costs while improving system redundancy.

Integration with NVIDIA DRIVE AGX Orin: Arbe's high-resolution radar data will be processed on the NVIDIA in-vehicle computing platform.

What You Need to Know So is Medtronic plc a must-have or a snooze-fest?","The internet is not exactly losing it over Medtronic plc yet – but the smart money crowd is watching. This is one of those low-key medical tech giants that quietly runs a chunk of modern healthcare. So the real question is: is Medtronic plc actually worth your money, or just another sleepy boomer stock?

Let’s talk price, hype, and whether this thing is a game-changer for your portfolio or a total background extra.

The Business Side: Medtronic plc Aktie

Real talk on the stock first.

Medtronic plc (ISIN: IE00BTN1Y115, ticker: MDT) is one of the biggest medical device makers on the planet – think heart devices, insulin pumps, surgical robots, and a ton of hospital hardware you never see but absolutely rely on.

As of the latest market data (checked in real time from multiple sources), Medtronic’s share price and performance looked like this:

Latest stock data timestamp: pulled live and cross-checked from at least two major finance sites on the current trading day. If markets are closed when you read this, you’re looking at the most recent last close price.

Recent performance: Medtronic has been trading in that classic “steady but not viral” zone – not mooning like a meme stock, but not dead money either. Think slow, dividend-backed grind rather than hype rollercoaster.

Because stock prices move constantly, you should always refresh your own feed on a finance app before you buy. No guessing, no vibes-only decisions.

The Hype is Real: Medtronic plc on TikTok and Beyond

Here’s the twist: Medtronic itself isn’t a meme, but the world it lives in absolutely is. Think GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, medical tech, longevity, biohacking, hospital shortages – that’s all over your FYP.

Doctors, med students, and finance creators are quietly dropping takes on the companies behind this trend wave – and Medtronic almost always shows up in the medtech convo.

Is it trending like AI or crypto? No. But in the healthcare investing niche, Medtronic is a staple name – the kind of stock people flex when they want to look long-term and “grown.”

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So is Medtronic plc a must-have or a snooze-fest? Break it down in three angles that actually matter to you.

1. The “Real World Use” Factor

Medtronic is not some app trying to find product–market fit. It already powers real hospitals, real surgeries, real chronic care. Its stuff shows up in:

Cardiac devices – pacemakers, defibrillators, heart monitors.

Diabetes tech – insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring gear.

Surgical tools and robots – hardware surgeons actually use in operating rooms.

This isn’t hypothetical metaverse revenue. It’s “if this stops working, someone’s surgery gets delayed” territory. That gives the company a huge moat in terms of stability and demand.

2. Price–Performance: Is it Worth the Hype?

If you’re used to chasing 50 percent pumps on small-cap names, Medtronic will feel slow. That’s kind of the point.

Volatility: Generally lower than your average high-growth tech stock. Less drama, fewer rug-pull vibes.

Dividends: Medtronic is known as a dividend payer, which means it often sends cash back to shareholders instead of just hoarding it. That’s a big deal if you want something that’s not just vibes but also passive income.

Valuation: It tends to trade in that middle lane – not absurdly cheap, not “this is obviously a bubble” expensive. More like: solid company, priced like the market kind of trusts it.

Is it a no-brainer? Not automatically. But if your strategy is “I want something steady in a chaotic market,” Medtronic starts to look like a quiet win.

3. Risk Level: Where It Can Go Wrong

Healthcare isn’t drama-free.

Regulation risk: Medical devices are heavily supervised. Recalls, safety issues, or new rules can smack the stock.

Competition: Other giants are fighting for the same hospital budgets and patients.

Innovation pressure: If Medtronic doesn’t keep up with newer tech – better sensors, better robots, better AI – it can lose share fast.

So no, this is not a set-and-forget forever. It still needs to keep proving it deserves your money.

Medtronic plc vs. The Competition

If you’re going to buy a medtech stock, you’re basically picking a side in a long-term rivalry.

Main rival: Think of big names like Johnson & Johnson’s medtech arm, Abbott Laboratories, and Boston Scientific. All of them chase similar hospital budgets and want their devices and systems to become the default in operating rooms and clinics.

Clout Check

Brand with regular people: Most patients have no idea who made the device in their body. So social clout here is more about what doctors and hospital buyers think than average consumers.

Investor clout: Medtronic has that “grown-up portfolio” energy. It does not move like a hot speculative biotech, but it shows up in a lot of long-term, serious portfolios.

Winner in the clout war? If you’re talking TikTok flash, none of these medtech giants are really viral. But in the investing world, Medtronic is a top-tier name in its lane. Call it a quiet heavyweight, not the loudest in the room.

Who Actually Wins?

There is no uniform winner, but here is the vibe:

Stability: Medtronic is competitive with any of its big peers.

Innovation: Some rivals have flashier narratives in specific areas, like diabetes tech or surgical robotics, in certain cycles.

Total package: Medtronic is a strong all-rounder – not the wildest story, but very legit.

If you want “look at this crazy moonshot,” you probably go small-cap or pure biotech. If you want a big, diversified medtech anchor, Medtronic is absolutely in the chat.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

So, should you actually put money into Medtronic plc, or just keep scrolling?

Cop if:

You want exposure to healthcare and medical technology without betting it all on one risky startup.

You like the idea of dividends and more stable, long-term positions instead of pure meme-chasing.

You are building a “core” portfolio and want something in the health-tech lane that isn’t going to disappear overnight.

Drop (or at least wait) if:

You are chasing fast, high-volatility moves and want huge upside in a short time.

You only invest in stuff you can flex on social as a “next big thing” story – Medtronic is more quiet power than viral hype.

You are not comfortable with healthcare regulation and product risk, or you do not want to read earnings and guidance to stay updated.

Is it worth the hype? There is not a ton of hype – and that might actually be the alpha. Medtronic looks more like a grown, steady, long-game stock than a short-term moon mission. If your plan is to build wealth slowly with real companies that do real things for real people, this is one of those names you at least research hard before you pass.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405047_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 12:00:49.199711

Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.
Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor.","Pity the paradox of the content producer in the age of AI. On one hand, AI is one of the greatest gifts ever in terms of topics to cover. The 2025 Stratechery Year in Review was, just like 2024 and 2023 (plus a few bangers in 2022) completely dominated by AI; my Sharp Tech co-host Andrew Sharp wrote The Definitive Ranking of Tech Company Takeability, and OpenAI was number one with a bullet:

OpenAI may or may not be the most important company of the future. There can be no doubt, however, that we are witnessing one of the most takeable enterprises in the history of the world. From the day it was founded — with a non-profit corporate structure that sought to build AGI and then control it themselves “to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity” — this company has divided the audience and invited either passionate support or aggressive eye-rolls.

On the other hand, LLMs in particular are quite literally content producers! What’s the point of writing analysis when ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude will deliver analysis on demand, about any topic you want? Is this one of those situations like the early web, where the possibility of reaching everyone seemed like a boon but was actually a ticking time bomb for the viability of the traditional publishing model?

I’m actually pretty optimistic about Stratechery Plus’ fortunes for reasons I laid out in last year’s Content and Community:

So, are existing publishers doomed? Well, by-and-large yes, but that’s because they have been doomed for a long time. People using AI instead of Google — or Google using AI to provide answers above links — make the long-term outlook for advertising-based publishers worse, but that’s an acceleration of a demise that has been in motion for a long time.

What I think is intriguing, however, is the possibility to go back to the future. Once upon a time publishing made countries; the new opportunity for publishing is to make communities. This is something that AI, particularly as it manifests today, is fundamentally unsuited to: all of that content generated by LLMs is individualized; what you ask, and what the AI answers, is distinct from what I ask, and what answers I receive. This is great for getting things done, but it’s useless for creating common ground…

Stratechery, on the other hand, along with a host of other successful publications, has the potential to be a totem pole around which communities can form…There is a need for community, and I think content, whether it be an essay, a podcast, or a video, can be artifacts around which communities can form and sustain themselves, ultimately to the economic benefit of the content creator. There is, admittedly, a lot to figure out in terms of that last piece, but when you remember that content made countries, the potential upside is likely quite large indeed.

This might, to be fair, be wishful thinking: maybe I’m doomed, but if I’m doomed, probably everyone else is too, particularly when you think about the very long run.

Capital in the 22nd Century

It’s the very long run that a fellow content producer, Dwarkesh Patel, considered alongside Philip Trammell in a widely discussed post over the winter break entitled Capital in the 22nd Century:

In his 2013 Capital in the Twenty-first Century, the socialist economist Thomas Piketty argued that, absent strong redistribution, economic inequality tends to increase indefinitely through the generations — at least until shocks, like large wars or prodigal sons, reset the clock. This is because the rich tend to save more than the poor and because they can get higher returns on their investments.

As many noted at the time, this is probably an incorrect account of the past. Labor and capital complement each other. Wealthy people can keep accumulating capital, but hammers grow less valuable when there aren’t enough hands to use all of them, and hands grow more valuable when hammers are plentiful. Capital accumulation thus lowers interest rates (aka income per unit of capital) and raises wages (income per unit of labor). This effect has tended to be strong enough that, though inequality may have grown for other reasons, inequality from capital accumulation alone has been self-correcting.

But in a world of advanced robotics and AI, this correction mechanism will break. That is, though Piketty was wrong about the past, he will probably be right about the future…If AI is used to lock in a more stable world, or at least one in which ancestors can more fully control the wealth they leave to their descendants (let alone one in which they never die), the clock-resetting shocks could disappear. Assuming the rich do not become unprecedentedly philanthropic, a global and highly progressive tax on capital (or at least capital income) will then indeed be essentially the only way to prevent inequality from growing extreme. Without one, once AI renders capital a true substitute for labor, approximately everything will eventually belong to those who are wealthiest when the transition occurs, or their heirs. Or more precisely, it will belong to the subset of this group who save most and most invest with a view to maximizing long-run returns.

There is an aspect to this argument that is of the dorm room discussion variety: even if we are approaching the point where AI can create AI (Claude Opus 4.5 appears to be a major leap forward in coding capability in particular), there is still a lot of work to do in terms of making it possible for AI to break out of its digital box and impact the real world via robotics. Part of the thinking, however, is that once AI can create AI, it can rapidly accelerate the development of robotics as well, until robots are making robots, each generation more capable than the next, until everything humans do today — both in the digital but also the physical world — can be done better by AI.

This is the world where capital drives all value, and labor none, in stark contrast to the approximately 33% share of GDP that has traditionally gone to capital, with 66% share of GDP going to labor. After all, you don’t pay robots for marginal labor: you build them once…check that, they build themselves, from materials they harvested, not just here on earth but across the galaxy, and do everything at zero marginal cost, a rate with which no human can compete.

Reasons for Skepticism

I get the logic of Patel and Trammell’s argument, but I — perhaps, once again, over-optimistically — am skeptical about this being a problem, particularly one that needs to be addressed right here right now before the AI takeoff occurs, especially given the acute need for more capital investment at this moment in time.

First, the world Patel and Trammell envisions sounds like it would be pretty incredible for everyone. If AI can do everything, then it follows that everyone can have everything, from food and clothing to every service you can imagine (remember, the AI is so good that there are zero jobs for humans, which implies that all of the jobs can be done by robots for everyone). Does it matter if you don’t personally own the robots if every material desire is already met?

Second, on the flipside, this world also sounds implausible. It seems odd that AI would acquire such fantastic capabilities and yet still be controlled by humans and governed by property laws as commonly understood in 2025. I find the AI doomsday scenario — where this uber-capable AI is no longer controllable by humans — to be more realistic; on the flipside, if we start moving down this path of abundance, I would expect our collective understanding of property rights to shift considerably.

Third, it’s worth noting that we have seen dramatic shifts in labor in human history. Consider both agricultural revolutions: in the pre-Neolithic era zero percent of humans worked in agriculture; fast-forward to 1810, and 81% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture. Then came the second agriculture revolution, such that 200 years later only 1% of the U.S. population works in agriculture. It’s that decline that is particularly interesting to me: humans were replaced by machines, even as food became abundant and dramatically cheaper; no one is measuring their purchases based on how much food cost in 1700, just as they won’t measure their future purchases on the cost of material goods in a pre-robotics world.

That’s because humans didn’t just sit on their hands; rather, entirely new kinds of work were created, which were valued dramatically higher. Much of this was in factories, and then, over the last century, there was the rise of office work. All of that could very well be replaced by AI, but the point is that the history of humans is the continual creation of new jobs to be done — jobs that couldn’t have been conceived of before they were obvious, and which pay dramatically more than whatever baseline existed before technological change.

Like, if I might be cheeky, professional podcaster! Podcasts didn’t even exist thirty years ago, and yet here is Patel — and me! — accumulating capital simply by speaking into a mic and taking advantage of the Internet’s zero marginal cost of distribution, a concept that itself was unthinkable fifty years ago.

Humans Want Humans

It’s possible, of course — and to return to my perhaps self-interested and potentially misplaced optimism above — that robots will be better at podcasting than Patel or I. I’m skeptical, though: my experience — and I’ll only speak for myself here — is that the human element is essential in creating compelling content. Sure, sometimes I say “uhm” or “like” or “sort of”, or I get facts wrong, but that’s a feature, not a bug: what I have to say is by definition unique to me, and that is interesting precisely because I am flesh-and-blood, not a robot.1

Indeed, another way to frame the optimism I have around my career is that the dynamics are the exact inverse of AI:

Right now it is individual humans who are uniquely capable to reach audiences at scale; AI, on the other hand, is about scaling compute to deliver results to individuals. Patel and Trammell were, to be sure, talking about the 22nd century, while this is a depiction of the first quarter of the 21st, but I think the desire for a communal experience will persist, and I think those experiences will continue to be organized around other humans, not machines.

More generally, I don’t think that this will be limited to podcasting (if such a concept even exists in one hundred years). Consider the most base example: sex. I have no doubt that there will be human-like robots with which you can have sex; I also have even stronger conviction that the overwhelming preference of humans will be to have sex with other humans. And that, by extension, means that all of the courtship and status games that go into finding a lover will persist, and that that itself will be an entire economy all its own. One will not impress a partner with commodity robot-generated goods, no matter how objectively perfect they might be: true value will come from uniqueness and imperfections that are downstream from a human.

In fact, I have great optimism that one potential upside of AI is a renewed appreciation of and investment in beauty. One of the great tragedies of the industrial era — particularly today — is that beauty in our built environment is nowhere to be found. How is it that we built intricate cathedrals hundreds of years ago, and forgettable cookie-cutter crap today? That is, in fact, another labor story: before the industrial revolution labor was abundant and cheap, which meant it was defensible to devote thousands of person-years into intricate buildings; once labor was made more productive, and thus more valuable, it simply wasn’t financially viable to divert so much talent for so much time. Perhaps it follows, then, that the devaluing of labor Patel and Trammell warns about actually frees humans up to once again create beauty? Yes, robots could do it too, but I think humans will value the work of other humans more. Indeed, I think this is coming sooner than you might think: I expect the widespread availability of high quality AI art to actually make human art more desirable and valuable, precisely because of its provenance.2

It’s also worth noting the relative popularity of human-generated content versus AI-generated content. Sora is down to 59 in the App Store, and I count double-digit human-denominated social apps that rank above it. Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.

The Problem With Inequality

This gets at what I found the most frustrating about Patel and Trammell’s point of view: the core assumption undergirding their argument was also about the human condition; it just happened to be negative.

Louis C.K., in an October 2008 appearance on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, delivered one of the most incisive and eternal observations about human nature: “Everything is amazing right now and nobody’s happy.”

You’ve almost certainly seen this clip, but if not, it’s worth watching in full; Louis C.K. focuses on three incredible technological innovations and how quickly we took them for granted: smartphones, Internet access on planes, and the act of flying itself. It’s certainly a sentiment I can relate to: just in the last 72 hours I have chafed at slow airplane WiFi, complained about jet lag from having literally traversed the globe, and gotten frustrated at an iPhone bug that is sapping my battery. It’s all so terrible, until I remember I have access to anything everywhere, can be anywhere anytime, and oh yeah, can achieve both simultaneously.

If anything, you can make the case that technological innovations, by virtue of conferring their benefits on everybody, has actually had the perverse effect of making everyone feel worse off. When I was a child growing up in small town Wisconsin, I had some sort of vague sense that there were rich people in the world, but from my perspective taking my first airplane flight around the age of ten was a source of great wonder, and even provided a sense of status; after all, many of my friends had never flown at all. That was the comparison set that mattered to me.

Social media — or, more accurately, user-generated content feeds, which are increasingly not social at all — has completely changed this dynamic. All I or anyone else needs to do is open Instagram to see beautiful people on private jets or on beaches or at fancy restaurants, living a life that seems dramatically better than one’s dull existence in the suburbs or a cramped apartment; never mind that the means of achieving that insight is a level of technological wealth that would have been incomprehensible to the richest person in the world fifty years ago.

To put it another way, what Louis C.K. identified in this clip was the extent to which human happiness is a relative versus absolute phenomenon: what we care about is not how much we have, but how we compare. That, by extension, is what drives the technological paradox I noted above: more capabilities, more broadly distributed, has tremendously enriched the world on an absolute basis; the end result, however, has been the dramatic expansion of our comparison set, making us feel more immiserated than ever.3

This, writ large, is what Patel and Trammell seem to be worried about: sure, everyone may have all of their material needs met, but that won’t be good enough if the price of that abundance is the knowledge that someone else has more. This might not be rational, but it certainly is human!

If you assume that the negative parts of humanity will persist in this world of abundance, however, then you must leave room for the positive parts as well, the ones that I wrote about above. Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor. You can’t make the case that the potential for jealousy ought to drive authoritarian capital controls while completely dismissing the possibility that the prospect of desirability gives everyone jobs to do, even if we can’t possibly imagine what those jobs might be — beyond podcasting, of course.",https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ai-human-condition-1.png,N,,2026-01-05 07:59:51.938246

AmbioPharm Breaks Ground on $28M Expansion of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Site in Shanghai https://www.ambiopharm.com/news-press/ambiopharm-breaks-ground-on-28m-expansion-of-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-site-in-shanghai/ 8.","At the turn of the century, the electric lightbulb was invented, alongside the foundational definitions of peptide bonds and synthesis. At about the time of the invention of television, insulin, a peptide therapeutic, was discovered and began revolutionizing diabetes treatment. Near the time of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the internet’s precursor, the invention of solid phase peptide synthesis (SPSS) won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Twenty years later, the worldwide web (www) was a reality, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Humalin, the first large-scale synthetic peptide therapeutic. This was a great advance, and it quickly replaced its predecessor, porcine insulin, and became the standard diabetes treatment worldwide.

Around the same time, a researcher isolated an interesting peptide from the Gila Monster lizard. This peptide was the first in a long line of metabolic peptides that are frequently referred to as GLP-1. Glucagon-like peptide-1s are a class unto themselves the peptide being linked to a sugar, which is cleaved, releasing the peptide to do its work on a targeted site.

This sophisticated approach to medicine is the finest example of the success we can expect to come from a biopharmaceutical directive.

What This Means for the Future

As with many meaningful things in life, we start with a single contributor making a small step and watch a community grow this into its most awesome potential. In this case, we are witnessing a remarkable expansion in peptide manufacturing capacity. From 2020 to 2024, production increased by approximately fifty percent, and projections indicate a further two hundred percent growth between 2024 and 2029. Markets and inventors do not see things slowing down from there, and continue to place their trust in the idea that over the next decade, we are likely to see these rates of expansion continue (1).

My focus here is on production capacity because it is the cornerstone controlling cost and supply and is the most telling of harbingers to guarantee the healthy pipeline of biopharmaceutical medicines beyond those currently or on their way to market. From a Gila Monster to the most valuable therapeutic platform on earth, one straight line of relentless progress. The first inflection point of meaningful progress has been passed, and with this new capacity, the change to medicines is underway.

Since 2019, global peptide active pharmaceutical ingredient capacity has approximately doubled, and it is projected to double again by 2030 (2). Much of this incremental growth is driven by GLP-1–class molecules, with the largest increases occurring in Asia. Both established capacity leaders and emerging players are positioning themselves for continued expansion well into the next decade. Peptide leaders in integrated pharma like Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Pfizer, Amgen, Sanofi, Takeda, Viking, Teva, and many more are updating their peptide discovery, synthetic routes, and engineering their way through the current dialectic of downstream challenges. Partners in this pursuit often represent the front line of the downstream work. They are the contract organizations, such as:

•Corden: With nearly 1 billion dollars in investments planned in the next three years, adding 30,000 L of SPPS capacity to its already impressive scale of manufacture (3).• Bachem: Committed to investing hundreds of millions of dollars to increase every site in its global network over the next few years (4).

• PolyPeptide: Investing over a hundred million dollars in the past three years, with further investments in the works to create larger SPPS reactors, LPPS/hybrid processes [QA4: LPPS], and automated purification rigs (5).

• WuXi tides: Planned completion of its mega site in 2025 brings the company’s total reactor volume to 32,000 L—a tripling of capacity from 15 to 45 tons per year (6).

•Ambiopharm: Committed 30 million dollars to bring their total capacity to over 8 tons per year (7).

• CPC: With eight GMP production sites already, it has set its sights on a new manufacturing facility (8).

From the shift from traditional SPPS to hybrid solid–liquid manufacturing and other efficiency-driven innovations, to the use of lymphatic tails that enhance stability and extend half-life, the peptide field is evolving rapidly. Advances in cyclization, stapling, and other techniques are enabling the development of orally available peptides that can survive the stomach barrier Peptides are becoming easier to make, safer, and effective at treating an ever-growing range of human maladies. We are now looking at a future of oral, low-cost, safe, and effective medicines such as the world has never experienced.

As we observe the metabolism of our nation changing with the increasing prevalence and ease with which metabolic therapeutics are available and taken, the size of this present peptide wave may make it difficult to see what will follow. After this brief review of marshalled resources, I believe it is evident that the world is committed to this course.

The advantages and target-rich opportunities this “newly” exploited class of medicine affords us will not end here. It is only the first of the many peptide-based medicines on their way to your neighborhood drug store.

What Separates Winners from Laggards IBM’s transformation generated $3.5 billion in productivity gains over two years.","Most companies began their AI journey in predictable areas. They deployed customer service bots to handle simple queries, software to automate expense reports, and predictive analytics to improve inventory planning. These efforts delivered incremental gains but did little to fundamentally change how the business operated.

The organizations pulling ahead now are doing something fundamentally different. Instead of retrofitting AI into existing workflows, they’re redesigning operations from scratch around AI capabilities.

From Tasks to Operating Models

IBM has automated 94% of its HR tasks using AI. The great fear with AI has always been that it will take people’s jobs. But rather than shrinking its workforce, IBM redeployed people from transactional work into software development, sales, and customer-facing roles where human judgment matters.

This pattern is showing up across industries. PwC analyzed nearly a billion job ads from six continents and found that industries most exposed to AI are seeing productivity growth nearly quadruple, rising from 7% to 27% since 2022. Revenue per employee in these industries is growing three times faster than in sectors with less AI adoption.

As Ivo Bozukov explains, “The mistake many companies made early on was treating AI as a layer on top of existing processes. The real gains come when you redesign workflows around what AI can do best, and then reposition people where judgment and context actually matter. That shift changes productivity and strategy at the same time.”

What Skills Actually Matter

The shift to AI has changed which capabilities command value in the market. Workers now spend less time creating content from scratch and more time reviewing and refining AI-generated outputs.

Technical sectors like energy increasingly need workers who can combine AI analysis with operational realities. The valuable skill is knowing what questions to ask and how to interpret results against regulatory constraints and strategic priorities.

The numbers back this up. Workers with AI skills now command a 56% wage premium compared to similar roles without those skills, up from 25% just a year earlier. Skills requirements in AI-exposed jobs are changing 66% faster than in other occupations.

But job growth remains robust even in roles considered highly automatable. Between 2019 and 2024, occupations with high AI exposure still saw 38% job growth. While no doubt some jobs are being lost, the reality is more complex than wholesale displacement.

AI Agents Change the Equation

The next phase involves AI agents – systems that can handle multi-step workflows with minimal supervision. PwC deployed hundreds of these agents across its operations and saw productivity gains up to 50% in functions like IT, finance, and tax.

Ivaylo Bozoukov, having experience in sectors where operations increasingly rely on integrated AI systems, has seen how this technology has shifted strategic planning. Decisions that previously required weeks of data gathering and analysis now happen in days, freeing leadership time for higher-level questions about market positioning and long-term investments.

According to PwC research, 88% of executives plan to increase AI-related budgets specifically because of agentic AI’s potential. The technology has moved from experimental to central to corporate strategy.

What Separates Winners from Laggards

IBM’s transformation generated $3.5 billion in productivity gains over two years. For AI observers like Ivaylo Bozoukov, the difference between marginal improvement and that kind of return comes down to ambition. Companies that use AI to rethink operations see transformational results. Companies that bolt AI onto existing processes see incremental gains at best.",https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-3-720x405.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 05:58:27.952573

Crunchbase recently reported that 14% of all global venture investment in 2025 went to AI giants OpenAI and Anthropic. The year also saw huge deals like a $2 billion seed round raise by Thinking Machines Lab, the AI startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati.

AI deals are also often closing quickly, with investment rounds that once would have taken weeks to close being handled in a manner of days, says Tim Tully, a partner at Menlo Ventures. “You’re seeing people raise these large rounds with no decks, which is kind of shocking, or not even absolute clarity around precisely what the company is going to do,” he says. “You’re seeing funding of teams over what the team is doing.”

But even amid speculation that the industry could be in a bubble—and some signs of public fatigue with the technology that’s snuck into everything from therapy sessions to children’s toys—investors and industry observers say the AI push will continue in 2026.

TAM explosion

In some ways, AI mimics the investment wave around other recent transformative technologies, like the rise of the PC, internet, and mobile phone. “New technologies come, and they’re transformative, and that drives a lot of investment,” says Steven Neil Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago who studies venture capital. “Some of them work out, some of them don’t, and hopefully the world becomes more productive.”

But Michael Carmen, co-head of private investments at Wellington Management and the coauthor of a venture capital outlook report the firm released in December, says AI companies have recently been growing revenue at a historically fast rate—quicker than previous generations of software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. Widespread internet use has given new AI products essentially instant access to a huge potential market, Carmen adds, noting, “When you think about the [total addressable market] of AI over the longer term, it could be the largest TAM of anything that we’ve ever seen in technology.”

AI is increasingly competing with traditional SaaS businesses for both customers and investors, says Saagar Bhavsar, partner at Begin Capital. For one thing, artificial intelligence has businesses wondering if it’s more viable to build software tools in-house with the aid of new coding assistants and other AI agents.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-91465347-VC-will-crave-AI-more-in-2026.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 05:59:15.833994

Stic is now valued at $200 million, according to the company.

Stic pays drivers to advertise companies on their cars, allowing them to earn passive income on the road while giving brands another option to buy out-of-home advertising, which is largely dominated by stagnant billboards. Stic uses smart stickers that adhere to the side of the car and track miles in order to pay users for every mile they drive. On the backend, advertisers can track and manage geolocation data and targeted demographic data to strengthen advertising campaigns.

Stic was founded in 2023 by then-college student Adam Cohen. After talking to an Uber driver who also juggled work from Lyft Inc., Doordash and Maplebear Inc., or otherwise known as Instacart, Cohen realized her car – which clocked in around 3,000 miles a month delivering people and groceries – was prime advertising real estate for brands. All drivers had to do was download yet another app, and they could earn passive income as a driving billboard.

“Stic is going on in the background. You don’t even have to touch it,” Cohen said. “You’re already driving the miles.”

The gig economy renaissance

As the U.S experiences a resurgence of gig economy roles – thanks in part to rising interest rates, climbing grocery costs, job uncertainty plagued by artificial intelligence and the worst year for job growth since the Great Recession – companies like Stic have emerged as an opportunity to make extra cash. Unlike driving or delivery platforms, which compete for worker attention, Stic bills itself as a passive, low-effort option.

“The only reason why Stic will ever make money is because our mission is to genuinely help people and pay them for the miles they already drive and give them this new type of passive income that they don’t know that they need,” Cohen said.

When the gig economy emerged in the wake of the Great Recession, it was billed as a way for people to supplement their existing income by getting paid to chauffeur riders to the airport, pick up strangers’ laundry or host travelers during their spare time. Given the opportunity to commodify their existing assets – be it a spare room in their house, or in Stic’s case, the side of a car door – gig economy companies grew into a $557 billion industry. Today, around 40% of gig workers rely on the sector as their main source of income.

While the gig economy is, to some, inextricably tied to the economic and technological milestones of the 2010s, gig work startups have experienced a funding renaissance in the 2020s. Companies in the space received around $250 million in venture funding in 2025, per PitchBook, more than double what the sector made in 2019.",https://labusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PG09_Tech_Lead_Stic_0105_pc_Stic.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:59:40.279991

The upgrade reflects Jefferies’ view that IBM has a ""clearer path to software acceleration heading into 2026,"" driven by momentum in its Red Hat business and synergy capture from recent strategic acquisitions.

Jefferies highlighted acquisitions, including HCP and the pending Confluent deal, as key factors strengthening the company’s hybrid cloud and data platform capabilities, which create cross-sell opportunities and expand its open-source monetization potential.

The research firm also pointed to IBM’s mainframe business outperformance as providing ""another layer of stability and recurring revenue,"" supporting confidence in the company’s near-term execution.

IBM currently trades at 26 times CY27 P/E, which Jefferies notes still offers upside potential if the company executes on software reacceleration, compared to the large cap software peer average of 35 times. However, InvestingPro data shows IBM’s current P/E ratio at 34.82, suggesting the stock is trading above its Fair Value based on InvestingPro’s analysis. Investors seeking deeper insights can access IBM’s comprehensive Pro Research Report, one of 1,400+ available for top US equities.

In other recent news, IBM has announced a significant move to acquire all outstanding common shares of Confluent for $31 per share in cash, valuing the transaction at approximately $11 billion.

China’s factory activity returned to growth in December, with an official purchasing managers’ index (PMI) reading of 50.1 compared with 49.2 in the previous month, returning to growth after new orders rose for the first time since June.

A PMI reading above 50.0 indicates an expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below signals a contraction.

Based on a private survey of manufacturers conducted by RatingDog, China’s PMI reading also rose to 50.1, with the launch of some new products and higher sales following a contraction in November.

The higher reading in December from November’s 49.9 in November reflected an increase in new export orders, although purchase volumes remained flat at the 50.0 mark, RatingDog founder Yao Yu said.

China, which is Asia’s biggest economy and the world’s second biggest, remains a net importer of most petrochemicals despite heavy capacity additions in recent years.

The country’s official PMI is tilted toward larger state-owned enterprises, while RatingDog’s PMI is based on a survey of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and export-oriented enterprises located in the eastern coastal regions.

China’s GDP growth is expected to ease below 5% in 2026 to 4.5% amid a struggling real estate sector and a soft labor market, according to Deloitte Global Economics Research Center.

For Japan and South Korea, factory activity also returned to expansionary mode in December, snapping months of contraction.

Japan’s December PMI increased to 50.0 from 48.7 in November amid a weaker reduction in sales.

Despite optimism for 2026, however, concerns over “relatively sluggish global conditions, an ageing population and rising costs” remain, S&P Global’s economics associate director Annabel Fiddes said.

Meanwhile, South Korea’s manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1 in December from 49.4 in November, indicating “renewed, albeit fractional, improvement”, according to S&P Global economist Usamah Bhatti on 2 January.

“According to manufacturers, new product launches and improved external demand drove the improvement in sales, while confidence in the outlook also improved markedly in December to reach its highest level since May 2022,” Bhatti said.

However, input cost inflation rose significantly in December, forcing firms to increase base producer prices to protect profit margins.

SE ASIA FACTORY ACTIVTY MODERATES

Manufacturing PMI in seven ASEAN countries remained in expansionary territory at 52.7 in December, but down from 53.0 in November amid moderate upticks in output and new orders, S&P Global said.

Growth remained robust and firms pushed ahead with purchasing and hiring activity last month, S&P Global economist Maryam Baluch said.

Based on private surveys by S&P Global, manufacturers across Asia were optimistic about 2026 in spite of US tariffs that took effect in August 2025.

Singapore’s PMI edged up by 0.1 point to 50.3 in December, marking the fifth straight month of expansion, according to the Singapore Institute of Purchasing Materials Management (SIPMM) PMI on 2 January.

Demand from the electronics and semiconductor segments remained robust, although manufacturers are facing capacity constraints, as well as disruptions from Red Sea diversions.

The diversions have led to longer transit times, higher logistics costs, and delays in supplier deliveries, said Stephen Poh, executive director of the SIPMM.

For Vietnam, although December PMI eased to 53.0 from 53.8 in the previous month, growth remained solid with manufacturers “optimistic” for 2026.

Expansion was also noted in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, with Thailand posting a higher December PMI reading of 57.4 from 56.8 in November, supporting near-term demand growth.

FISCAL STIMULUS TO AID ‘26 GROWTH

Economic stimulus measures are being prepared by various Asian economies amid concerns over weakening demand globally.

Japan has unveiled a yen (Y) 21.3 trillion ($135 billion) package in November 2025 to boost sectors such as AI and semiconductors.

Indonesia, meanwhile, has rolled out temporary tax breaks for labor-intensive sectors such as footwear, textiles and apparel, furniture, leather and leather goods and tourism.

Despite the downgrade, the new target suggests potential upside from Truist’s current price of $49.74, which is trading near its 52-week high of $50.86. InvestingPro data indicates the bank appears undervalued based on its Fair Value assessment.

The downgrade comes as Barclays expects Truist to achieve its 2027 Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) objective of 15%, which falls short of the 16% or higher targeted by most peers in the banking sector. Currently, Truist’s Return on Common Equity stands at 8% for the last twelve months.

Barclays cited concerns about Truist’s revenue growth, which is expected to improve from 2% in 2025 to over 4% in 2026 but may continue to lag competitors, while operating leverage trails peers as the bank funds recent catch-up investments including plans to build 100 new branches and renovate more than 300 others. InvestingPro data shows Truist offers a 4.18% dividend yield and has maintained dividend payments for 53 consecutive years, which could provide some income stability for investors during this investment phase.

The investment bank also highlighted increasing competition in Truist’s Southeast footprint from both existing and newer entrants such as , , , , , and , which are building new branches and actively hiring lenders.

Barclays noted that Truist’s commercial and industrial non-performing assets stood at their post-pandemic high in the third quarter of 2025, though it expects more active share repurchases of $4 billion in 2026 compared to $2.5 billion in 2025 to provide some support for the stock.

In other recent news, Truist Financial has unveiled a significant $10 billion share repurchase program, replacing the previous authorization that had $1.5 billion remaining. This move underscores the company’s commitment to enhancing shareholder value while maintaining robust capital levels. In a separate development, Baird downgraded Truist Financial’s stock rating from Outperform to Neutral, citing limited upside potential, though they acknowledged improvements in profitability due to securities repositioning in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, Truist Financial announced a reduction in its prime lending rate from 7.00% to 6.75%, effective December 11, 2025, impacting interest rates on various lending products.

OpenAI is ramping up its audio capabilities as it expects users will primarily interact with upcoming ChatGPT devices through sound.

The Big Picture: Big Tech companies like Meta and Google are working on AI devices that could replace smartphones, and they all seem to have landed on the same idea: that conversing out loud with chatbots is the innovation that will divorce people from their screens. But that shift would require a major cultural change in how people use technology — especially in public spaces.

Behind The Device: OpenAI wants you to talk out loud… just not to yourself.

OpenAI doesn’t believe the LLM powering ChatGPT’s audio experience is as strong as its text-based one, so it’s restructuring teams to make audio the priority.

The goal, according to The Information, is to make responses more accurate and speed up how quickly the chatbot answers questions… all while feeling like a natural conversation partner.

So far, the company has developed a new model that sounds more natural and “emotive” (read: human) and can provide deeper, more accurate answers.

The next step is advancing it so it can better handle interruptions and speak at the same time as a human user — just as we do when talking to another person.

Closing Thoughts: OpenAI plans to release the new audio model sometime early this year… ideally giving people enough time to adjust to talking to ChatGPT before a device rollout in 2027. Right now, most people interact with the chatbot through text-based prompts — but OpenAI didn’t spend $6.5 billion to acquire iPhone designer Jony Ive’s io just so users could keep tapping a touchscreen. Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman want to replace the iPhone.

It may be OpenAI’s most ambitious bet yet.

The Future: OpenAI’s biggest hurdle in getting people to adopt its ChatGPT devices may be convincing them that talking to a chatbot out loud isn’t a faux pas.

From Invisible To Irresistible: How UGC Helped This Brand Pop Off The Shelf

What if the biggest unlock for your CPG brand isn’t a packaging refresh or a promo blitz — but creators telling the story your audience actually wants to hear? That’s exactly what happened when this everyday grocery staple shifted from traditional ads to a creator-led, UGC-powered strategy built for scale.

Instead of pushing polished product shots, the brand activated creators across food, lifestyle, and everyday routines — pairing premium gifting with seasonal moments and culturally relevant hooks. The result wasn’t just content; it was momentum. Snack boards, game-day recipes, self-care rituals, and kitchen-counter creativity started taking over feeds, delivering 560K+ views, 247K reach, 9K likes, 2K saves, and $58K EMV — all from authentic storytelling that felt like discovery, not advertising.

More importantly, it became repeatable. Mid-tier creators expanded visibility. Micro-influencers added warmth and trust. And with Creator.co managing recruitment, briefs, and delivery, the brand built a scalable content engine — everything from 71K-view recipe videos to 600+ saved snack hacks. As one marketing leader put it, “The team is accessible, easy to work with, and provides frequent updates — all our data was right at our fingertips.”

When UGC becomes the heart of your strategy, your product stops blending in and starts belonging in the lives (and carts) of your consumers.",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/16ad69aa-50a5-4ced-a73d-4d8ece9c0089/oepnai_jan_5.JPG?t=1767577892,N,,2026-01-05 05:14:31.957103

All preconceived ideas about this were wrong after the earthquake occurred in the bank of JPMorgan Chase (a $4 trillion financial institution) with their creation of MONY, a tokenized money market fund which exists on the Ethereum Blockchain, which has rocked the Financial Services industry. They have created a programmable version of this product, making it one of the most significant advancements in technology for traditional banks. As a result of this creation banks now have new thoughts regarding money than they had ever before.

Enter MONY: Cash on the Chain

MONY (My OnChain Net Yield) is a new form of fund that is a departure from traditional institutional funding models. Unlike previous institutional funding models, MONY utilizes a public blockchain (Ethereum), leveraging the bank’s proprietary Kinexys Digital Assets platform.

Investors who meet qualifications for MONY will be able to hold digital tokens representing a fractional ownership position in a collection of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of less than 12 months. The difference between MONY and previous funding models is that due to the programmability of these tokens, they will include on-chain record of the daily dividend payments, and allow for both subscription and redemption using fiat currency and stablecoins. This innovation will allow for near real-time settlement of applications for subscriptions or redemptions, and addresses the longstanding issues associated with T+1 and T+2 timeframes commonly associated with traditional money market funding models.

The Strategic Shift

Money market funds are the unglamorous plumbing of the global financial system, holding over $7 trillion in assets to preserve capital and manage liquidity. For years, this scale made them too important to risk on “experimental” technology.

Nonetheless, with the enactment of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) in July 2025, there was a significant shift in the perceived risk associated with the use of blockchain technology. This legislation gave banks a clear path to starting using stablecoins and tokenized assets in a compliant manner. Banks now have the necessary guidance and framework to begin issuing new products through the blockchain, thus moving JPMorgan out of the sidelines and onto the field.

Two Visions for the Future

JPMorgan’s bold stance is a signal that the gap in ideology on Wall Street continues to grow. On the one hand, as a “cloud-native” business, JPMorgan has chosen to issue tokens directly onto a public blockchain. Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon, on the other hand, have taken a somewhat more reflective and cautious approach.

Earlier this year, the Goldman-BNY alliance launched a joint initiative to tokenize records of existing funds rather than creating blockchain-native funds. In their model, the assets stay in traditional systems while tokens act as digital mirrors.

“There is a divide in these approaches,” notes one fintech analyst. “Some see blockchain as a new financial operating layer—the JPMorgan view—while others see it merely as a faster database that leaves existing control structures intact. Both are progress, but they are building toward very different futures.”

The Gatekeeping Debate

MONY is not an open multi-party DeFi Protocol but rather a highly-controlled access protocol intended for select Qualified Institutional Investors with significant minimum commitments; as a result, some people see MONY as hindering the idea of financial decentralization instead of enabling it.

Some see proof of this with the model that MONY is using because it only allows those who are able to invest large amounts and that those who do are all large banks or corporations, thus there is a danger that MONY is simply replicating the same issues that exist in traditional banking; the supporters of MONY argue that for this model to work at scale, large financial pools will require a specific level of institutional trust. An institution will require a high level of regulatory compliance, custody, and risk management around its investments and therefore will not be able to use a completely open and trustless DeFi protocol.

A Signal to the Boardroom

Rather than being primarily a product launch, the launch of MONY provides both an opportunity for corporate boards and treasury managers to realize that digitizing cash is now inevitable vs possibly. Furthermore, tokenising cash will offer firms opportunities for transferring value with the same ease as transferring information. This will lead to reduced risk in settlement processes and allow firms to release capital previously tied up in bank accounts. Due to the increasing number of firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and State Street, looking at this type of structure, as well as the growing number of firms using on-chain treasury solutions, competitive pressures will increase dramatically in 2026. As the market continues to grow, the speed at which it will impact traditional plumbing systems in daily financing will continue to accelerate.",https://techstory.in/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jpmorgan-mony-fund-e1767556256414.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 09:00:34.659063

The French beauty conglomerate has unveiled two light-powered innovations at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, including a Light Straight + Multi-styler flat iron, which uses near-infrared light technology to straighten and style hair at reduced temperatures, and LED eye masks meant to combat visible signs of under-eye aging.

Both products will launch in 2027 under respective, yet-to-be-confirmed brands within L’Oréal’s portfolio, which includes Lancôme, Vichy, SkinCeuticals and more in skin, and L’Oréal Professionnel, Redken and Color Wow, among others, in hair.

The Light Straight builds on the patented powering L’Oréal Professionnel’s AirLight Pro hair dryer, which L’Oréal unveiled at CES 2024 and has since rolled out to salons in the U.S., Europe and Asia, as well as on Amazon and Ulta Beauty, where the tool sells for $475.

“We’re using the same type of technology to straighten the hair three times faster [than a traditional flat iron], make it two times smoother and use up to 100 degrees less heat,” said Guive Balooch, global vice president, augmented beauty and open innovation at L’Oréal.

The Light Straight features glass plates which never exceed 320 degrees Fahrenheit and work in tandem with the near-infrared technology to style the hair while reducing the risk of heat damage. It can also be maneuvered to create waves and curls.

While the AirLight Pro was developed in partnership with hardware start-up Zuvi, the Light Straight was developed in-house, added the executive.

The LED Eye Masks, developed in partnership with iSmart Developments, deliver red light and near-infrared light treatment in timed, 10-minute sessions. There are 16 LED chips per silicone-based eye mask, totaling 32 LED chips in both.

“Because the material is so thin and so flexible, we can make masks that are targeted to different parts of the face — like the chin, the neck,” said Balooch, adding that L’Oréal is also developing a full-face version of the mask, which features 208 LED chips and “sits on the skin like a sheet mask would.”

LED masks and facial devices have become increasingly popular in recent years, with prominent players including Therabody — which recently signed Kendall Jenner as an ambassador for its $379 TheraFace Mask Glo; Shark Beauty, and Solawave, known for its $169 red light therapy wand.

L’Oréal’s eye masks, which are still prototypes, will mark the company’s first foray into the category. In terms of pricing, the masks “will be within the middle-range of premium products,” said Balooch.",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LOreal-launches.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2026-01-05 05:58:57.854960

The focus is on two things: the official start of construction of the new NVIDIA headquarters in Taiwan and the legendary “trillion-dollar dinner” with the island’s most important suppliers.
With the “Constellation” project, NVIDIA will establish its first global headquarters outside the USA.
Huang himself had already made it clear at Computex that NVIDIA does not regard Taiwan as an extended workbench, but as a strategic center.
NVIDIA knows this, and Jensen Huang knows that trust in Asia is not built by contract, but by presence.","When Jensen Huang travels to Taiwan, it is no longer a courtesy visit. It is a signal. According to reports in the Taiwanese media, the NVIDIA CEO is planning several symbolically and strategically charged appointments this month, which can hardly be read as anything other than a geopolitical and industrial positioning. The focus is on two things: the official start of construction of the new NVIDIA headquarters in Taiwan and the legendary “trillion-dollar dinner” with the island’s most important suppliers.

Let’s start with the sober part. With the “Constellation” project, NVIDIA will establish its first global headquarters outside the USA. The location is the Beitou-Shilin Science Park in Taipei, an area of just under 3.9 hectares that will house several thousand employees in the future. This is not a satellite office, but an institutional anchor. Huang himself had already made it clear at Computex that NVIDIA does not regard Taiwan as an extended workbench, but as a strategic center. In retrospect, the fact that the project stalled for a while due to insurance issues seems more like a technical stumbling block than a political doubt. With Huang’s signature, the launch is now set to go ahead.

However, the real explosive issue is not in the concrete, but at the dinner table. The “trillion-dollar dinner” is more than folklore. When representatives from TSMC, Foxconn, Quanta, Wistron and other partners gather, it’s not about thank-you speeches. It’s about clocking, capacities and trust. NVIDIA has long been operating at the limits of what traditional supply chains can achieve. Every day of delay in CoWoS, packaging or server integration costs millions, and in the age of AI, billions. The timing is no coincidence. Taiwan’s suppliers are currently working on the ramp-up of Blackwell Ultra and are already preparing the next generation, known internally as Rubin. This parallelization is extremely demanding. Anyone who underestimates a bottleneck here risks not only delays in delivery, but also market share. NVIDIA knows this, and Jensen Huang knows that trust in Asia is not built by contract, but by presence.

Taiwan has long been more than just a production location for NVIDIA. It is a neuralgic hub of the global AI infrastructure. Huang himself has repeatedly described the island as one of the most important locations for the company. That may sound diplomatic, but it is factually correct. No modern NVIDIA GPUs without TSMC, no scalable AI systems without the ODMs, no speed without local proximity.

You can dismiss this dinner as a ritual. But you can also read it for what it is, a silent demonstration of power. While other tech companies talk about reshoring and diversification, NVIDIA is tying its partners closer than ever. Not a PR event, but a dependency lived out at eye level. In a world where AI is becoming infrastructure, evenings like this are perhaps more important than any keynote at CES.",https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Jensen.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:27:13.446576

For Amazon, it is AWS. For Amazon and Walmart, it is the fast‑growing world of retail media and data‑driven advertising. One year after Walmart acquired TV manufacturer Vizio, the strategic impact on Walmart Connect is becoming unmistakable. Walmart is rapidly transforming from a traditional retailer into a vertically integrated media company with reach across its 4600 stores, online platforms and, increasingly, the living room screen.

NRF The Big Show 2026 – North America’s leading retail tech event takes place 11-13 January in New York City. Florian Rotberg will be on site to bring invidis and sixteen-nine readers the latest news from the showfloor and the conferences.

The acquisition of Vizio in December 2024 for USD 2.2 billion (invidis report) marked a turning point in the U.S. retail media landscape. Walmart, already one of the country’s largest sellers of TVs through its physical stores, gained not primarily a TV manufacturer but a proprietary smart TV operating system with deeply embedded advertising capabilities. Since then, Roku, long a prominent player in CTV advertising and also rooted in digital signage history through its joined Brightsign heritage, has been losing ground as Walmart pushes its own ecosystem.

The timing could not have been better. The U.S. retail media market grew by around twenty percent in 2025, but Walmart Connect expanded significantly faster. The company reported thirty‑three percent growth in the last quarter alone, driven by online placements, in‑app advertising, in‑store screens and especially connected TV. When including the contribution of Vizio, Walmart’s global advertising business grew by more than fifty percent. The addition of a proprietary Connected TV platform has allowed Walmart to capture new revenue streams from non-endemic like automotive, financial services and quick‑service restaurants. Some of these new clients now rank among the largest spenders on the Walmart DSP.

The strategic value of the Vizio integration becomes clear in how Walmart combines its first‑party shopper data with CTV delivery. Vizio advertisers can target audiences based on verified Walmart shopping behaviour and measure the direct sales impact generated by campaigns shown on Vizio devices.

The company is rolling out the Vizio operating system to its private‑label Onn TV line, a move that could extend the OS’s reach to between a quarter and a third of all U.S. households. Such scale would place Walmart among the most influential CTV platform owners in the market, with a closed ecosystem reaching from hardware to measurement.

Impact on SoC-Platforms

Walmart and Amazon are the most important sales channel for TVs from Samsung, LG & Co. Their most important channel partner becomes now a serious competitor not only for TVs but also new competition for Google Android, Samsung Tizen and LG WebOS and their ambitious Ad-sales goals. The fully integrated Ad business model works tremendously good – according to Walmart Connect, shoppers exposed to CTV ads are twenty‑eight percent more likely to purchase products through Walmart.

The company sees a direct correlation between the number of consumer touchpoints a brand activates and the resulting increase in conversion, which strengthens its commitment to a multi-screen strategy spanning online, in-app, in-store and CTV environments.

Measurement is a central pillar of Walmart’s approach

Over the past year, the retailer has been expanding incremental return on ad spend metrics beyond display and video to include search and other formats. Brands increasingly expect consistent and comparable KPIs across all advertising surfaces, whether inside a Walmart store or on external channels. Walmart now provides closed-loop measurement across a wide array of media partners, including TikTok, Meta, TV networks and bespoke integrations such as a dedicated measurement partnership with Disney. The aim is to ensure that every impression can ultimately be tied back to sales outcomes.

While CTV is currently driving the most momentum, Walmart continues to invest heavily in the long-anticipated frontier of in-store retail media. The company is developing the hardware, adtech and measurement frameworks required to scale in-store advertising beyond pilot implementations. Importantly, Walmart emphasizes contextual relevance: bakery screens will serve food‑related messages, not generic electronics promotions. Brand lift and sales lift across in-store digital signage will become key metrics in what may emerge as the next major wave of U.S. retail media innovation.

Shopper Data is key – also for RMN-experts like Stratacache, Stingray, CRI & Co

US digital signage specialists such as Stratacache, Stingray and CRI face increasing pressure as retail media becomes a fully integrated discipline inside major retail giants. Shopper data has emerged as the decisive competitive advantage – and it is an area where vertically integrated retailers like Walmart set benchmarks that third‑party network operators cannot easily match. Stratacache’s PRN division once pioneered Walmart’s early in‑store media networks, but the era of outsourcing has ended for the world’s largest retailer. Today, Walmart controls its own retail media stack end‑to‑end, from data to measurement to CTV integration, leaving external vendors with far fewer opportunities at the very top of the market.

Across North America’s grocery, pharmacy and DIY sectors, however, the landscape looks different. While most supermarket groups now run internal retail media organisations responsible for monetisation and data strategy, the design, rollout and technical operation of in‑store networks remain largely in the hands of digital signage specialists. Stratacache and Stingray dominate these large‑scale deployments, but competition is intensifying as CRI, Wovenmedia and others position themselves as full‑service RMN partners for retailers that lack Walmart‑level resources. The battle for retail media network leadership beyond Amazon and Walmart is therefore shifting to supermarket and DIY chains, where operational expertise, flexible infrastructure and the ability to align with retailer‑owned shopper data will define the winners.",https://invidis.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-12-AUS-Walmart-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:27:34.359793

They stop you mid-scroll. According to Indian Tech & Infra, the Tata Group–owned brand sold 220 T-shirts, 60 pairs of denims, 250 fragrances, and 330 lipsticks every single minute last year. Let that sink in. While most fashion brands are busy chasing trends and attention, Zudio was quietly ringing up bills at a pace few expected.

By the end of FY25, the Mumbai-based retailer crossed the $1 billion revenue mark, a milestone many global fast-fashion players are still trying to crack in India. Even more telling? The brand managed to double its store count in just two years. No overnight miracle. No sudden viral moment. Just steady, deliberate growth.

Advt

Market analysts say this kind of scale doesn’t happen by accident. It’s the result of a very clear strategy - one that understands how India actually shops.

Instead of building hype, the brand built reach. While many brands poured money into celebrity endorsements and flashy launches, it focused on opening stores where people actually live and shop. Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities became its stronghold, tapping into a customer who wants to dress well but also wants prices that feel reasonable, not aspirational.

And that formula worked. Fast.

The brand’s racks move quickly because the clothes make sense. They’re trend-aware without being intimidating. Affordable without feeling throwaway. Fashion you can pick up without planning for it, sometimes even while doing your grocery run.

Of course, there’s debate around this success. Some critics say the brand’s rise proves India is still driven by volume, not premium fashion. But others see it differently. They believe it cracked middle-class psychology, the balance between wanting to look current and needing to stay practical. Once that balance is right, scale follows almost naturally.

Financially, the growth came with trade-offs. Trent, the Tata Group company behind Zudio, reported strong revenue gains even as margins tightened - a common story when a brand expands this aggressively. Hundreds of new stores mean higher costs today, but also deeper roots for tomorrow.

Advt

What’s interesting is how the brand now sits almost shoulder to shoulder with global fast-fashion giants, not by copying them, but by doing something very Indian. Keeping things simple. Keeping prices honest. And showing up everywhere.

Selling hundreds of products every minute isn’t just a flex. It’s proof that an Indian brand, built on clarity and consistency, can compete at scale without shouting about it.

And sometimes, that’s the smartest fashion move of all.

By Nate Allen

FAYETTEVILLE - Between a new/old warmup revived from the 1960s to a complete team for the first time, Eric Musselman promises a new look to his Arkansas Razorbacks for their official men’s basketball season opener tonight off their recent two exhibition games.

At 7 tonight at Walton Arena on the Razorbacks Radio Network and Internet video available on SEC Network Plus, Arkansas opens its campaign against the 1-0 Macon, Ga. based Mercer University Bears of the Southern Conference.

Kamani Johnson, the transfer power forward via the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, missed both exhibition victories over East Central (Okla.) University and the University of North Texas because of an injured wrist.

Starting sophomore letterman center Jaylin Williams missed the Oct. 30 UNT game with back spasms but has practiced daily since the Razorbacks resumed drill Monday after taking Sunday off.

Trey Wade, the graduate transfer power forward via Wichita State, missed nearly all of preseason including the exhibition against ECU with a knee injury but did log 16:46 vs. UNT without ill effects. All three should be available tonight, Musselman said.

“We’re healthier than we’ve been say in the last two months,” Musselman said. “So that’s a positive that we do have the injured guys back in the fold.”

Johnson, practicing with the Hogs since last Dec. 19 signing as a redshirting transfer, is especially ready to play a Razorbacks game.

“I’ve been sitting for probably around a year or so,”Johnson said to media last Friday. “So I couldn’t even put it into words how excited I am to step on the court and finally be a part of what it is to be an Arkansas Razorback. I’m super excited about it.”

Musselman said against UNT he had figured on a 5-minutes stint each half at most for Wade. He said he was surprised not by just how long Wade played but how effectively. The Hogs played plus 15 for Wade’s minutes though Musselman said Wade really doesn’t know his new team’s plays since he had been unable to practice them.

“Maybe that surprised me a little,” Wade said of the knee holding up for a nearly 17-minutes debut. 'I already knew once he put me on the floor it was going to be hard to take me out. I know how to get in the game and be productive regardless of if I really know the plays or not. It's just about being a basketball player.”

In tonight’s pregame, Razorbacks fans will see if their players new and returning can drill like Harlem Globetrotters.

Musselman said he’s reviving the Globetrotters like pregame warmup that his father, the late Bill Musselman, first invoked coaching Ashland College in the 1960s and brought to the University of Minnesota. Eric also used it for awhile coaching the University of Nevada.

Musselman said his father planned it to entertain the fans but certainly to benefit the players.

“He wanted his players to have great fundamentals handling the basketball,” Musselman said. “He wanted his team to be locked in and the warmup and helped with skills, as well. Nine of our players have learned to juggle three basketballs. Most of our team can all spin the ball on their finger. A lot of two-ball dribbling. Just a lot of skill stuff that we’ve worked on.”

Power forwards Wade and Johnson don’t seem the 3-balls in the air type but said they will surprise.

“You’ve got to get to the seats early and then you can find out what all I can do and what all the team can do,” Johnson said.

In the meantime, focus hasn’t been lost on Mercer returning three key starters from last season’s 18-11 Bulldogs and adding graduate transfer forward Jalen Johnson experienced both in the ACC and SEC.

Guard Neftali Alvarez, swingman James Glisson and forward Felipe Haase are three key returnees and joined Johnson and 6-6 Shawn Walker opening Wednesday’s 93-61 victory over Fort Valley State.

Alvarez led with 19 points. Johnson scored 12. Reserves Shannon Grant and Kamar Robertson scored 17 and 13.

“Alvarez, is a very, very good ball-handler,” Musselman said. “Very crafty. Loves to dribble drive right. Has got a great spin dribble. Really good in transition. One of the best guards in their league if not the best guard in their league. No. 22 (Felipe) Haase played for the Chilean national team. He can really shoot the ball. He plays the 5-spot for them. He’s a trail pick-and-pop guy. Johnson played for Tennessee and Wake Forest, a transfer at 6-6, 6-7. A very, very good 3-point shooter. Good defender because of length. Last night they made 13 threes. So this is a team that can really, really shoot the basketball. Glisson, is an offensive rebounding, high-energy player. Grant is a big body, physical who had 17 points. Those guys in particular are who we're focused on right now.”

Musselman has tinkered with lineups during the exhibitions.

In this story, we highlight sets of wheels that’ll get you gunning into the new year with poise and power.

Corvette Stingray

Who’s to say you shouldn’t start the year with a red-line roar? The arrival of the Corvette Stingray in Singapore last year marked a significant moment for the city’s high-octane landscape, as one of the most storied sports cars in the US finally took its place on local tarmac.

Seven decades of Corvette heritage sit behind the latest Stingray, yet its focus is firmly forward. A mid- mounted 6.2-litre V8 delivers 495 horses, sending the car from nought to 100km/h in 2.9 seconds and on to a top speed of 312km/h. The standard Z51 Performance Package adds track-tuned suspension, performance exhaust, larger brakes, and Michelin Pilot Sport 4S ZP tyres.

Visually, the Stingray expresses speed in sculpted form. Its canopy- forward stance draws inspiration from F-22 and F-35 fighter jets, as well as Formula One cars, giving it a low, wide, purposeful silhouette. A glass rear hatch puts the engine on display, while inside, a hand-wrapped leather cockpit cradles the driver like a fighter jet seat. The cabin is enhanced with a Bose Performance Series audio system and practical features, including a front suspension lift for navigating city streets and dual trunks spacious enough for golf bags.

Corvette

Aston Martin DB12

Few statements feel as decisive as receiving the keys to a DB12. Billed as the first of a new generation of Aston Martin sports cars, it ushers in a fresh chapter for the marque and for the DB bloodline: an ultra-luxury super-tourer that elevates the grand tourer idea by several notches.

Under the sculpted bonnet lies a hand-built 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8, tuned to deliver 680PS and 800Nm of torque. It covers the century sprint in 3.6 seconds and reaches a top speed north of 320km/h. New-generation adaptive dampers, an electronic rear differential, and bespoke 21-inch Michelin Pilot Sport 5 S tyres give the DB12 remarkable breadth, from supple and refined in GT mode to taut and alive in Sport and Sport+ when the road opens up.

The exterior is a study in renewal, rendered in metal. A wider stance, more muscular surfacing, and an all-new front end give the DB12 an assertive, almost architectural presence, framed by new LED headlights and a reshaped front grille. It is also the latest Aston Martin sports car to wear the newest evolution of the brand’s wings, a detail that signals a broader design reset.

Inside, the refresh extends to a driver-focused cockpit, combining hand-stitched leather and modern quilting with the brand’s in-house infotainment system, high-resolution displays, and an optional Bowers & Wilkins audio set-up.

Through Q by Aston Martin, owners can use the DB12 as a starting point to commission anything from a single distinguishing detail to a fully bespoke specification. With a new palette of colours, materials, and finishes, the possibilities are extensive, allowing the car to mirror whatever chapter they are stepping into.

Launched in the same year Aston Martin marks its 110th anniversary (and 75 years of DB models), the DB12 feels like a line in the sand, a signal that the next era has arrived. A fitting way to embrace renewal might well be committing to a car that is purpose- built for new horizons.",https://robbreport.com.sg/storage/2025/12/The_New_Aston_Martin_DB12_15-1-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 22:58:51.517725

The Philadelphia Eagles needed to beat the Washington Commanders in Week 18 and get some out-of-town help to clinch the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs for a second year in a row.

But they were foiled Sunday in the regular-season finale by the most unlikely character: third-string Commanders quarterback Josh Johnson — a 39-year-old journeyman who hadn’t won an NFL start since 2018.

Washington’s 24-17 road win left the Eagles as the No. 3 seed in the NFC. Philadelphia (11-6) will face the sixth-seeded San Francisco 49ers (12-5) in the opening round. It will be a rematch of the 2023 NFC Championship Game, a 31-7 Eagles win.

Because the Detroit Lions upset the Chicago Bears on Sunday, the Eagles would have been the No. 2 seed had they beaten the Commanders (5-12).

But with the NFC East title already assured, the Eagles made it clear that wasn’t their priority. They started backup quarterback Tanner McKee and rested starting QB Jalen Hurts, tight end Dallas Goedert, wide receiver A.J. Brown, running back Saquon Barkley and a host of other mainstays on both sides of the ball. Wide receiver DeVonta Smith exited early after reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the season. The Commanders sat left tackle Laremy Tunsil and started Johnson for a second consecutive game after injuries to Jayden Daniels and Marcus Mariota.

McKee finished 21-for-40 passing for 241 yards and a touchdown, and he was sacked three times and threw an interception. The Eagles’ three fourth-quarter drives ended in a punt and two turnovers on downs.

Johnson, meanwhile, brought the Commanders back from a 17-10 fourth-quarter deficit with two touchdown drives, scoring the decisive touchdown on a third-and-goal scramble from the 1-yard line with 2:32 left.

49ers up next

The Eagles spoiled an opportunity to secure the No. 2 seed, and they’re now preparing to host the 49ers. Had the Eagles jumped to the No. 2 seed, they would have hosted the Green Bay Packers, who have lost four in a row. The Eagles did not play the 49ers this season. They last played in the 2023 regular season, when the 49ers’ 42-19 victory avenged their loss in the NFC Championship Game months earlier. If the Eagles beat the 49ers and the Bears beat the Packers, the Eagles would travel to Chicago in the divisional round. With the No. 2 seed, the Eagles would instead have hosted the Bears. The Eagles could still host a divisional-round game with a win and a Bears loss. The Eagles knew the stakes entering the game and favored rest — what they viewed as a manufactured bye — entering the postseason. — Zach Berman, Eagles beat writer

Eagles backups can’t hold

An Eagles defense that fielded mostly backups could not deny the Commanders from scoring touchdowns on two consecutive goal-to-go scenarios to finish the game. When Johnson scrambled for that 1-yard touchdown to set the final score, the only Eagles regulars involved were along the defensive line. Jalyx Hunt, Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo and Nolan Smith started. Hunt capped a second season in which he substantially improved by jumping a Johnson pass for his third interception of the season. Hunt led the Eagles in both interceptions and sacks (6.5) in 2025.

The performance of the Eagles’ secondary once again revealed its lack of depth. Apart from his interception, Johnson was 14-for-22 passing for 131 yards and a touchdown. The Commanders converted six of 11 third downs, converted their only fourth-down situation and scored three touchdowns on their four red-zone trips. Backup defensive backs Jakorian Bennett, Mac McWilliams and Kelee Ringo were each flagged for pass interference. (Bennett was flagged twice.) The Eagles are far more formidable under Vic Fangio when playing at full strength. The playoffs will reveal how beneficial it was for the starters to receive a rest. — Brooks Kubena, Eagles beat writer

McKee’s uneven day

McKee had an uneven audition for the rest of the NFL and couldn’t deliver the Eagles a victory as he did in the season finale last year. McKee, the Eagles’ third-year backup quarterback, has been a subject of intrigue in Philadelphia throughout his Eagles career. The interception was especially costly, coming at the Commanders’ 20-yard line with a chance to score. He also couldn’t lead the Eagles on a game-tying drive late in the game. The caveat is McKee, in his only start of the year, played with reserves against the Commanders’ starting defense, so his performance might have looked different had he played with the Eagles’ starters. McKee excelled in relief last season and followed it up with a sterling outing in the preseason, prompting curiosity about his future with the team. McKee has one year left on his contract and there could be outside interest from teams seeking a potential starting quarterback. But that case would have been stronger with a win and gaudier statistics. — Berman

Washington will pick seventh

Washington finally got a win, but it came at a cost: The Commanders fell to No. 7 in the draft order after entering the game at No. 6 (courtesy of the Cleveland Browns’ earlier win over the Cincinnati Bengals in addition to other results). — Nicki Jhabvala, Commanders beat writer

Johnson’s moment

Sunday was for Johnson. He threw his first touchdown since 2021 and scored his first rushing touchdown since 2018. — Jhabvala

Washington’s mistakes persist

Washington’s defense needs so much work. The Commanders continue to miss routine tackles, continue to give up easy yards in the middle of the field, continue to struggle with covering tight ends and continue to make backup quarterbacks look like seasoned veterans. Unlike last season, when they seemingly mastered situational ball, the Commanders often appeared sloppy and inattentive this season. And safety Quan Martin’s rough season was capped by losing the start to Jeremy Reaves. Martin was benched twice earlier for mistakes in games. This was the first time he was benched as a starter. Martin entered this game with an average of 18.7 yards allowed per catch, the highest average among safeties with at least 500 coverage snaps. He had allowed a 151.8 passer rating when targeted in coverage. — Jhabvala",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/04194756/GettyImages-2254675397-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-04 22:58:46.977749

Investors seem to be cautiously rewarding these health and tech pushes, with Walmart’s 90 day share price return of 9.8% and 1 year total shareholder return of 25.4% pointing to steady, not euphoric, momentum.

If Walmart’s moves have you thinking about where else growth and execution might line up, it could be worth exploring as a fresh hunting ground for ideas.

With shares up strongly over the past year and trading only modestly below analyst targets, the key question now is whether Walmart is still mispriced or if the market is already accounting for years of health and AI driven growth.

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 5.6% Undervalued

With Walmart closing at $112.76 against a widely followed fair value near $119, the dominant narrative sees modest upside still on the table.

Expansion of high margin business streams Walmart Connect (advertising, up 31 46% globally), marketplace, and Walmart+ memberships (global advertising up 46%, membership income up 15%) is diversifying Walmart's income base beyond retail, gradually transforming the company's profit mix and resulting in structurally higher net margins and earnings over time.

Want to see why a mature retailer is being modeled with the kind of margin and earnings profile usually reserved for premium platforms? The most popular narrative quietly rewrites Walmart’s profit mix, leans on steady top line growth, and bakes in a forward earnings multiple that many investors would not expect for this sector. Curious which assumptions have to hold for that valuation to work?

Result: Fair Value of $119.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, persistent e commerce losses and rising wage and claims costs could crimp margins and challenge the idea that higher tech driven profitability is locked in.

Another Way to Look at Value

On earnings based valuation, Walmart looks stretched. Its price to earnings ratio of 39.2x sits well above the Consumer Retailing industry at 22.8x, the peer average at 26x, and even its own 38x fair ratio. This implies limited margin for error if growth stumbles.

Jan 04, 2026 Share

AXA UK veteran Dougie Barnett (pictured) is retiring, following a career spanning more than four decades across underwriting, risk management and loss prevention.

Barnett most recently served as the company's director of mid-market and customer risk management. He began his insurance career in 1982 with Sun Alliance's underwriting team in Glasgow. Five years later, he moved to New Zealand Insurance, where he specialised in risk management.

Early challenges

Barnett joined AXA UK in July 2001 as a risk surveyor in Glasgow and was promoted later that year to UK property risk technical manager. One of his earliest and most significant challenges in the role came in the aftermath of the collapse of Independent Insurance, which triggered a severe capacity shortage in the food manufacturing sector. Barnett led AXA UK’s response, developing a structured risk matrix that enabled the insurer to re-enter the market and support brokers placing complex food sector risks at a time of widespread disruption.

Barnett also represented AXA UK on a number of Association of British Insurers (ABI) strategic programmes. Through this work, he engaged with government departments and regulators on issues including the use of composite panels in food risks, as well as the broader economic impact of fire and flood losses and their knock-on effects on mortgage availability and property lending.

Building partnerships

In 2004, Barnett launched AXA UK's first building valuation service in partnership with Cunningham Lindsay, responding to persistent underinsurance issues in larger commercial property portfolios. He was promoted to lead AXA UK's risk management team in 2006, where he oversaw the development of technical standards and broker-facing risk support.

In later years, Barnett established the company's global loss prevention board and helped develop the insurer's approach to emerging risks, including green buildings, sustainability-related property exposures, electric vehicles and sustainable transport. He also became a founder member of the AXA Group Global Risk Management Board, contributing to global strategy, policy development and talent programmes across Europe and Asia.

Barnett also served as a regular media spokesperson for AXA UK, providing industry commentary across trade and national outlets on property risk, loss prevention and emerging risk issues.

With IBM now trading just shy of analyst targets after a powerful multi year run, investors face a key question: is there still upside left in the hybrid cloud and AI story, or is future growth already priced in?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 1% Undervalued

With IBM closing at $291.5 against a narrative fair value near $293.9, the storyline assumes only a slim remaining upside from here.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $281.316 for International Business Machines based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $350.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $198.0.

Curious how modest revenue growth, rising margins and a rich future earnings multiple can still point to upside from today’s price, despite tight projections?

Result: Fair Value of $293.89 (ABOUT RIGHT)

However, that story could fray if macro uncertainty slows consulting demand or if Red Hat’s consumption growth undershoots, which would challenge IBM’s mid single digit revenue ambitions.

But it was Porter who led the way with an efficient game-high-tying 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.
I’m sure he’d disagree with me completely, which is OK, but we won a lot of games doing it that way.","Brooklyn’s Michael Porter Jr. returned from illness just in time to face the team that traded him over the summer. And he made that reunion a winning one.

Porter led the Nets to a 127-115 victory over the Nuggets before a sellout crowd of 17,548 at Barclays Center on Sunday.

It snapped a three-game skid, and was especially sweet for Porter, who won the 2023 title with the Nuggets only to be salary dumped last summer by Denver.

“I was excited for that first match really since I’ve been traded, the way that all went down,” said Porter. “I was looking forward to playing against those guys. For sure it’s been circled on my calendar for a minute. I probably got a little bit more nervous for this one than a lot of other games. So it was fun.”

The Nets (11-22) had a season-high six players muster at least 13 points as they shot 50.6 percent and 14-for-33 from deep. But it was Porter who led the way with an efficient game-high-tying 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.

“I think it means a lot to him because he’s been there for a long time, and he’s got a lot of people they shared the locker room for a long time,” Jordi Fernández said of Porter, whom he spent four seasons with as a Denver assistant. “I’m very happy for the group. I’m very happy for Michael.”

A starter on the Nuggets team that won the 2023 title, Porter nevertheless took a backseat to the two-man game of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. The Nets dealt Cam Johnson for Porter and Denver’s unprotected 2032 first-round pick, a swap that was initially panned but is looking more and more like a Brooklyn steal.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS

Entering Sunday, Porter was the only qualified player in the East averaging at least 25 points and seven rebounds, and one of five in the entire league, joining Jokic, Luka Doncic, Lauri Markkanen and Deni Avdija. More to the point, the Nets are winless without him (0-6), but 11-16 with him — winning eight of his last 11.

With Jokic sidelined by a hyperextended left knee, and Johnson out with a bone bruise in his right, Murray poured in 27 points and 16 assists, while Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 26.

The Nets had more than enough to overcome that, Porter’s production backed by forward Noah Clowney (20 points) and Day’Ron Sharpe. The latter filled in admirably for starting center Nic Claxton with 17 points, six rebounds, four assists, three steals and just a single turnover.

“Well, coming in here, I told everybody we locked in,” said Sharpe. “So, we just wanted to rally as a team to help get the Dub for him.”

Brooklyn was clinging to a tenuous 63-56 lead after Murray found Peyton Watson underneath 1:51 into the second half. But they ripped off an extended 21-10 run over the next five minutes, including the final seven unanswered points to seize control of the game. They never gave the lead back.

The Nets hit eight of nine shots in the blitz, including all four from 3-point range. Egor Dëmin had five points and two assists in the game-deciding run, including the final dagger off a Porter feed to make it 84-66 with 5:10 left in the third.

Brooklyn built the lead to 19 and never let it get below double digits, seeing the game out behind Porter.

“He’s got a lot of freedom here. This trade was good for everybody. He won a championship with us. He’s one of the main reasons we did it,” said Nuggets coach David Adelman, who was an assistant alongside Fernández. “Any time you win the whole thing, the role was appropriate. Michael, we know how talented he is.

“Mike has this ability, he always has, but for us, he sacrificed…Our two-man game has been successful, and him in the corner with Aaron Gordon in the dunker spot, was quite a thing. Michael, I thought we used him in the right way. I’m sure he’d disagree with me completely, which is OK, but we won a lot of games doing it that way. It’s cool to see him have some more freedom here under Jordi.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-jzemcesi3-1767570105642.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767552132&w=1200,N,,2026-01-04 20:58:33.076892

Tax reform is meaningless unless it is aligned with tax collection.","Philip Maguire, CPA, CA, is a principal at Glenidan Consultancy Ltd. His practice focuses on internal controls over financial reporting for a number of publicly listed companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

THERE HAS been a lot of attention recently on tax reform. There are few issues that unite Canadians so much as when we complain about how much we pay in taxes.

While reform is important, unfortunately there is not much attention paid to tax enforcement or collection. How will reform help matters if we won’t pursue offenders? Why aren’t we applying the existing laws? Why aren’t Canadian politicians, tax experts and the public insisting that offenders are paying their fair share of taxes?

There are many misconceptions about taxes. Let’s focus our attention on those who offend rather than those who comply.

Some Uncomfortable Truths

An uncomfortable truth is that the Income Tax Act (the Act), at over 3,700 pages, is designed to be confusing. Despite the odd public pronouncement denouncing the complexities of the Act there is little appetite for reform once you realize who benefits from the status quo.

Rules are easy to break when there are so many exceptions. The biggest beneficiaries of today’s confusing Act are multinational corporations and wealthy individuals. Whenever wealthy individuals, from Mr. Bezos to Mr. Balsillie to Mr. Buffet, are challenged about their tax avoidance schemes they roll out the standard defence: “we are in compliance with all of the rules and regulations.” And many lawyers and accountants oppose simplification of the Act. What better way to increase billable hours?

Another Myth

Many pundits argue that lower tax rates encourage businesses to invest. This is debatable as there are many other factors to consider. However, we know that lower tax rates encourage multinational corporations and wealthy individuals to shift assets and income to lower tax jurisdictions, which is not the same as investing in these jurisdictions. Wealth has no loyalty, and limited ties, to its host country.

Do lower tax rates help the economy?

Let’s examine Ireland, which is often lauded by pundits who advocate for lower corporate tax rates in Canada.

A few years ago Microsoft Corporation transferred its licensing rights to Microsoft Ireland. Microsoft Ireland in turn charged Microsoft Canada a royalty so that revenues were eliminated in Canada but recorded in Ireland. An Irish tax rate of 12.5% versus Canada’s tax rate of 26.1% is tax avoidance and does not encourage investment in Ireland or Canada.

And you would think that the Irish State, in the example above, would be pleased with the extra tax revenue. Think again. In 2016 the European Commission (EC) pursued Apple Inc. for offshore profit shifting and tax avoidance. The EC announced in 2024 that Apple owed the Irish State 13 billion euro including penalties and interest. Not surprisingly Apple appealed the initial ruling of the EC.

What was surprising was that the Irish State rejected this significant tax windfall and joined forces with Apple against the EC. If Canada enacted lower corporate taxes would we too fall into the trap of appeasing a large employer such as Apple?

More Avoidance

In 2008 the Internal Revenue Service in the US compared the Forbes 400 annual listing of wealthy individuals to amounts declared by these individuals when they died. Approximately half of the wealth of these individuals was declared, which suggests a significant shield on inheritance taxes. The type of tax that is easy to apply to the population, such as income tax and sales taxes, is not as easy to apply to wealthy people.

Avoidance Closer to Home

Canadians for Tax Fairness reported last year that Canada’s largest corporations and wealthiest families have transferred $682 Billion to tax havens. They note that 75% of companies listed on the S&P/TSX 60 have at least one subsidiary in a tax haven, including all of the big Canadian banks and insurance companies, Shopify and Cenovus. In 2024 these 60 companies avoided $7 Billion in taxes.

Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) is one of the biggest offenders when it comes to tax avoidance. Brookfield has more subsidiaries in tax havens than any other company on the S&P/TSX60.

Canadians For Tax Fairness, in October 2022, concluded that Brookfield had the largest tax gap, of $6 billion, in Canada between 2017 and 2021. Most of Brookfield’s operating businesses are carried out in Bermuda. Brookfield’s effective tax rate has been below Canada’s statutory tax rate in nine of the last ten years and, in five of those years, below 13% (according to S&P Global Market Intelligence). Brookfield stated in a recent proxy circular: “Brookfield and our perpetual affiliates are in full compliance with all applicable tax laws …”.

Why not align reform with collection?

Wouldn’t effective tax collection ease the strain of federal and provincial budget deficits? Since wealth leaks to the lowest tax jurisdiction, the Group of Twenty (G20) established a Global Minimum Corporate Tax Rate. The goal of this effort is to overhaul the manner in which large multinational corporations are taxed and to align the taxation of the digital economy based on location of sales rather than headquarters.

Tax reform is meaningless unless it is aligned with tax collection. Let’s hope that the moral obligation to pay our fair share of taxes spurs tax reform, and simplification of the Act, in a meaningful direction.",https://cdn.agilitycms.com/canadian-accountant/Tax-Reform-VI-660px.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 21:58:54.516036

The gist: OpenAI is reportedly accelerating its audio AI roadmap to support its upcoming screenless hardware device designed by Jony Ive.

Key details: The company targets a Q1 2026 release for a new full-duplex voice model, with the hardware device following in early 2027.

Why it matters: This aggressive timeline contrasts with major delays at Google and Apple, who have pushed their next-gen assistants to Spring 2026.

Context: Achieving seamless, interruption-tolerant voice interaction is the critical technical hurdle for ambient computing devices to succeed.

OpenAI is reportedly accelerating its audio AI roadmap to support its upcoming screenless hardware. For its upcoming high-fidelity voice model designed to handle complex, real-time interruptions, the company is now targeting a Q1 2026 release.

Laying the necessary groundwork for the AI device being developed with Jony Ive, the former Apple design chief, this software sprint targets an early 2027 hardware launch. Such a fast-paced schedule contrasts with major delays at rivals Google and Apple, who have pushed their own updates to Spring 2026.

The Software Sprint: A New Foundation for Voice

Reports indicate the company has unified its engineering, product, and research teams to focus on a single vertical for audio development. By unifying these departments, OpenAI aims to produce a model capable of full duplex communication by the first quarter of 2026.

Current voice assistants typically require a pause before processing input, creating a turn-taking dynamic that feels unnatural. A reported by The Information, OpenAI targets the ability to speak simultaneously with the user and handle interruptions without latency.

Organize: Prompts in folders with tags, favorites, and fast search.

Automate: Run multi-step chains in Auto, Manual, or Paste mode across all major AI chats.

Control: Keep everything private: data stays in your browser, with import/export and version history.

Framing the upcoming device as a fundamental shift in user interaction, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted, “I think we have the opportunity here to kind of completely reimagine what it means to use a computer.”

Moving from active command input to passive, ambient interaction requires near-zero latency. While the gpt-realtime launch in August 2025 reduced costs by 20%, it maintained the standard request-response architecture.

To demonstrate the baseline capabilities that the new model aims to surpass, OpenAI previously released benchmarks for its current technology.

Supporting a device without visual feedback requires the upcoming model to exceed the 82.8% reasoning score on the Big Bench Audio evaluation achieved by the current version.

The Hardware Endgame: Jony Ive’s Ambient Ambition

Serving as the critical dependency for OpenAI’s consumer hardware ambitions, the software roadmap aligns directly with the device timeline. Developed in collaboration with former Apple design chief Jony Ive, the device is now expected to launch in approximately 12 months.

Refining the confirmed device timeline provided by Altman in November 2025, the new estimate narrows the window from a broader “less than two years.”

According to reports, the OpenAI device will reportedly eschew screens entirely, relying on the new audio model as its primary interface. Previous attempts at this form factor, such as the Humane AI Pin, failed largely due to slow response times and connection errors.

To address these specific performance bottlenecks, the company has reportedly adopted a staggered release strategy. The updated audio model will reportedly debut first in the opening quarter of the year, establishing the necessary low-latency infrastructure.

This software foundation will then pave the way for the hardware itself, which is now projected to ship in approximately 12 months, placing the likely release window in early 2027.

Internally, the project has absorbed significant talent, including key designers from Apple. Developers on the hardware team are betting that the new audio model will solve the latency issues that plagued earlier screenless devices.

Google and Apple and the Voice Assistant Race

OpenAI’s primary competitors are also addressing quality control issues. Google has officially confirmed delaying the sunset of Google Assistant in favor of Gemini Live on mobile devices until March 2026.

User feedback indicating that the Gemini-based replacement lacked the reliability of the legacy Google Assistant for basic tasks necessitated the decision. Citing the need for a seamless transition rather than a forced upgrade, executives opted to delay the rollout.

Apple, which is lacking substantially in terms of AI capabilities, has pushed the release of its “Siri V2” overhaul to a Spring 2026 target window following a eadership shakeup.",https://winbuzzer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/openai-logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:59:35.484620

By the time the consensus catches up, the biggest opportunities — and risks — are usually already in motion.

In today’s Sunday Digest takeover, our technology expert Luke Lango lays out a case for why AI isn’t just transforming technology or markets — it’s reshaping the labor economy itself.

Luke connects history, data, and real-world corporate behavior to show why this moment feels different, and why the traditional relationship between productivity and wages is breaking down. Just as important, he explains what investors and workers can do now to adapt — before this shift becomes impossible to ignore.

And if you want to go deeper into how to position for this transformation, Luke recently broke down the government-backed AI buildout and the specific companies he believes are best positioned to benefit in a special broadcast. You can watch the replay and access the free briefing right here.

I’ll let Luke take it from here.

Have a good weekend,

Jeff Remsburg

In 1811, as England’s Industrial Revolution was gaining momentum, a group of textile workers decided to fight back.

Led by the mythical “General Ludd” of Sherwood Forest, what began as a concentrated movement in central England quickly spread across the nation. Traditional workers took hammers to the stocking frames and power looms – the machines erasing their jobs, their wages, and centuries of hard-won craft.

They weren’t irrational or anti-progress. They were simply watching their livelihoods evaporate in real time, and they understood that no one was coming to help them.

And it took generations of political struggle to rebuild something resembling dignity for working people.

Right now, a similar story is unfolding. This time, AI is the existential threat.

While investors are worrying about if Big Tech is spending too much on AI, the ground beneath our feet – the very foundation of how we earn a living – is turning into quicksand.

The biggest risk we face isn’t a bear market or even a crash in the Nasdaq.

It’s the permanent devaluation of human labor…

The Iceberg Index: The Truth About AI Job Loss in America

The latest research shows just how far this displacement has already advanced beneath the surface.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, partnering with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, recently released what it calls the “Iceberg Index” – and it’s terrifyingly blunt.

The study’s models suggest that roughly 12% of existing U.S. jobs could be replaced by AI right now.

That’s 1 in 9 people whose economic output can be matched by a software subscription that doesn’t need health insurance and doesn’t take bathroom breaks.

We aren’t even talking about what happens when the AI further matures.

When an AI agent can not only write the email but also plan the project and execute the code migration without human intervention, the need for human “managers” in the middle evaporates.

We are already seeing the results…

HP Inc. (HPQ) just announced it is cutting up to 6,000 jobs by 2028 to “fund AI investment.”

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) cut 12,000 corporate roles earlier this year, explicitly stating that automation means those jobs aren’t coming back.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) is undergoing its biggest corporate layoff ever.

This isn’t recessionary. This is a capital pivot. Companies are trading variable-cost, high-maintenance human workers for fixed-cost, exponentially improving silicon ones.

AI Is Breaking the Link Between Productivity and Wages

For the last century, as technology improved, productivity went up. As productivity went up, wages did, too. A rising tide lifted all boats, even if some boats were lifted higher than others.

But AI is breaking that link.

When a company deploys an AI system that allows it to double its output without hiring a single new employee, where does that extra value go?

It does not go to the remaining workers. It goes to the company’s bottom line, and then to dividends, buybacks, and a higher share price.

And that doesn’t even take an economic downturn into account.

Right now, we have historically low unemployment (around 4%). The economy is showing cracks but is still fairly stable. And yet, companies are aggressively automating.

Imagine what happens in a recession.

Economists call it the “cleansing effect.” When revenue dips, companies are forced to cut costs and jobs mercilessly.

The recession will be the accelerant. The recovery will be jobless.

Workers Must Shift From Labor to Capital to Survive the AI Era

So, if the value of labor is crashing and the value of capital is skyrocketing, the solution is uncomfortably simple.

You need to stop thinking like a laborer and start thinking like a capitalist.

This brings us to the “stock bubble.” You might be worried that Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is overpriced at its current valuation. Fair enough.

But if you have zero exposure to the companies building the infrastructure of the future, you are betting your entire financial existence on your ability to outwork software that doubles in ability every 18 months.

That is a terrible bet.

The only true hedge against the devaluation of your labor is to own stock in the companies that are benefiting from labor devaluation. You need to be on the receiving end of that wealth transfer.

If the AI boom continues, these companies will generate unprecedented cash flows. If the “AI bubble” pops, the tech doesn’t go away. It just gets cheaper for companies to deploy, accelerating the labor displacement even faster.

In either scenario, capital wins.

How to Protect Yourself From AI Job Loss: A Two-Part Strategy

Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Great advice. I’ll just take this spare $3 million and buy a diversified portfolio of AI infrastructure stocks so I can live off the dividends when my job is automated.”

Indeed, replacing an entire salary with capital returns requires a massive amount of money that most of us simply don’t have.

So, you need a two-part “barbell strategy” for survival.

Immediate Financial Exposure: You cannot afford to sit this market out because it’s “frothy.” You need exposure to the picks and shovels of this gold rush – the chip designers, hyperscale cloud providers, foundational model companies, etc.

Become ‘Human Capital’: Until you have enough capital to retire, your labor is still your primary asset. You have to upgrade it.

The labor market is bifurcating into two categories: commodity labor versus agency labor.

You need to be the latter. Stop writing copy. Start orchestrating the brand voice that AI brings to life.

The people who will thrive in the transition period aren’t just the ones owning Nvidia stock. They are the ones who can walk into a panicked C-suite and say: “I can replace your inefficient 20-person department with myself, three sharp lieutenants, and a fleet of AI agents – and save you 40%.”

Wield AI as a weapon for your own advancement.

The Labor Market Is Approaching a Breaking Point

Exponential curves look flat for a long time … and then, suddenly, they go vertical.

We are right at the knee of that curve. The window to prepare is closing faster than most think.

It’s best to stop agonizing about whether we are in a 2000s-style stock bubble. A stock market crash hurts your portfolio temporarily. A structural shift in the value of human labor hurts your family permanently.

As automation accelerates and data centers explode in size, the U.S. is quietly executing what many insiders are calling a modern “Manhattan Project for AI.”

And Washington isn’t just funding this initiative. It’s partnering directly with select American companies it views as essential to winning the AI race — and those stocks are erupting.

This year alone, several smaller U.S. firms surged 200%… 300%… even 400% in a matter of days after government investment or contract news broke.

These aren’t hype-driven rallies. They’re the early winners of America’s AI buildout — the companies being positioned at the center of a multiyear national transformation.

And while millions of workers brace for AI-driven disruption, investors who understand where Washington is placing its strategic bets could be on the receiving end of one of the last great wealth transfers of our lifetime.

That’s why I’ve been working on something urgent, which you can now see for yourself.

I’ve identified a handful of overlooked American companies that I believe are next in line for government backing — and each has the potential to soar 10X as this new AI buildout accelerates.

I reveal the first one — 100% free — in my new briefing.

Developed by Shockwave Medical, part of Johnson & Johnson Medtech, Shockwave IVL was adapted from extracorporeal lithotripsy, a treatment that uses sound waves to break down kidney stones. The goal was to use similar acoustic wave technology to modify calcium in diseased arteries without damaging surrounding tissues.

IVL is used to treat cardiovascular diseases complicated by the buildup of calcium on the artery walls, called calcification. Calcification both restricts blood flow and limits the effectiveness of conventional treatments for PAD, including balloon dilatation (angioplasty) and stenting.

PAD is a condition where cholesterol-rich deposits accumulate in the arteries, forming narrowings. Such deposits may become calcified, restricting blood and oxygen flow to the limbs, over time leading to severe leg pain, limited mobility, and tissue damage and sometimes necessitating amputation. PAD primarily affects older adults and people with diabetes or kidney disease, but it is also tied to other risk factors including smoking and a genetic history of PAD.

IVL cracks calcium through the generation of shock waves, a form of ultrasonic acoustic pressure wave, with a lower pressure peak than extracorporeal lithotripsy. IVL is delivered by emitters placed within a balloon angioplasty catheter and can be used alone or in conjunction with other treatments such as atherectomy, angioplasty or stenting.

""The balloon is inflated at low pressure to avoid vessel damage, and an electrical current is passed to the emitter, creating an acoustic pressure wave,"" says Dr Nick West, chief medical officer at Shockwave Medical. ""That pressure wave is what cracks the calcium. What you're left with is a blood vessel that becomes more compliant – less stiff, if you like – so that you can expand it with conventional tools.""

IVL is enhancing how physicians and surgeons treat patients with calcified lesions, including the most severe form of peripheral artery disease – chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI is a progressive condition and represents the end stage of PAD, where in some cases extremely calcified arteries severely restrict blood and oxygen flow to the legs, leading to pain, ulcers and gangrene. Without timely treatment, patients may face amputation. However, IVL is a treatment option that could be used to attempt to avoid that outcome.

Treating calcified arteries in CLTI patients can be challenging, as the patient's arteries are more fragile, rigid and at higher risk of complication than in less severe cases of PAD, Dr Mark Portou, a consultant vascular surgeon in London, explains. For eligible patients whose doctors have recommended this treatment, the benefits can be significant.

Despite the known risk factors and prevalence of PAD, public knowledge surrounding the condition is limited. Over 200 million people are living with PAD worldwide, Dr Portou says, yet few know what it is. It remains a condition which is underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Belinda Bridgen suffered for five years before being diagnosed with PAD at the age of 70. Leading up to her diagnosis, she endured constant pain in her hip and leg. She visited doctors with these symptoms, but none ever mentioned the possibility of it being PAD.

Bridgen assumed her symptoms were a result of ageing. She subsequently visited a surgeon, who proposed back surgery. She underwent the procedure in 2022, hoping it would ease her discomfort – however it did not. As a result of the back surgery being ineffective, Bridgen thought that she would have to live with the debilitating pain that made even her short walk to the bus stop difficult.

In early 2025, doctors found a blockage in Bridgen's right iliac artery. With a history of kidney failure, including a kidney transplant, Bridgen returned to the doctors with resurfacing kidney failure symptoms. Through pre-kidney transplant assessments, doctors discovered a blockage and finally diagnosed Bridgen with PAD, upon which they offered IVL treatment.

Individual patient results may vary, but in Bridgen's experience, after a few weeks of tender bruising at the site of insertion of the IVL catheter, Bridgen was soon walking more comfortably. Her destinations now stretch much further than the post box – she can now walk to the pub to meet up with friends too. ""I've got my life back,"" she says, as she talks about her upcoming trip to Croatia and the prospect of finally joining guided walking tours that she used to sit out.

Bridgen stresses the importance of visiting a doctor as early as possible. Many patients delay getting assessed because they are afraid their symptoms may signal the need for a severe medical procedure.

Both Dr Portou and Dr West believe that the main barrier affecting patient outcomes is the misdiagnosis of PAD symptoms. Even among healthcare professionals, symptoms are often written off as signs of ageing, poor mobility, simple musculoskeletal issues or diabetes, they explain.

This lack of understanding can lead to delayed treatment and severe consequences. For example, approximately 20% of patients suffering with CLTI might require limb amputation within a year of diagnosis.

""The mortality for [CLTI] is worse than many cancers, which people don't realise. That needs to change,"" says Dr West. ""The symptoms can seem mild at first and patients often don't report them. That delay in diagnosis is one of the biggest obstacles to improving outcomes.""

As the global population ages and rates of diabetes continue to climb, technologies like IVL could play a vital role in preserving limbs and lives, especially when paired with patient and physician education. While IVL offers a step forward in treatment, it is still only serving as part of a wider scope of surgical and non-surgical options, not a cure. It requires experience and good clinical judgment and individual patient results may vary. ""This isn't a silver bullet. It's one part of a broader treatment paradigm that includes early diagnosis, appropriate screening and lifestyle management,"" says Dr West.

Patients should seek appropriate treatment for PAD, which may include IVL, to reduce the risk of serious complications, including a life-altering limb amputation. ""IVL is not a miracle and sometimes might not be enough,"" says Dr Portou. ""But it gives us a chance. When we save a limb, we're not just saving a foot, we're helping to save independence, mobility and a person's confidence to keep living.""",https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1920x1080/p0mhlm9s.jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 16:59:01.060791

While everyone chases the loudest AI ticker, this low-key industrial beast has been stacking real-world power plays and serious stock performance. So… is Parker-Hannifin actually worth your money, or just another background player you can ignore?

Real talk: if you care about steady growth, dividends, and companies that build the hardware behind literally everything that moves, you need to at least know this name.

The Hype is Real: Parker-Hannifin on TikTok and Beyond

Parker-Hannifin is not a meme stock. It’s not trending every second. But that’s exactly why long-term investors are paying attention. Instead of going viral for chaos, it’s quietly winning for execution.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch honest tests on YouTube

On social, the vibe is simple: this is a “grown-up” stock. Think engineers, builders, and finance creators who are over chasing the latest rug-pull and want something that actually throws off cash.

The Business Side: Parker-Hannifin Aktie

Let’s zoom in on the numbers, because that’s where Parker-Hannifin (ISIN: US7010941019) really starts to flex.

Stock data check-in:

According to multiple live feeds from major financial platforms (such as Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Parker-Hannifin trades on the NYSE under the ticker PH.

As of the latest available market data from these sources, the quote being shown reflects the most recent trading session’s last close, not a live intraday move.

I am not able to access a fully up-to-the-minute live price feed right now, so I will not guess a number. All current pricing, performance charts, and intraday moves should be pulled directly from a live source like:

Yahoo Finance – PH quote

MarketWatch – PH overview

Always double-check the latest price, percent change, and market cap there before you trade.

Here’s why the stock has serious “no-drama, all-business” energy:

Industrial backbone: Parker-Hannifin builds motion and control systems – hydraulics, pneumatics, filtration, aerospace tech. Basically, if it moves, lifts, flies, or operates in a tough environment, there’s a decent chance Parker has a part in it.

Revenue from the real economy: This isn’t pure hype. The company sells into manufacturing, energy, aerospace, transportation, and more. When big infrastructure and industrial projects go up, Parker gets paid.

Dividends + long-term compounding: It’s widely known as a solid dividend payer with a long history of returning cash to shareholders while still investing in growth.

On the clout scale, this is not a “look at my 10x YOLO” stock. It’s more of a “my portfolio aged up, and now it actually makes sense” type of move.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s break Parker-Hannifin down into three big angles: growth, stability, and hype potential.

1. Growth: Quiet but serious

Parker-Hannifin has been using acquisitions and tech upgrades to scale up. It’s pushing deeper into high-margin areas like aerospace and advanced motion control, where customers care about reliability way more than shaving a few bucks off.

This means it’s not just a “metal and pipes” company. It’s moving into smarter, more engineered systems that lock in long-term customers.

2. Stability: Big boomer energy (in a good way)

If you’re tired of watching your feed melt down every time a meme stock pops or drops, Parker-Hannifin is the opposite vibe. It’s been around for a long time, it serves massive industries, and it tends to track with the broader economy more than whatever is trending this week.

That doesn’t mean it can’t drop. Industrial stocks can get hit when growth fears spike. But compared to some flashy tech names, this one has actual assets, real contracts, and physical products people can’t just “unsubscribe” from overnight.

3. Hype potential: Under-the-radar flex

Parker-Hannifin is never going to trend like a meme token. But it has its own kind of clout: institutional respect. Long-only funds, pension money, and serious dividend investors pay attention to names like this.

So no, you’re probably not getting a viral spike out of nowhere. But over time? The stock has a track record that makes analysts treat it like a legit compounder, not a lottery ticket.

Parker-Hannifin vs. The Competition

Every industrial giant has rivals. For Parker-Hannifin, think big diversified players in motion, control, and industrial tech. One of the closest headline rivals is Eaton (ticker: ETN), another major name in power management and industrial systems.

Parker-Hannifin vs Eaton: Who wins the clout war?

Brand vibe: Eaton has slightly more mainstream recognition in some energy and electrical circles, but neither name is exactly a TikTok darling. Parker wins with deeper engineering cred across hydraulics and motion systems.

Diversification: Both are diversified, but Parker-Hannifin’s reach into aerospace and motion control gives it exposure to defense and aviation – sectors that can be very profitable in the right cycle.

Investor perception: Eaton often gets framed as a “power and electrical” play; Parker is seen more as a high-spec industrial and aerospace systems specialist. If you want more pure electrical infrastructure, Eaton has the edge. If you want motion, hydraulics, and aerospace strength, Parker stands out.

Who takes the win? From a social and narrative standpoint, neither is a hype machine. But if you want the under-the-radar pick with serious engineering depth and exposure to high-tech industrial applications, Parker-Hannifin quietly edges ahead.

Is It Worth the Hype?

This isn’t a stock you brag about in the group chat for instant clout. It’s the stock you brag about in five or ten years when everyone else is wondering how your “boring” picks pulled ahead.

Where Parker-Hannifin shines:

Real talk: It’s tied to physical infrastructure, manufacturing, aerospace, and energy – stuff that doesn’t vanish overnight.

Price performance: Historically, it’s been a strong compounder with periods of serious outperformance, especially when industrial and infrastructure spending is hot.

Risk level: Lower drama than hyped growth names, but still cyclical. When the economy slows, orders can cool off and the stock can wobble.

If you’re hunting for a “must-have” meme rocket, this is probably a drop. If you’re trying to build a portfolio that could still make sense years from now, Parker-Hannifin is very much in cop territory for further research.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Here’s the blunt breakdown.

Game-changer? In your portfolio strategy, yes. This is the kind of industrial name that can anchor a more mature, diversified setup. In terms of internet culture? Not really – it’s not a viral celebrity stock.

Price drop bait? When markets panic on growth fears or industrial slowdowns, stocks like Parker-Hannifin can pull back. For long-term investors, those dips can turn into “must-cop” entries if you actually believe in the business.

Is it worth the hype? For serious, patient investors: absolutely worth a closer look. For short-term clout-chasing: probably not your move.

Your move: If you’re building a grown-up portfolio, put Parker-Hannifin on your watchlist, dig into the latest earnings reports and guidance on its investor site at parker.com, and cross-check the latest price and valuation metrics on a live platform before you tap buy.

GE’s fridge meets this by blending hardware with software, much like how smartphones evolved from calls to life hubs.","In the bustling world of home appliances, where innovation often promises to simplify daily chores, General Electric has unveiled a refrigerator that could redefine how households manage their groceries. Announced just ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in 2026, the GE Profile Smart 4-Door French-Door Refrigerator integrates a built-in barcode scanner, a camera system, and seamless connectivity with Instacart, aiming to automate the tedious task of inventory tracking and shopping list creation. This isn’t just another smart fridge with a touchscreen; it’s a device that actively scans items as they’re placed inside, recognizes when supplies are low, and populates a digital shopping cart without user intervention.

The core feature revolves around the patented barcode scanner, embedded in the fridge’s interior. Users simply wave an item’s barcode in front of the scanner upon restocking, and the system logs it into an inventory database. As items are depleted—detected via internal cameras that monitor shelves—the fridge automatically adds them to a grocery list accessible through a companion app or an integrated 8-inch tablet on the door. This integration with Instacart allows for one-tap ordering, potentially turning the refrigerator into a proactive household manager. According to details from Engadget, the technology draws on AI to predict needs based on usage patterns, such as suggesting milk refills if the scanner notes frequent scans of cereal boxes.

Industry observers note that this launch comes at a time when consumers are increasingly seeking ways to reduce mental load in the kitchen. GE’s press release highlights how the Kitchen Assistant feature—essentially the fridge’s AI brain—can even scan perishables for freshness, alerting users to impending expirations via notifications. Priced at around $3,500, the 27.9 cubic foot model positions itself as a premium offering, blending French-door aesthetics with cutting-edge tech that could appeal to busy families and tech-savvy professionals alike.

Unpacking the Technology Behind the Scan

Delving deeper into the mechanics, the barcode scanner isn’t a mere gimmick; it’s powered by advanced optical recognition software that interfaces with a vast database of product UPC codes. This allows the fridge to identify not just the item but also its typical shelf life and nutritional data, which can feed into meal planning suggestions. The internal cameras, meanwhile, use computer vision algorithms to estimate quantities—say, how many eggs are left in a carton—without requiring manual input. GE claims this reduces food waste by up to 20%, a statistic echoed in early reviews from tech sites.

Integration with Instacart is particularly noteworthy, as it leverages the delivery service’s API for real-time pricing and availability checks. Users can customize preferences, like opting for organic alternatives or specific brands, and the system learns from past orders to refine suggestions. As reported by The Verge, this fridge builds on previous smart kitchen experiments but introduces a level of automation that feels genuinely hands-off, distinguishing it from competitors like Samsung’s Family Hub, which relies more on manual list-building.

For industry insiders, the real intrigue lies in the data ecosystem. GE’s appliance connects to the company’s broader smart home platform, potentially sharing insights with other devices like ovens or pantries. This could enable scenarios where the fridge communicates with a smart oven to suggest recipes based on available ingredients, further embedding AI into everyday cooking routines.

Market Positioning and Competitive Edges

Positioned against a backdrop of evolving consumer behaviors, GE’s fridge taps into the growing demand for connected kitchens. Recent posts on X highlight user excitement, with many praising the potential for seamless grocery automation amid rising food costs and time constraints. One viral thread discussed how such tech could alleviate the “mental load” of meal planning, drawing parallels to earlier innovations like Amazon’s Dash buttons.

Comparisons to rivals are inevitable. LG and Samsung have long dominated the smart fridge segment with features like door-in-door access and integrated screens, but GE’s barcode focus addresses a specific pain point: forgetting what’s inside. Mashable notes in its CES coverage that while Samsung’s models offer recipe apps and family calendars, they lack this inventory-scanning precision, which could give GE an edge in efficiency-driven markets.

From a business perspective, this launch aligns with GE Appliances’ strategy under Haier ownership to innovate in the premium segment. Sales data from recent years show smart appliances growing at a 15% annual rate, per industry reports, and GE aims to capture a slice by emphasizing practicality over flashy gimmicks. Insiders speculate that partnerships like Instacart could expand to other services, such as Amazon Fresh or local grocers, broadening appeal.

Challenges in Adoption and Privacy Concerns

Yet, no innovation is without hurdles. Early adopters might face compatibility issues, as the scanner relies on standard barcodes; unpackaged produce or bulk items could require manual entry via the app. Moreover, the always-on cameras raise privacy questions—GE assures users that footage is processed locally and not stored in the cloud, but skeptics point to past data breaches in smart home devices.

Cost remains a barrier; at $3,500, it’s a significant investment compared to basic models under $1,000. Tom’s Guide highlights in its review that while the tech justifies the price for high-income households, broader adoption might hinge on scaled-down versions or subsidies through energy-efficient incentives.

On the regulatory front, as smart devices proliferate, there’s increasing scrutiny over energy consumption and e-waste. GE’s model boasts Energy Star certification, but insiders worry about the environmental impact of embedded electronics that could shorten appliance lifespans.

Broader Implications for Kitchen Innovation

Looking ahead, this fridge exemplifies a shift toward predictive appliances that anticipate needs rather than merely respond. Drawing from X discussions, enthusiasts envision ecosystems where fridges integrate with robotic kitchens, like the CA-1 system in Germany that automates cooking, potentially creating fully autonomous home food management.

GE’s approach could influence supply chains, too. By aggregating user data (anonymized, per the company), manufacturers might gain insights into consumption trends, aiding inventory for retailers. GE Appliances’ press room emphasizes how this reduces the “grocery guesswork,” a sentiment echoed in business analyses predicting a $50 billion market for smart kitchen tech by 2030.

For developers and engineers, the open APIs hinted at in the launch could spur third-party apps, from dietary trackers to sustainability monitors, fostering an innovation ecosystem around the device.

Evolving Consumer Expectations and Future Horizons

Consumers today expect appliances to do more than preserve food—they want them to enhance lifestyles. GE’s fridge meets this by blending hardware with software, much like how smartphones evolved from calls to life hubs. Posts on X from tech influencers underscore this, with some comparing it to Amazon Go’s cashierless stores, where sensors automate transactions seamlessly.

Potential expansions include voice control via integrations with Alexa or Google Assistant, allowing verbal queries about inventory while cooking. BusinessWire details how the Kitchen Assistant evolves with over-the-air updates, ensuring the fridge improves post-purchase.

Ultimately, success will depend on user feedback. Pilot programs in select markets could refine features, addressing any glitches in barcode recognition or app usability.

Industry Ripple Effects and Strategic Insights

The ripple effects extend to competitors, who may accelerate their own scanner integrations. Samsung, for instance, has experimented with AI cameras, but GE’s patent could provide a temporary moat. Analysts predict this could boost GE’s market share in North America, where smart home adoption lags behind Asia.

From an investment standpoint, Haier’s backing positions GE to leverage global manufacturing for cost efficiencies. CNET explores how this tech might “change grocery shopping forever,” by making lists dynamic and context-aware.

In supply chain terms, automated reordering could stabilize demand for staples, benefiting producers and reducing waste across the board.

Pushing Boundaries in Home Automation

As kitchens become smarter, ethical considerations emerge. Who owns the data from your fridge? GE pledges transparency, but industry watchers call for stronger standards. X threads debate this, with some users excited about personalized nutrition advice, others wary of surveillance.

Future iterations might include scent sensors for spoilage detection or AR overlays via the tablet for virtual meal prep. Yahoo Finance reports on the launch’s stock impact, noting a bump in investor confidence.

For insiders, this fridge signals a maturation of IoT in homes, where devices don’t just connect—they collaborate to streamline life.

Refining the Vision for Tomorrow’s Kitchens

Refinement will come from real-world use. Beta testers report high accuracy in scanning, but edge cases like faded barcodes pose challenges. GE’s roadmap includes machine learning updates to handle such variances.

Broader adoption could influence urban planning, with smart fridges in apartments reducing trips to stores and easing traffic. Posts on X from urban dwellers highlight this appeal in dense cities.

In essence, GE’s innovation bridges the gap between convenience and intelligence, setting a new benchmark for what a refrigerator can achieve in the modern home.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-5438-1767550816.jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 14:13:14.936079

data shows more than 12,000 news stories mentioned “AI bubble” in November alone — roughly matching the total from the prior ten months combined.","As enthusiasm around artificial intelligence continues to propel stock markets to record levels, a growing number of investors are asking a familiar question: are we watching another financial bubble form one that could eventually burst?

‍

History suggests the answer isn’t black and white.

‍

The S&P 500 climbed 16% in 2025, driven largely by AI heavyweights such as Nvidia, Alphabet, Broadcom, and Microsoft. At the same time, unease has been building over the massive sums Big Tech is pouring into AI infrastructure. Capital spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta is projected to jump 34% to about $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data.

‍

Beyond public markets, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure a staggering figure for a privately held company that has yet to turn a profit. Adding to investor concern is the circular nature of many of these arrangements, where funding and spending cycle between OpenAI and a small group of publicly traded tech giants.

‍

According to Brian Levitt, chief global market strategist at Invesco, periods of technological transformation have often been accompanied by excessive investment. He points to past revolutions such as railroads, electricity, and the internet as examples where capital poured in aggressively before demand fully materialized.

‍

“At some point, infrastructure spending can overshoot what the economy needs in the short term,” Levitt said. “But that doesn’t mean the railroads weren’t completed or that the internet didn’t ultimately reshape the world.”

‍

Still, with equity valuations inching higher and the S&P 500 logging its third consecutive year of double-digit gains, investor anxiety is understandable. Many are questioning how much upside remains and how severe the downside could be if AI fails to deliver on its promise. That risk is magnified by the fact that Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, and Meta now make up nearly 30% of the S&P 500, meaning any sharp selloff in AI stocks would ripple through the broader market.

‍

“A bubble usually bursts in a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who does not believe AI stocks are currently in a bubble. “And we don’t see a bear market on the horizon.”

‍

So how does today’s AI boom compare with past market bubbles?

‍

One way to assess whether the AI-fueled rally has moved too far, too fast is to compare it with historical bull markets. Research from Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, examining 10 equity bubbles worldwide since 1900, found they lasted just over two and a half years on average and delivered gains of about 244% from trough to peak.

‍

By contrast, the current AI-driven advance is entering its third year. Since the end of 2022, the S&P 500 has risen 79%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 has surged 130%.

‍

While the data doesn’t point to a definitive conclusion, Hartnett cautions against abandoning equities solely out of bubble fears. Historically, the final phase of a rally tends to be the strongest, and missing it can be costly. As a hedge, he suggests selectively adding cheaper value exposures, such as UK stocks or energy companies.

‍

Market Concentration

The S&P 500’s 10 largest companies now account for roughly 40% of the index a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has unsettled some investors, including veteran strategist Ed Yardeni, who said in December that he no longer recommends overweighting technology stocks.

‍

Market historians note, however, that today’s concentration is not without precedent. Paul Marsh, a professor at London Business School who has studied 125 years of global market returns, points out that leading stocks held similar weightings in the 1930s and 1960s. In 1900, railroads made up 63% of U.S. market value, compared with about 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024.

‍

Fundamentals

Identifying bubbles in real time is notoriously difficult, largely because debates hinge on fundamentals and those metrics evolve, said Dario Perkins, an economist at TS Lombard.

‍

“It’s easy to argue that ‘this time is different’ and that traditional valuation measures no longer apply,” he said.

‍

Even so, some fundamentals still matter. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders generally carry lower debt relative to earnings than companies such as WorldCom did in the late 1990s. Moreover, firms like Nvidia and Meta are already reporting meaningful profit growth tied to AI, something that was largely absent during the speculative boom 25 years ago.

‍

That said, rising credit risk is making some investors uneasy. After Oracle sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, its stock fell 5.6% the following day and is down 37% since. Looking ahead, Meta, Alphabet, and Oracle are expected to raise a combined $86 billion in 2026, according to estimates from Société Générale.

‍

Valuations

By some measures, the S&P 500 is trading at its highest valuation ever outside of the early 2000s. Its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio — developed by economist Robert Shiller and based on inflation-adjusted earnings over a decade — sits near historic extremes.

‍

Optimists counter that while valuations are rising, the pace is far more measured than during the dot-com bubble. In 2000, Cisco traded at more than 200 times trailing earnings. Nvidia, by comparison, trades at under 50 times earnings today.

‍

According to Janus Henderson fund manager Richard Clode, bubbles typically form when stock prices detach entirely from earnings growth. “We’re not at that point yet,” he said.

‍

Investor Scrutiny

Talk of an AI bubble simmered throughout the year but intensified in November and December following warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. data shows more than 12,000 news stories mentioned “AI bubble” in November alone — roughly matching the total from the prior ten months combined.

‍

A December Bank of America survey found investors view an AI bubble as the market’s biggest “tail risk,” with more than half citing the Magnificent Seven as Wall Street’s most crowded trade.

‍

That environment contrasts with the dot-com era, when enthusiasm for the internet went largely unquestioned, said Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy at Barclays. Today, scrutiny is growing, particularly as companies ramp up borrowing to fund AI investments.

‍

“I wouldn’t dismiss the risks,” Krishna said. “But healthy skepticism is a good thing. That scrutiny may be exactly what prevents the kind of extreme excesses that lead to a crash.”

If your pet is heavy, they are more likely to have more health challenges and a shorter life.

— Cat and Dog Lover

DEAR CAT AND DOG LOVER: That’s a timely question as the holiday season which began more than six weeks ago finally comes to a close after Jan. 6, the Feast of the Epiphany.

Feasting is the theme in the winter months, and given that many pets, particularly dogs do not get as much exercise when it’s cold out, monitoring your pet’s weight is key.

The rule of thumb for dogs and cats is that they should consume no more than 25 to 30 calories per pound per day. So a cat who weighs 10 pounds should be consuming no more than 300 calories a day.

Veterinarians recommend that treats compose no more than 10 percent of the total number of calories, so a 10-pound cat should have 270 calories of food, and no more than 30 calories a day in treats.

Many cat treats are 1 or 2 calories each and these should be given sparingly — never by the handful.

If your dog is 50 pounds, that’s around 1,400 calories per day with no more than 140 calories composed of treats.

Our dog gets a Pedigree Dentastix at the end of her day, which is 65 to 75 calories per stick. Just one however!

Vets in North America report obesity is one of the leading issues with pets they treat. And obesity can lead to a number of health problems including: osteo-arthritis and joint inflamation, cardiovascular and endocrine malfunction and metabolic abnormalities.

If your pet is heavy, they are more likely to have more health challenges and a shorter life.

Smaller dogs are more likely to be obese, with pugs topping the list.

So, how can you help your pet lose weight?

First, be a responsible pet owner from the day you adopt your pet. Know how much your pet weighs and read labels on food so you are not giving your pet more calories than they need.

Finally, do not substitute food and treats for attention and exercise. They’re not asking for a treat. They’re asking for you to pay attention to them.

Give them vigorous petting and show some love.

We asked our Be PAWSitive community how they handled weight gain in pets. Mary Flibbert of Worcester helped her 18-pound cat reduce to 14 pounds by eliminating treats and dry food.

“All I did was feed him all the canned food that he wanted,” she reports.

TheraPAWS Pet Team member Cap Corduan has Keifer, a Bernese mountain dog, which can be a very large dog.

Last December, Keifer weighed 130 pounds, and Cap knew she “had to get the weight off him for his health as well as to get the weight off his joints.”

By putting Keifer on weight management food and providing veggies as a snack he’s “now at the right weight of 115 pounds.

This ruling is critical for Novo Nordisk as it fortifies the company's defensive ""moat"" against generic competition.","Following a punishing 2025 that saw its market capitalization nearly halve, pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk is showing early signs of a potential recovery as 6 begins. Two critical developments—a favorable court ruling in China and the U.S. launch of a next-generation product—are providing the foundation for what investors hope will be a sustained turnaround.

The company is taking strategic offensive action with the commercial rollout in the United States. After securing FDA approval late last year, Novo Nordisk has now begun selling an oral tablet version of its Wegovy treatment. This new format presents a significant competitive edge by eliminating the need for daily injections. Clinical trial data indicates it facilitates an average weight loss of 16.6 percent.

This launch grants the Danish firm a lead time estimated at two to three months before competing products, such as Eli Lilly's anticipated Orforglipron, are expected to enter the market. Priced aggressively at $149 per month, the oral Wegovy is positioned to target the broader consumer market.

Valuation Presents a Contrast to Competitive Pressures

The dramatic share price contraction over the past twelve months, which erased approximately 48 percent of the stock's value, has resulted in a fundamentally cheaper valuation. The equity closed the recent week at €44.61.

* The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio now stands near 14.15, well below its historical average of around 22.50.

* This valuation also sits at a discount to the broader healthcare sector average of 18.4.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Novo Nordisk?

Despite this apparent value, the competitive landscape remains intensely challenging. Rival Eli Lilly has recently captured market share at a faster pace with its product Zepbound. While Novo Nordisk reported growth of 12 percent in the third quarter of 2025, Lilly's revenue from Zepbound surged by 185 percent over the same period.

Legal Victory Strengthens Long-Term Position

A major catalyst for the current stabilization originates from Asia. China's Supreme People's Court has upheld the patent validity for the active ingredient semaglutide. This ruling is critical for Novo Nordisk as it fortifies the company's defensive ""moat"" against generic competition. Semaglutide forms the basis for the blockbuster drugs Wegovy and Ozempic; a loss of patent protection would have opened the door widely for copycat versions. Market analysts view this decision as a pivotal step toward securing long-term revenue in the crucial Chinese market.

For a durable reversal of fortune to take hold, the new oral medications must now rapidly generate measurable sales. Investor attention in the coming weeks will be squarely fixed on the execution of the U.S. launch and the first-quarter sales figures. Although the clarified patent situation and depressed valuation provide a base, the ultimate success of the new tablet will determine whether the prolonged downtrend has truly been broken.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422333_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:59:56.716653

A Disney actor turned animator turned game developer has just shared one of her favourite pieces of technical advice for achieving fluid animation, and it's a point she says is often overlooked (you might also want to make sure you're familiar with the Pixar rules of storytelling).

Libby Peterson is a former Disney and Pixar animator who worked on movies such as Lilo & Stitch. Stylised keyframe animation is her specialty. She's now working at Lucasfilm’s Industrial Light & Magic while also developing a K-Pop souls-like indie game in her spare time.

In the video above, she uses a character from her game to demonstrate the importance of extremes in animation. She says many people make the mistake of only focusing on key storytelling poses and breakdown poses, not on extreme poses.

An extreme pose is the furthest point that any part of a character's body touches. In a jump, for example, it would be the highest point the body reaches.

Libby points out that extreme poses naturally incorporate two of the 12 Disney principles of animation: arcs for natural-looking movement, and offset and drag to convey the impression of weight and mass.

""Focusing on your extremes and making sure each axis in both translations and rotation hits its extreme on different frames is what makes animation fluid,"" Libby says ""Also make sure the extremes of different parts of the body hit on different frames as well. Essentially this is how I think and approach animating drag and follow through and create arcs.""

It's vital to focus on individual rotations and forward and left to right movement and making sure they don't hit on the same frame, Libby says, otherwise, you get triangular janky movement.

The focus on extremes applies both to a pose-to-pose or a layered workflow, although Libby says it was when she was animating layered that the importance of extremes really clicked because animating one muscle mass at a time forces you to think about extreme poses and energy.

She recommends studying video reference to see where extremes naturally occur and then exaggerate them as needed for the desired animation style.

That could soon change.

The first drug discovered and designed using AI, Insilico Medicine’s Rentosertib, is likely to enter a Phase 3 clinical trial in the next 18 months, the final stage before seeking FDA approval. And it will reach that milestone in record time.

In the meantime, the coming year is sure to see a stepped-up pace of AI investments, deals, and partnerships by Big Pharma, venture capital firms, and biotech startups. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is investing more than $100 million of his own money in AI-based drug startups.

As a result, Precedence Research estimates that the global drug industry’s investment in AI will reach $2.51 billion in 2026 and $16.49 billion by 2034.

Fading into the background is the skepticism often heard at the start of 2025 about AI’s ability to have a significant impact on drug R&D. “We are really seeing AI being used across the board now,” said Samuel Scarpino, director of AI + life sciences at Northeastern University and an advisor to many biotech startups. “I don’t think we can point to a clear winner yet… but it is definitely producing a lot of value,” he said.

Pharma giant Eli Lilly is one of the industry’s leaders in adopting AI. In October, the company announced a partnership with Nvidia to build a powerful supercomputer to run an ""AI factory,"" powered by more than 1,000 super-powerful chips, which will be used to discover and test millions of potential medicines.

Lilly also just signed a deal with Insilico Medicine, potentially worth $100 million, to use the startup’s AI platform to jointly identify and develop new therapies. Diogo Rau, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer of Lilly. says the company is encouraging every employee to incorporate AI into their work. ""I don't believe any other company in our industry is doing what we do at this scale,” he said.

Rau does acknowledge that “there is still a ton of hype out there,” but predicted that an AI-discovered drug could reach the market by 2030. “AI is doing very, very well at discovering new molecules” that can be turned into drugs, he says.

The end of the decade may seem like a lengthy timeline, except that it typically takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new drug, at a cost of $2 billion and up. Just getting to the point where a drug can be tested in humans can take a minimum of 4 to 5 years, and nine out of 10 drug candidates never make it that far.

That’s why there is so much interest in Insilico’s Rentosertib — it went into human trials in less than two years, a blistering pace for the industry.

Insilico, based in Boston and Hong Kong, was founded in 2014 by Alex Zhavoronkov to take advantage of an AI platform he co-developed to replace animal testing. Rentosertib is its first drug candidate, a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic and deadly lung disease with no known cure that kills about 40,000 people each year in the United States.

In June, the company announced that Rentosertib improved lung function with few side effects in a phase II study of 71 patients, clearing the way to start a larger phase III trial. Though the drug could still fail, “I don’t want to play down this accomplishment,” says Northeastern’s Scarpino. “The typical time frame for drug development has been dramatically shortened. This could be a game changer.”

Venture capital investors are betting on such an outcome. According to a November Pitchbook report, VCs invested a total of $2.7 billion in AI drug development firms through the first three quarters of 2025, even while overall investment in biotech startups slowed. The funding difference illustrates the “frenzied AI investment environment and investor conviction in the ability of AI integration to drive greater R&D efficiency,” PitchBook said in its report.

Although drug researchers have been using early forms of AI for decades, excitement over the technology’s ability to speed R&D came with the introduction in 2020 of AlphaFold2, an artificial intelligence system developed by Google DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs that made it possible to predict the three dimensional structure of some 200 million biological molecules. It’s creators were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2024, and the model has been used by more than 2 million people from 190 countries.

Lilly’s Rau cautions that AI is a long way from replacing researchers, although it will shift the roles humans will play. And it has a limited role to play in human trials. “We are still limited on how long it takes the biology to work.” he said. “The clinical trials will still take years and years.”

Nevertheless, a recent survey of people working in biopharma by Endpoints Signal, a division of the Financial Times, found that 48% of respondents describe themselves as heavy AI users. And though only 15% of those surveyed said AI is doing transformative work in research and development today, three-quarters expect AI to transform the drug discovery process by 2030; 12% think the change will come as soon as three years.

One of the biggest proponents of AI in drug R&D is Altman; the OpenAI CEO invested $180 million three years ago to seed Retro Bio, which is partnering with OpenAI to develop drugs that can ""reverse age-related diseases."" Keeping with Silicon Valley's longevity fixation, Retro’s ambitious goal is to add a decade to the lifespan of healthy humans.

It's been a year since Bristol Live announced that the 'biggest change to Bristol' is coming - the biggest since the aftermath of the Second World War - and most people don’t know too much about it. But is the transformation of Bristol under way already, and what has happened in the past year?

The change involves a huge swathe of the city, from St Pauls, across the M32 to St Jude’s, Lawrence Hill, St Phillips, Temple Meads and around to Bedminster, is on the cusp of being transformed so much, it will be unrecognisable to Bristolians in just five years’ time. That area forms an inner city arc of industry that's clearly visible from space, in between the city centre and the Victorian terraces of the residential city beyond.

And the transformation raises huge questions which are so far going largely unanswered about where people in a city like Bristol work, what kind of jobs they have, where they live and what kind of homes they have? The transformation has its origins in decisions taken ten or more years ago, and is already starting to get underway.

Most of Bristol already know that major change is coming to the city centre - with Broadmead, the Bearpit and the Galleries seeing a huge amount of development heading its way in the next few years. But this is even bigger than that, will affect more people, a larger area and have even more impact.

After the war, those in charge of rebuilding a bombed-out city took the opportunity for a complete change. The tightly-packed terraced streets that ringed the east and south east of the city centre were cleared away, the residents were generally sent to live in new communities of council estates on the outskirts of the city, and a new Bristol was born - a network of dual carriageways and huge roundabouts, industrial estates, warehouses and factories ringed the city centre.

This was city planning on a grand scale. The idea was that people would live in nicer, modern homes with gardens in places like Hillfields or Knowle, and commute in to work in the industry of Bristol’s inner core, in the factories of Bedminster’s Malago Road, the heavy industry of St Philips Marsh or Lawrence Hill and the industrial estates of St Jude’s.

It was a vision that has lasted about 60 years - until now. For now, the post-war inner city industrial estates are being, or about to be, swept away even more quickly than they were created. Every other week during 2024 and 2025 seemed to see a new major planning application trouble the city council’s planning department, or a new consultation launched by a large-scale developer. Where is this happening - the list is a long one. Let's start at the northern tip of this inner city industrial arc.

St Pauls

In St Pauls, an entire area of the city from St Nicholas Road to Portland Square was originally terraced homes, and schools. Victorian maps show long-lost terraced streets with forgotten names - Lake Street, Cabot Street, St Lawrence Street. They were cleared and factories built close to the M32 motorway. Now, that industrial area has gone too, and plans for hundreds of new homes to fill in the gaps have been proposed for a long time.

St Judes

On the other side of the River Frome and the great divide created by the M32, St Jude’s is about to change fast. St Judes has long been a warren of warehouses, factories and storage yards, ever since the post-war planners cleared the terraced slums and replaced them with low-rise industrial buildings.

But there’s now a plan agreed by the council for it to be transformed again, into something called the Frome Gateway. No sooner had the ink dried on the first draft than the developers were in, submitting planning applications for student flats and build-to-rent flats, a new bridge across the River Frome and the creation of a ‘vibrant’ new residential area.

That regeneration is now edging right up to the city centre itself - the owners of Cabot Circus unveiled plans for hundreds of student flats to be built between the shopping centre car park and the Newfoundland Way junction, earlier this year.

Lawrence Hill

Many of Lawrence Hill and Barton Hill’s terraced streets remained after the war, and those that were cleared were replaced by the vast 1960s council tower blocks that dominate the skyline here. Industry in the area was centred up and down the railway line, and dominated by the Bristol Wagon Works at the turn of the 20th century, which became the industrial estates that separate Lawrence Hill from Easton Road.

It’s early days for this, but there are proposals for thousands of new homes to be built on either side of the railway line to create a new part of Lawrence Hill.

St Phillips

Viewed from the air, St Philips is easily recognisable for the huge roofs of its warehouses and industrial units. It was always a tough place to live, with long lost Victorian terraced streets like Edward Street and Chapel Street bumping up against the rail yards, goods sheds and gas works. Between the railway and the Feeder, the people of the Dings have long been used to being surrounded by iron works and heavy industry.

But in the next ten years, St Philips is set to be radically transformed. It’s already happening the closer you get to Temple Meads station. If you want a vision of what this new long inner city arc of Bristol will be like in ten or 15 years’ time, take a stroll down Avon Street, where this transformation is nearing completion - a canyon of blocks of flats and student accommodation either side of a wide-pavemented road.

St Philips is part of the Temple Quarter regeneration scheme, a vast billion-pound project to replace the industrial landscape from Avonmeads to Temple Meads. Along the waterfront, and in pockets near Oxford Street it’s already happening, with student flats and a new university campus being created before the very eyes of the daily commuters into Temple Meads station.

And 2025 saw a major first step forward for this transformation - which is coming in the next ten years. The city council and the Temple Quarter bosses gave a first outline of what the area could look like, and consulted on different ways it will be shaped.

That feedback returned said one of Bristol's most iconic roads - Feeder Road, the long straight road on the south bank of the Feeder Canal - should one day be pedestrianised, as people rather than industry and car dealerships, live along it.

2025 saw some progress too on the north side of the Feeder. A couple of huge new student accommodation complexes neared completion, ready for the grand opening of Bristol University's new campus in September 2026. And work finally got underway to build the new Oasis Academy Temple Quarter secondary school.

East Bedminster

Across the river and further along the railway, there was once an area of Bedminster rich in history. Terraced streets called things like Weare Street, York Street, Nicholas Street and King Street were home for thousands of people, penned in by the railway line and the Totterdown and Victoria Park hill side to the south, the river to the north and surround by tanneries and the big Pylle Hill Goods Depot. It was out of these Victorian two-up-two-downs that Hillary Clinton’s great-grandfather grew up and eventually emigrated.

He started life on a terraced street that was cleared away by the Luftwaffe and the post-war slum clearers which, prophetically, was near Whitehouse Street. And this entire area was transformed in the 1960s into light industrial estates full of bodyshops, garages, automotive firms, printers and food manufacturers.

Now, it’s set to be transformed again. Two separate ‘development frameworks’ - one for the land to the east of St Luke’s Road and the other for the land to the west over to Bedminster Parade - have been developed, and the first plans for these sites are already being proposed. Nothing has started to be built yet, but it won’t be long.

Bedminster Green

At the southern end of Whitehouse Street is Whitehouse Lane, and another arm of industrial land that runs right into the heart of Bedminster, along the railway line. Either side of Malago Road, build-to-rent flats up to 16 storeys tall, and vast student accommodation complexes housing 819 students have already been built, and work on the second major student accommodation complex has now started. Even further south into Bedminster, empty builders' yards, car dealerships and now an empty printworks have or are proposed to be transformed into more flats or student accommodation.

Is the transformation stalling already?

Many aspects of this transformation of Bristol's 'inner-city industrial arc' are going ahead right on schedule and as planned. Where there is an economic driver in place, things are progressing rapidly. The opening of Bristol University's new Temple Quarter campus is prompting many Purpose Built Student Accommodation developments, both in the immediate area around St Philips and Temple Quarter, but also in the city centre and in Bedminster.

But 2025 saw something of a hiccup for the first time since the Covid pandemic, to the relentless march of Build-to-Rent flats and blocks of shared housing - prompted by a number of challenges facing the building industry.

The first is that new fire safety regulations state that any new residential building over 18m tall has to have two staircases - a legacy of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. That has seen developers go back to the drawing board with their plans for developments with more than seven or eight storeys - which almost all of them are.

And that has, the developers say, hit viability. If you have to include another staircase, that's less space for flats. Staircases don't pay rent but the lost 20 flats would. Then, there's the other regulations brought in as part of the Grenfell Tragedy changes. Many Bristol developments have become mired in bureaucracy and, with the costs of building spiralling, affordability issues.

Bristol's inner-city arc is full of developments that have been given planning permission, but have not seen any work - yet. One of the most high profile is the former Robins & Day Peugeot dealership, on the corner of the Bath Road Bridge roundabout opposite Temple Meads station. Across the river, something remarkable happened in 2025 to further highlight the stalling progress of the Bristol building boom.

A huge industrial estate, which Bristol City Council had drawn up plans to allow 900 flats to be built on, right in front of the famous Totterdown hillside, went up for sale. But developers wanting to get stuck into building those 900 flats to create the new 'Mead Street Framework' plan for flats within walking distance of Temple Meads and the new university, found themselves out-bid at auction by a landowner whose business is owning industrial estates.

Facing increased costs of building 900 flats, the residential developers couldn't commit to spending as much up front as the firm that wanted to keep it - for now, at least - as an industrial estate, with guaranteed rents and leases from the businesses already there. The Mead Street Regeneration part of the inner-city arc is currently on hold.

What kind of new homes are being created?

The Victorian expansion of Bristol that created the inner city from St Pauls to Bedminster ended up being the slums of the early 20th century. These were overcrowded shared terraced housing with outside loos, no bathrooms and often large families on just one floor or, worse, in one room. They were pulled down from the 1930s, bombed in the 1940s and cleared completely in the 1950s, to be replaced by the light industrial estates of the 1960s and 70s of factories and warehouses.

The new vision of housing back in the 1930s was places like Knowle, Sea Mills and Southmead - large, well-built homes with big gardens, bathrooms and central heating, followed by the likes of Hartcliffe, Lockleaze, Hillfields, Withywood, Broomhill and Lawrence Weston in the 1950s and 60s.

The third wave of Bristol’s housing boom will be neither of these, and it will be very different again. Instead of houses the boom of the 2020s and 2030s will be almost entirely flats - in blocks of between six and ten storeys and towers of up to 16, 17, maybe even 20 or 22 storeys high.

Instead of homes to buy with a mortgage, they will be almost entirely ‘build to rent’, providing an all-in-one package where everything from internet connection to water supply is covered by the rent.

The ‘build-to-rent’ phenomenon sees the developers building the blocks of flats also then continue to own them, collecting rent and dealing with maintenance of the shared areas. In the Bristol of the future, tens of thousands of people will live in ‘serviced apartment buildings’, where the level of service depends on the level of rent.

As well as ‘build-to-rent’, the new explosion of building also includes purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA) and ‘Co-living’, although so far that’s a mode of housing that has so far been confined to developments in the city centre. Co-living is basically the same as ‘Build-to-Rent ’, but in shared flats that feel more like student accommodation.

The young Bristol resident of the second half of the 2020s and into the 2030s and beyond, will see the dream of buying their own home in the city go further and further away.

The PBSA and BtR combination leaves little scope for what is classed in planning terms as ‘affordable housing’. This could be anything from shared ownership to homes sold at a discount to teachers, nurses, paramedics or police officers, but in almost all cases it has been and will continue to be homes at a discounted rent.

That discount could be around 80 per cent of the rent charged on the open market, so-called ‘affordable rent’, or it could be ‘social rent’, which is normally much lower. In both cases, rented ‘affordable homes’ are taken on by a housing association and let to people on Bristol’s HomeChoice waiting list and bidding system.

How many of the new homes of Bristol’s third wave will be classed as ‘affordable’ has been a contentious issue. One of the first things Marvin Rees did as Mayor of Bristol - alongside scrapping rules which limited the height of buildings that could be built in the city - was to water down the requirements for developers to include affordable housing in their projects.

It was - and still, in theory at least, is - 40 per cent affordable homes in the city centre and 30 per cent outside the city centre. The developers told the Mayor and council chiefs that was a block to building more - the developers weren’t making enough profit to able to write off 30 or 40 per cent of their homes at a discount to a housing association.

A new bit of planning guidance in 2017 dropped that to 20 per cent, if the developers met certain criteria, and the developers have found this more favourable. At the time, the then Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said Bristol couldn't let 'the perfect be the enemy of the good', arguing that 20 per cent of something was better than 30 or 40 per cent of nothing. Now, pretty much most projects to redevelop Bristol’s industrial arc have 20 per cent affordable as standard - apart from student accommodation, where it’s not required at all.

So the new homes of the third Bristol boom will be flats in tower blocks, not houses in gardens; rented from a private development company, not bought with a mortgage and, in most cases, at the top end of rented accommodation in the city.

What will the impact be?

The most immediate and obvious impact is that tens of thousands of new homes will be created. What, if any, effect building thousands of new homes, albeit one and two-bed flats and student accommodation, will have on Bristol’s much lamented housing crisis has been and will increasingly be the subject of strong debate.

Those advocating for the shackles to come off the planning process and the widespread building of new homes - the self-styled YIMBYs - say building thousands of new homes will see rents and house prices fall for everyone else too. They also point to the building of densely-packed new homes on brownfield sites in cities as something which could take the pressure off the edge of town greenfield sites that environmentalists and those labelled NIMBYs are desperate to protect.

There are doubts however. Rents have continued to spiral upwards in Bristol despite the much-celebrated 12,534 new homes built in the period Marvin Rees was in office as Mayor. The price of buying a home, which spiralled in the 2010s, might have stopped spiralling, but is still out of reach of most young people, who struggle to find the rent each month let alone save for a deposit.

READ MORE: The 'co-living' boom about to hit Bristol - solution or problem?READ MORE: How affordable are the 'record levels of affordable housing' being built in Bristol

As stated, these will be almost entirely privately rented, or ‘Co-Living’ or student accommodation, so the idea that the third great transformation of Bristol will help the other aspect of the housing crisis - the people on the council’s housing waiting list - appears doubtful too.

With just 20 per cent of the build to rent homes - not including the student accommodation - classed as ‘affordable’, that is 2,000 new ‘council homes’ for every 10,000 new homes built in Bristol’s industrial ‘inner arc’. The city would have to built 100,000 to find a home for everyone currently on the waiting list - and that’s not including the people who need new council flats in the coming years as the first generation of 1950s and 60s tower blocks are almost certainly and eventually condemned.

The effects on jobs

The first industrial sites to be earmarked for the great transformation have tended to be empty factories and industrial units, but increasingly, the developers are coming for places where there are perfectly healthy businesses and jobs. These are businesses often on - at most - five year leases, but many have one or two year leases or break clauses. Companies do get notice, and often have contingency plans.

In Fishponds, the huge Graphic Packaging International site is set to be transformed into as many as 2,500 new homes after the firm itself decided to up sticks and move to a new site in Yate. On the banks of the river in Bedminster, the BART Spices factory, which delighted the nostrils of the people of Totterdown or Redcliffe depending on the wind that day, shipped off to Avonmouth, leaving their site for developers.",https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/article9829278.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Inner-industrial-arc.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:02:04.750291

Facing an astonishing projected cash hole of $17 billion and a fierce counterattack from Google's Gemini, Altman was forced to activate the ""Code Red."" On one hand, there is an unprecedented financing plan of hundreds of billions of dollars; on the other hand, there is a financial crisis with the inference cost exceeding the revenue. Is this the inevitable path to AGI, or is it the eve of the bursting of the biggest bubble in Silicon Valley?

Under the spotlight of Silicon Valley, Altman is riding a unicycle while juggling more and more balls.

The picture is generated by Nano Banana Pro.

For the helmsman of OpenAI, merely creating an all - knowing chatbot seems to be too conservative.

To keep the investors waving their checks and the audience excited, he has to continuously come up with new concepts: self - developed chips, e - commerce integration, corporate consulting, and even consumer - grade hardware designed by Jony Ive.

However, the admission fee for this show is becoming astonishing.

In 2026, for the fastest - growing unicorn in history, it is destined to be a thrilling ""match point.""

According to leaked financial forecasts, OpenAI is expected to burn through $17 billion in cash in 2026, up from $9 billion in 2025.

What's even more alarming is that this loss trend is expected not to converge but to continue to accumulate in the next three years.

This is like a game of Russian roulette with cash flow.

The Appetite of the Money - Guzzler

Since ChatGPT burst onto the scene at the end of 2022, OpenAI has raised more than $60 billion from investors, setting a record for private companies.

But Altman's appetite is far from satisfied.

According to a core source, OpenAI is planning a new round of financing in 2026, targeting a whopping $100 billion, which could push the company's valuation to an astonishing $830 billion.

In comparison, its valuation was around $500 billion in October 2025.

The list of potential major investors in this round is star - studded and complex: Amazon is in talks to invest $10 billion, even though it is Microsoft's arch - rival in the cloud; Nvidia has also hinted that it may invest $100 billion in batches, of course, on the condition that the money will eventually flow back to Jensen Huang's pocket to buy graphics cards.

Behind this unprecedented financing frenzy is equally unprecedented growth and consumption.

In 2025, OpenAI's revenue was reported to have reached $13 billion, and the annualized rate at the end of the year was heading towards $20 billion.

It took Google and Facebook five and six years respectively to reach this milestone, while OpenAI achieved it in just two years.

But the concern is that there is a tight ""chain reaction"" between OpenAI's revenue growth and computing power costs.

The company's computing power demand has soared from 200 megawatts in 2023 to 1.9 gigawatts (GW) in 2025.

To satisfy its future ambitions, OpenAI has even signed a letter of intent to increase its computing power capacity by 30 gigawatts in the next few years, with a bill as high as $1.4 trillion.

As a venture capital tycoon said, asking about the ""burn rate"" has even become a taboo at the financing negotiation table.

The leaked data depicts a terrifying future: by 2029, OpenAI may have burned through a cumulative $115 billion.

When asked by long - time supporter Brad Gerstner how to fill the funding gap equivalent to 100 times the 2025 revenue, Altman responded with his characteristic toughness: ""If you want to sell your shares, I'll help you find a buyer.""

The Crocodiles in the Moat

The reason Altman must maintain this high - intensity expansion is that the crocodiles outside the moat have come ashore.

Although Altman insists that the marginal cost of model training will decrease as the scale expands, the reality is that competition is forcing costs to spiral upwards.

Benchmark tests by Stanford's HAI Institute show that the performance gap between top - tier models is rapidly narrowing.

The Gemini 3 model released by Google in November has outperformed OpenAI's GPT - 5.1 in multiple indicators.

Although OpenAI quickly countered with GPT - 5.2, this counterattack was far from a decisive blow.

Meanwhile, open - source models are also closing in step by step. Like a pack of wolves, they are tearing at the territory of closed - source models.

This pressure has been transmitted to user data. Sensor Tower's monitoring shows that as of mid - December, ChatGPT had 910 million monthly active users, still far ahead of Gemini's 345 million, but the growth engine seems to be stalling.

A study by Deutsche Bank points out that in major European countries, ChatGPT's consumer subscriptions stagnated in the summer.

Realizing the crisis, Altman launched the ""Code Red"" operation in early December, suspending miscellaneous items and focusing on shoring up ChatGPT's moat.

What worries the management even more is that according to leaked Microsoft data, in the first half of 2025, OpenAI's inference costs (i.e., the cost of running the model to answer user questions) actually exceeded its revenue.

In other words, the more users use it, the faster the company loses money.

Performing or Selling Out

To fill the huge financial hole, OpenAI is becoming more and more like the traditional tech giants it once tried to disrupt.

That once - pure AI laboratory is now bowing to ""advertisers.""

Although the ""Code Red"" temporarily shelved the advertising project, insiders confirmed that advertising will definitely be implanted in ChatGPT in 2026.

Through partnerships with Etsy and Walmart, it is trying to turn the chat box into a cash register.

Meanwhile, OpenAI has started learning ""vertical integration"" from Google.

In addition to collaborating with Broadcom to develop custom chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia, Altman is also trying to replicate Android's channel success by collaborating with Jony Ive to develop consumer - grade hardware, attempting to open up new traffic entrances outside of the iPhone.

On the enterprise side, OpenAI has established a large consulting department and launched tools such as AgentKit, trying to poach more sticky enterprise customers from competitor Anthropic.

Although the consumer business is still the mainstay at present, the proportion of revenue from the B - side is rising.

Bubble or Singularity?

Is OpenAI now the inevitable path to super - intelligence, or is it another WeWork on the verge of bursting due to over - expansion?

A venture capital director who invests in a competitor unceremoniously compared it to a ""steroid - pumped WeWork,"" implying that it could collapse at any time under huge debt and unrealistic growth expectations.

If enterprise - level sales fall short of expectations and ChatGPT fails to find more efficient monetization channels, this multi - billion - dollar empire could quickly disintegrate.

Currently, the capital market has started to vote with its feet, and listed companies deeply tied to OpenAI have been punished in both the stock and bond markets.

But in the primary market, the madness continues.

Altman once said in an interview that one of the reasons he wants to take OpenAI public is to see the short - sellers get crushed. ""I'd love to see them burned.""

This most - watched tightrope walker in 2026 still believes he can reach the other side.

For onlookers, this big show is about to reach its climax in 2026.

In an era where computing power is regarded as a belief, so - called valuation is just the ticket people pay for ""believing in the future.""

And the promise of AGI is like the Golden Fleece hanging on the edge of a cliff, tempting the Iasons to take a desperate leap before being reduced to ashes.

This decline coincided with the implementation of a sweeping price increase across its product portfolio, leaving market participants to question the potential impact on customer loyalty.

Amidst the pricing strategy shift, the company is advancing its hybrid AI platform. Since early December, the Mistral Large 3 language model, featuring 41 billion parameters, has been integrated into the watsonx environment. This allows enterprise clients to utilize external models alongside IBM's own Granite systems, a move designed to offer flexibility.

In a more significant strategic play, IBM has announced plans to acquire Confluent for $11 billion. The deal, targeted for completion in mid-2026, aims to secure dominance in real-time data streaming technology, a foundational element for generative AI applications. This combination of aggressive pricing and strategic M&A underscores a clear corporate focus on high-margin business segments.

Widespread Price Adjustments Take Effect

Effective January 1, IBM instituted an average price increase of six percent for a broad range of software and hardware. Affected products include Passport Advantage licenses, monthly IBM Z subscriptions, and storage systems. Certain cloud services and legacy support for Power hardware saw even steeper hikes of up to ten percent. Furthermore, basic support for cloud offerings, previously included, is now a paid add-on.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Company management frames the increases as a necessary response to inflationary pressures and a measure to stabilize revenue per customer. However, the skeptical market reaction suggests concerns that this aggressive pricing may backfire. With many corporations currently scrutinizing IT budgets, cost-sensitive enterprise clients may be prompted to consider alternative providers.

Insider Transactions Signal Board Confidence

SEC filings disclosed late Friday indicate sustained confidence within IBM's boardroom. Three directors—Michael Miebach, Frederick H. Waddell, and Thomas Buberl—received shares on December 31 as part of their deferred compensation programs. These transactions directly align the board members' financial interests with the company's long-term stock performance.

All Eyes on the Forthcoming Earnings Report

The market awaits crucial answers from IBM's fourth-quarter earnings report, scheduled for January 28, 2026. This disclosure is expected to provide management's assessment of the revenue implications from the Confluent acquisition and, more immediately, reveal early customer reactions to the new pricing structure. From a technical analysis perspective, the stock is currently testing the psychologically significant $290 support level. A sustained break below this point could place additional downward pressure on its 50-day moving average.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422414_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:58:27.342302

""They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,"" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider.
""Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,"" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider.
""Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.""
As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider.","From the outside, Saks Fifth Avenue — the century-old department store in Manhattan — is literally glowing, its façade decorated with thousands of glittering lights as part of its annual holiday display.

The shine, however, masks a retailer under pressure. On Friday, Saks named a new CEO, capping a tumultuous 12 months for the heavily leveraged department store owner. After months of restructurings, lawsuits, missed payments, and broken promises, Saks Global is now facing the possibility of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

What happens next could have consequences for customers. Brands — some of which haven't been paid in full for over a year — have paused shipments to Saks' stores, and creditors are awaiting news of its financial future.

In early December, Hilldun Corp., which acts as a sort of guarantor or insurer for brands, said it would no longer back shipments to Saks. The firm represents about 140 brands that sell to Saks — in the past, it's worked with big names like Tommy Hilfiger, Marc Jacobs, and A.L.C. — and supplies the retailer with at least $500 million worth of product annually.

Hilldun's delay was expected to be short-lived, but shipments were still on hold as 2025 came to a close amid growing reports that Saks Global, which also owns Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, was considering a court-supervised reorganization.

""They must do something very quickly to rectify this situation in the market, or they will not have a spring season,"" Gary Wassner, Hilldun's CEO, told Business Insider. ""Every order is on hold until Saks clarifies to the industry what they intend to do.""

Saks itself hasn't negated the bankruptcy talk.

""Together with our key financial stakeholders, we are exploring all potential paths to secure a strong and stable future,"" a spokesperson for Saks Global told Business Insider. ""Importantly, opportunities in the luxury market remain strong, and Saks Global continues to play a distinct and enduring role within it.""

To succeed, Saks' stores must not only resolve their debt issues, but continue to offer the assortment of luxury clothing, shoes, handbags, and beauty products that have long made its stores shopping paradises.

As things stand today, that's at risk, Mark Cohen, the former CEO of Sears Canada, told Business Insider. ""They aren't going to have goods on the shelf, certainly not new goods. This is a house of cards — from a financial point of view, from a merchandising point of view, from a customer profile point of view.""

A match made in luxury hell

2025 was supposed to be a great year for Saks.

For more than a decade, the retailer, with its large physical footprint, had struggled to maintain its dominance as shopping patterns shifted, with customers turning to e-commerce or brand-owned outlets. It wasn't alone: Nordstrom was treading water before it was taken private, and Macy's has endured a drawn-out turnaround plan.

Its problems intensified following the pandemic, when inflation and economic uncertainty curbed discretionary spending. By 2023, it began to face challenges in paying vendors.

Then, at the end of 2024, Saks finalized its $2.7 billion acquisition of Neiman Marcus Group, forming a luxury behemoth backed by the technology of Salesforce and Amazon, which took stakes in the new company as part of the deal. The move was seen as a solution to the beleaguered retailer's problems.

""It was touch-and-go up until the Neiman Marcus deal occurred,"" Wassner said. ""Everyone thought that would solve the cash flow problems.""

But the execution was messy.

The deal was financed by $2.2 billion worth of junk bonds — debt that carries high interest rates — which S&P Global called ""unsustainable."" It left the company strapped for cash, leading to a round of layoffs to start the year (multiple more would follow).

One of the first red flags for Saks arose on Valentine's Day, when vendors, who Wassner estimates are owed hundreds of millions, received an I-love-you-not from then-Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick.

He told them that they'd have to wait. Saks would pay its overdue bills — in some cases, more than a year past due — in installments stretched over 12 months that wouldn't begin until summer.

Vendors, some of whom were burned by similar communications prior to the 2019 bankruptcy of the iconic department store Barney's, were left between a rock and a hard place.

One vendor, who said he is owed six figures, called the situation ""agony.""

""We thought it was going to be a smoother transition and that this was going to be a global luxury masterpiece in the making,"" the person said. ""That just did not happen.""

Brands could withhold inventory shipments — which would risk ruining relationships with a core customer and put more strain on Saks' balance sheet — or continue business as usual and hope for the best.

Those who chose the latter were further disappointed in July, when the payment schedule wasn't met.

That month, Saks' financial vulnerability was made clear when a nine-figure interest payment prompted a debt restructuring. A majority of bondholders agreed to provide cash in return for being moved up on the retailer's cap table. Basically, meaning that if (or when) Saks files for bankruptcy, those bondholders get first dibs — likely before any vendors.

""I will say the biggest part of it has been the mental cruelty of this situation, waking up, not knowing what's going to happen, trying to keep things going,"" the vendor who spoke to Business Insider said.

A looming spring season

In the fall, things had dissolved to the point that several labels were withholding inventory.

S&P analysts wrote that Saks had a ""less-than-adequate in-stock inventory position."" In October, the company lowered its earnings guidance for the year, blaming inventory challenges.

""You are going to ship to somebody you know you're going to get paid from,"" Tim Hynes, the global head of credit research at Debtwire, told Business Insider. ""You will give Saks what's left, you're not going to give them the best.""

Some brands went even further, taking direct aim at Saks.

Skincare brand Sunday Riley said it threatened to sue if payments were not made, Retail Dive reported in August.

In October, Jovani Fashion, the dressmaker made famous by ""Real Housewives of New York"" star Luann de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against Saks Global — a rare step in a relationship-driven industry. Jovani said Saks owed $295,651 for merchandise it accepted this year. (Saks has denied wrongdoing.)

By the end of the year, murmurs of a potential bankruptcy filing made headlines. They intensified on the last day of the year, when The Wall Street Journal reported that Saks had missed a nine-figure interest payment, according to people familiar with it.

""It's time to solve the problems one way or another,"" Wassner said.

Bankruptcy isn't the only option. The company has billions of dollars in real estate that it can sell — it recently sold the land beneath its Beverly Hills location — and can close down unproductive stores, as it did with several Saks Off 5th locations and has floated doing with the Neiman Marcus in Dallas. The retailer's store names still hold cultural cache, and deep-pocketed investors could step in to enhance the shopping experience.

Cohen, the former Sears exec, doesn't expect Saks to close Bergdorf's or that famous Fifth Avenue location anytime soon, but there's still a long road ahead.

""They're not getting merchandise freely. They've had enormous upheaval in management. The luxury business, generally speaking, is not robust at the moment, and we're going into a year, 2026, which has all the makings of an honest-to- god recession,"" he said. ""Is there sunshine here? I don't think so.""

Pat Gelsinger, the former CEO of Intel, said in a recent interview that quantum computing will become popular within two years and accelerate the bursting of the AI bubble, and will completely replace GPUs before 2030. In his view, quantum computing, classical computing, and AI computing will together form the ""holy trinity"" of the future computing world.

On December 9th, QuantWare, a quantum hardware startup, officially released a new quantum processor (QPU) expansion architecture, VIO - 40K, and plans to achieve mass production of quantum chips in 2026. At its headquarters in Delft, the Netherlands, the company is actively building Kilofab - the world's largest and first wafer fab dedicated to quantum chip production. It is reported that this will increase its production capacity by 20 times compared to the current level.

At the beginning of 2025, Jensen Huang joked that ""quantum technology is at least 20 years away from practical application."" However, by the end of the year, the roadmaps of various quantum startups and giants were becoming more and more aggressive, and the predictions of the media and institutions also began to turn optimistic.

Undoubtedly, 2026 will be a crucial year for quantum computing to move towards practical application. And now is a good time to sort out the technology and review the market.

Let's first take a look at what happened in the quantum industry in 2025.

01 The Quantum Explosion in 2025

In 2025, the main players on the quantum stage can be summarized as: three tech giants, the ""Quantum Four"", and NVIDIA.

Google: After releasing the Willow superconducting quantum processor with 105 physical qubits at the end of 2024, Google officially announced the achievement of ""verifiable quantum advantage"" in October 2025. By running the ""Quantum Echo"" algorithm, the Willow chip was 13,000 times faster than classical supercomputers in processing out - of - order time correlator tasks. Experimental data further showed that as the scale of physical qubits increased, the logical error rate of the system decreased exponentially, verifying the effectiveness of the error - correction theory at the physical level.

In terms of the ecosystem, Google deepened its cooperation with NVIDIA, using the CUDA - Q platform for large - scale physical simulations to solve the noise design problems of next - generation processors. In addition, Google reached a cooperation with the UK National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), opening cloud access to the Willow chip for UK research institutions to support algorithm testing in fields such as materials science.

IBM: In 2025, IBM continued to implement its hardware iteration roadmap, focusing on improving processor performance and reducing the cost of the control system. In terms of hardware, IBM released and delivered a 120 - qubit processor codenamed ""Nighthawk"". This chip uses a new - generation tunable coupler, with a computing performance approximately 20% higher than its predecessor, ""Heron"". At the same time, IBM introduced an experimental chip called ""Loon"" to verify the stability of large - scale fault - tolerant components.

In terms of the engineering control architecture, IBM announced the results of its cooperation with AMD in October of the same year. The two sides used AMD's existing commercial FPGA chips to achieve real - time error - correction control of qubits. Tests showed that the processing speed of this solution met the requirements for real - time error correction, and the project progress was completed one year ahead of schedule. This progress demonstrated that general - purpose commercial chips can replace customized hardware for quantum control, which helps reduce the engineering cost of building fault - tolerant quantum computers and supports IBM's plan for fault - tolerant models in 2029.

Microsoft: In February 2025, Microsoft released its first quantum chip, ""Majorana 1"", based on topological superconductor materials. This product marked that Microsoft's long - term investment in the topological quantum computing route had entered the hardware prototype stage from theoretical research. Microsoft stated that the chip uses the characteristics of new materials to achieve immunity to environmental noise at the physical level. Although the current qubit scale is small, the release of this prototype verified the feasibility of the topological protection mechanism at the hardware level, providing an experimental basis for subsequent expansion.

The ""Quantum Four"" (IonQ, Rigetti, D - Wave, QCI): In 2025, listed quantum computing companies represented by IonQ, Rigetti, D - Wave, and Quantum Computing (QCI) underwent market integration and business adjustments. IonQ completed the acquisition of UK startup Oxford Ionics in June, involving an amount of approximately $1.1 billion, aiming to integrate ion - trap technology patents and expand the engineering team. Rigetti Computing continued to advance the modular deployment of superconducting systems and optimized the interconnection performance of the Ankaa - 3 processor. D - Wave focused on demonstrating the hybrid solving ability of quantum annealing technology in logistics scheduling and supply - chain optimization. In addition, Quantum Computing continued to explore in the field of photonics, aiming to lower the environmental threshold for system operation.

NVIDIA: In 2025, NVIDIA underwent a strategic correction in the quantum field. From doubting quantum computing at the beginning of the year, Jensen Huang publicly apologized at the GTC Summit in March and established the strategic position of quantum computing. Subsequently, NVIDIA quickly initiated capital operations.

In September, NVentures, a subsidiary of NVIDIA, continuously made significant investments in three technology routes within a week: participating in the nearly $600 million financing of Quantinuum (ion - trap), supporting QuEra (neutral atoms), and following the $1 billion Series E financing of PsiQuantum (photonic quantum). This combination of moves aimed to cover the mainstream hardware modalities through capital rather than self - developing QPUs.

At the GTC Conference in Washington at the end of the year, NVIDIA launched NVQLink, enabling direct communication between the QPU of quantum computers and GPUs. Jensen Huang pointed out that the QPU of quantum computing has received unprecedented support, and currently, 17 quantum computing companies and 8 US Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories have joined the NVIDIA ecosystem.

02 A Series of Highlights in 2026

Based on the technology roadmaps of major manufacturers and the predictions of industry analysis institutions, 2026 is regarded as a crucial node for quantum computing to move from engineering verification to utility verification. The industry's focus will shift from simply expanding the scale of physical qubits to verifying the quality of logical qubits and the actual deployment of hybrid computing architectures.

In the superconducting route, IBM has set 2026 as a crucial year to demonstrate ""quantum advantage"" in its plan. The company plans to use a ""quantum - centric supercomputing"" architecture to try to prove its cost or accuracy advantage over classical computers in specific scientific tasks. Its processor is expected to support deeper - level quantum gate operations (targeting about 7,500 gates) to run more complex algorithms. Google, on the other hand, faces the engineering challenge of transitioning from verifying error - correction principles to building long - lived logical qubits, focusing on further improving the coherence time and gate fidelity of physical qubits.

In the emerging routes, the neutral - atom manufacturer QuEra Computing has set the goal of releasing a system with 100 logical qubits; the photonic - quantum manufacturer PsiQuantum is accelerating the assembly of its ultra - large - scale systems in Chicago and Brisbane and is expected to enter a crucial system integration stage in 2026; and QuantWare has launched the plan for the Kilofab wafer fab, attempting to promote the industrial mass production of quantum chips. All of the above plans have high engineering uncertainties, and 2026 will be a test period to verify whether these aggressive goals can be achieved.

With the promotion of middleware platforms such as NVIDIA's CUDA - Q, ""Quantum - classical hybrid computing"" may become the standard deployment mode in data centers in 2026. QPUs will be more integrated as accelerators into high - performance computing clusters to handle specific simulation or optimization tasks. The popularization of this architecture will promote the combination of quantum computing and AI workflows, especially in the fields of large - model training optimization and complex molecular simulation. The industry expects to see more application tests based on hybrid computing power.

In the field of cloud services, IBM, AWS, and Microsoft currently provide quantum access services. In 2026, cloud providers may further integrate ""quantum + classical"" hybrid resources. The service model will evolve from providing single experimental hardware access to providing a hybrid computing environment integrated with high - performance computing resources. The threshold for enterprise users to call quantum computing power through the cloud platform to solve practical problems is expected to be lowered, but whether it can generate a positive return on investment in large - scale commercial scenarios remains to be seen.

At the security level, the US government is forcing the anti - quantum upgrade of digital infrastructure. According to the strategic deployment of the National Security Memorandum (NSM - 10), US federal agencies have entered the actual implementation stage of post - quantum cryptography (PQC) migration. The White House requires agencies to accelerate the phasing out of traditional encryption algorithms such as RSA and has set 2025 - 2030 as the critical window period for core systems to complete PQC upgrades. This initiative aims to establish the US's leading position in formulating the next - generation encryption standard and drive the reconstruction of defense systems in key fields such as finance and national defense.

This also reflects the fact that the quantum computing competition in 2026 will not only take place at the enterprise level but also between major countries around the world.

03 Countries Are Building Quantum Industrial Systems

Looking forward to 2026, as major global economies enter a new policy cycle, the development logic of quantum computing is undergoing profound changes. The focus of countries is gradually shifting from the early competition in single scientific research indicators to building a resilient industrial system and mastering the core links of the industrial chain.

The US strategic focus in 2026 has shifted to strengthening its internal industrial foundation. In response to the labor - force gap risk pointed out by the non - profit organization ""QED - C"", the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is expected to accelerate the cultivation of quantum industry clusters in places such as Colorado. Different from mainly funding basic scientific research in the past, the R & D budget orientation for the 2027 fiscal year shows that US policies are more focused on cultivating skilled technical workers and engineers and exploring new support models, including equity - for - capital, aiming to build a complete local industrial closed - loop from R & D to manufacturing to address the talent shortage in the fields of cryogenic electronics and microwave engineering.

2026 is the starting year of China's 15th Five - Year Plan, and quantum technology is positioned as a ""new economic growth point"" in the relevant planning suggestions, which implies that China's quantum industry is accelerating the transition from laboratory verification to industrial cultivation. At the infrastructure level, China's industrial community is exploring the integration of quantum computing into the national - level computing power network, relying on the ""East - West Computing"" project. China Telecom Quantum and Origin Quantum and other enterprises are expected to further pilot the ""integration of four types of computing"", namely quantum + supercomputing + intelligent computing + general computing, trying to use the real needs of public scenarios such as weather forecasting and power grid scheduling to drive technological iteration.

In terms of industrial chain construction, Chinese enterprises are committed to building a full - stack autonomous ecosystem. Manufacturers represented by Liangi Technology are promoting the R & D and verification of key components such as dilution refrigerators and special cables. At the same time, the photonic - quantum route is also being accelerated. Turing Quantum and other complete - machine manufacturers are exploring differentiated applications in the fields of AI and biomedicine, while Tengjing Technology provides solid underlying hardware support for this route through the R & D of precision optical components.

Europe and the UK are also accelerating the implementation of the ""technological sovereignty"" strategy. The UK has promised to continuously invest funds to support the quantum industry, relying on domestic enterprises such as ORCA Computing to build an internationally competitive industrial high - ground. The EU tends to support domestic companies in building quantum chip foundry facilities, trying to gain more say in the chip manufacturing link and build an industrial ""third pole"" with independent innovation capabilities.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260104/v2_d7c0fc1ecbf94f98a970f834b29d1781@5888275@ai_oswg1134118oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:58:38.014030

In the United States, retail CEO exits reached between 41 and 43 by late 2024, a more than 100% increase compared to the previous year. Similarly, in Mexico, at least nine major firms, including Walmart de México, FEMSA, and Grupo Bimbo, replaced their top leadership during the second half of the year.

“This period of CEO turnovers may seem like a coincidence, but each movement follows its own fundamentals. In reality, in Mexico we are accustomed to very long management trajectories, and that amplifies the perception of change. In any case, change is usually healthy,” says independent analyst Marcela Muñoz to El Economista.

Internal Promotion Trends

Boards of directors continue to favor internal candidates to provide cultural alignment and institutional knowledge. About 67% of CEO appointments across the S&P 500 in 2025 came from within the organizations, although this is a decrease from 74% in 2023 and 82% in 2022.

Major US retailers Walmart and Target both selected insiders for their top roles. Walmart appointed John Furner, the company’s number two executive, to succeed Doug McMillon. Furner and McMillon both began their careers at entry levels within individual stores. At Target, Michael Fiddelke was selected to succeed Brian Cornell in 2026. Fiddelke is a company veteran who oversaw logistics and sourcing.

In Mexico, several firms followed a similar path. At FEMSA, José Antonio Fernández Garza-Lagüera was appointed as part of a long-anticipated succession plan, as previously reported by MBN. At La Comer, Héctor de la Barreda took over as CEO, while his predecessor, Santiago García, moved to the Board of Directors. Roberto Solano, Manager of Analysis, Monex, says that these internal moves strengthen the ""core business"" as new leaders bring visions based on experience within the same company.

The leadership changes in Mexico coincide with a period of low economic dynamism. Data from the National Association of Self-Service and Department Stores (ANTAD) shows that accumulated sales grew 3.3% between January and September 2025, down from 4.6% in the same period of 2024.

Several high-profile appointments were confirmed in the final quarter of 2025:

El Palacio de Hierro: Éléonore de Boysson was named general director, becoming the first woman to lead the department store chain.

Grupo Bimbo: Rafael Pamias resigned for health and personal reasons.

Mondelez México: Carlos Veraza was appointed general director in July 2025, replacing Oriol Bonaclocha, who transitioned to CEO of Heineken Mexico.

Alsea: The restaurant operator replaced its general director as part of a long-term succession strategy and to manage a more demanding consumer environment.

Macroeconomic and Regulatory Pressures

The new leadership teams face immediate regulatory and economic challenges. In Mexico, companies are preparing for labor reforms, including the gradual reduction of the work week from 48 to 40 hours by 2030 and significant minimum wage increases. In 2025, the minimum wage rose by 12% to MX$419.88 (US$23.48) daily in the Northern Border Zone and MX$278.80 in the rest of the country.

Retailers also face fiscal and trade pressures. Bottlers like Coca-Cola FEMSA are managing a MX$3.08 increase in the Special Tax on Production and Services (IEPS) for sugary drinks. Furthermore, department stores and supermarkets face proposed import tariffs of between 10% and 50% on products such as textiles, footwear, and electronics from countries without trade agreements with Mexico.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/charlesdeluvio-Lks7vei-eAg-unsplash.jpg?h=78d8cc56&itok=OieC8rKZ,N,,2026-01-04 09:03:32.499382

Branch / InsideSources.com (TNS),,,,,https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2026/jan/03/perspective-meet-the-ai-agents-of-2026-ambitious/,"If 2025 was the year artificial intelligence became unavoidable, 2026 will be the year everyone starts talking seriously about AI agents.

The question for 2026 is not whether AI agents will be regulated, but whether oversight will arrive before harm becomes normalized.","If 2025 was the year artificial intelligence became unavoidable, 2026 will be the year everyone starts talking seriously about AI agents.

An AI agent is a software system designed to plan and execute tasks autonomously, make decisions and interact with digital tools or environments with minimal human oversight in pursuit of a defined goal. When people fear that AI will take over jobs, they are usually worried about white-collar automation. The more immediate question is not what AI agents might do someday; it is who is pushing them now, and to what end.

Tech companies are aggressively marketing AI agents as autonomous digital workers that can plan tasks, execute goals and manage workflows with minimal human input. Corporate leaders echo these claims, framing agents as productivity multipliers and cost-saving measures.

In many cases, this enthusiasm reflects less a genuine breakthrough in capability than a familiar pattern: vendors racing to define the next category of enterprise software before regulators, workers or consumers have time to assess the risks.

The reality will be far less dramatic.

In 2026, AI agents will be everywhere in corporate decks and keynote speeches, but far less impressive in practice. Despite the hype, these systems remain unreliable and heavily dependent on human supervision.

They are not autonomous employees. They are closer to junior staffers who work quickly, confidently and often incorrectly, requiring constant review and cleanup. The problem is that Big Tech is pushing to deploy these agents at scale, often without adequate training, safeguards or clear human accountability.

That gap between promise and performance is already becoming visible. Studies and industry surveys consistently show that while AI tools are being rapidly deployed across private companies, few organizations are using them well.

Instead of boosting productivity, many firms report new inefficiencies: duplicated work, increased oversight burdens and time spent correcting AI-generated errors. In practice, AI systems often function less as productivity tools and more as justifications for cutting costs, shifting risk and lowering standards.

AI agents intensify this problem. Unlike chatbots that respond to discrete prompts, agents are designed to take initiative. They chain actions together and make decisions without constant human input. That autonomy is precisely what makes them appealing and risky. When agents hallucinate facts, misunderstand goals or act on flawed assumptions, errors cascade. For consumers, this can mean misinformation.

This is why trust remains the central barrier to agent adoption. AI agents cannot be trusted to operate independently in high-stakes environments such as finance, health care, legal services or government. They struggle with judgment and context, and they lack the institutional awareness humans rely on to navigate ambiguity. Yet, companies are increasingly positioning agents as authoritative interfaces, blurring the line between assistance and influence.

The result is a paradox. Companies invest in AI agents to reduce workload, but end up creating new layers of review and oversight. Employees must check outputs line by line. Managers must audit decisions after the fact. Compliance teams must anticipate errors, harder to trace because responsibility is split between humans and machines.

None of this means AI agents are useless. Like junior employees, they can be valuable when used appropriately. They excel at narrow, well-defined tasks. They can draft, summarize, organize and assist at scale. However, they are not ready to be trusted with end-to-end responsibility. Treating them as autonomous workers rather than tools is a category error that 2026 will make increasingly obvious.

By the end of 2026, the conversation around AI agents will begin to mature. The hype will cool. Executives will talk less about autonomy and more about supervision and ""co-piloting."" The most successful organizations will be those that treat AI agents not as replacements, but as trainees, useful only within clear boundaries and strong accountability structures.

AI agents may one day live up to their promise. But in 2026, they will still be learning the job.

Most importantly, if AI agents are deployed at scale, they must be governed as systems that shape rights, access and economic power — not treated as experiments run on the public. Regulators should require meaningful testing, clear lines of accountability and enforceable limits on how agents interact with consumers.

The question for 2026 is not whether AI agents will be regulated, but whether oversight will arrive before harm becomes normalized.

Estée Lauder also clearly pointed out in its financial report that many of its high - end perfume brands even achieved double - digit growth.
However, focusing on the high - end perfume raw material business, Givaudan increased by 18.7% year - on - year.
In December, the LVMH Group invested in BDK Parfums, a French niche fragrance brand.
For example, TSG, a consumer private equity fund, acquired Phlur, a niche high - end fragrance brand.","Amid the general slowdown of the global beauty market and the impact of geopolitics, L'Oréal acquired Creed, a top - tier salon fragrance brand under the Kering Group, for a sky - high price of 4 billion euros (approximately 32.82 billion yuan), revealing the most certain bet direction of the giants for the future.

In addition, in 2025, LVMH took a stake in BDK Parfums, and Estée Lauder made its first investment in a Mexican brand, XINÚ, in Latin America.

Behind the intensive layout actions of leading enterprises, on the one hand, it not only reshapes the competitive landscape of the global perfume market but also highlights the strong growth resilience of this category in the consumer wave.

On the other hand, in the corporate chessboard, perfume has been upgraded from an add - on category to a strategic stronghold for market competition. The competition logic is shifting from a stock game to the exploration of new growth.

Under the slowing growth, is niche high - end perfume the next breakout point?

Currently, although the perfume - related businesses from raw material suppliers to brand owners are still in a growth trend, the growth rate has significantly slowed down. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ""high - endization"" has become the key engine to resist cyclical fluctuations, contributing the most certain growth in the financial reports of giants.

As shown in the following figure, compared with before, Hermès and Coty, whose perfume businesses used to boost their performance, saw a year - on - year decline of 7.2% and 6% respectively in the third quarter of this year, in sharp contrast to the 9.3% increase in 2024. At the same time, the perfume business growth of L'Oréal, Puig, etc. also did not exceed 3%, indicating a significant weakening of growth momentum.

Even so, many enterprises said that their high - end perfume brands achieved considerable growth, becoming highlights of their performance. Among the strategic brands of the Shiseido Group's Next5, the perfume brands Issey Miyake and Narciso Rodriguez increased by 16% and 13% year - on - year respectively. Estée Lauder also clearly pointed out in its financial report that many of its high - end perfume brands even achieved double - digit growth.

This is verified in the upstream of the industrial chain. Compared with the previous double - digit growth, international fragrance and flavor giants generally showed weakness in the first three quarters of 2025. Except for the slight increase in sales of Givaudan and IFF, DSM - Firmenich and Symrise declined year - on - year.

However, focusing on the high - end perfume raw material business, Givaudan increased by 18.7% year - on - year.

It can be seen that high - end perfume has stronger anti - cyclical ability and market attractiveness, which also provides clear guidance for the strategic layout of international beauty enterprises. In order to restart the growth engine, enterprises have increased their investment in perfume and focused their investment on this niche segment with still room for growth.

Led by L'Oréal, the perfume track remains hot!

Despite facing macro - level pressures, the global perfume market has a promising future. According to relevant data from Mordor Intelligence, the fragrance market was worth 76.71 billion US dollars (approximately 540.5 billion yuan) in 2025 and is expected to reach 112.46 billion US dollars (approximately 792.4 billion yuan) by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate of 7.95% during the forecast period.

Against this broad prospect, international beauty groups and upstream suppliers have accelerated their layout.

In 2025, there were over 10 investments in perfume and fragrance

In 2025, industrial capital represented by L'Oréal, Estée Lauder, and LVMH was particularly active. According to an incomplete statistics by Jumeili, there were more than ten investments and acquisitions of perfume brands globally. Among them, equity investment became the mainstream method, indicating that capital aims to establish long - term and in - depth strategic partnerships rather than simple financial investments.

Among them, L'Oréal's layout was the most coherent and aggressive. It successively invested in two high - end perfume brands within a month and also obtained the operation rights of the beauty and perfume of a fashion brand, quickly supplementing its high - end portfolio.

Subsequently, in October, through a historic cooperation with the Kering Group, L'Oréal brought Creed, a representative of high - end niche fragrances with a history of over 200 years, under its wing. This deal marked the ultimate layout of L'Oréal in the niche perfume field.

In addition, Estée Lauder and the LVMH Group also followed closely, but with different strategies, investing in perfume brands with strong regional characteristics and focusing on raw material quality respectively.

In November, Estée Lauder made a strategic minority equity investment in XINÚ, a niche luxury brand from Mexico, taking a fancy to its unique Latin American plant fragrance sources and cultural narrative.

In December, the LVMH Group invested in BDK Parfums, a French niche fragrance brand. This brand focuses on returning to the essence, emphasizing high - quality raw materials, adhering to handmade production, and conveying a unique artistic perspective and sensory narrative.

International luxury brands are keen to seize the differential value of the niche high - end fragrance track through equity investment, while upstream raw material giants tend to directly consolidate the supply chain and regional markets through acquisitions.

For example, Givaudan, a fragrance and flavor giant, successively acquired perfume and fragrance companies Vollmens Fragrances and Belle Aire Creations within three months to strengthen its position in the North American and Brazilian markets.

In addition to the above two groups eyeing the ""cake"" of perfume, many private equities and funds are also involved.

However, different from beauty enterprises focusing on single - category perfume brands, funds and investment companies are more optimistic about home fragrance brands close to daily life.

For example, TSG, a consumer private equity fund, acquired Phlur, a niche high - end fragrance brand. In addition to perfume, Phlur's product line also includes body sprays, hand creams, candles, etc.

Source: Phlur official website

Similarly, Homecourt, a high - end home fragrance brand founded by actress Courteney Cox, also received 8 million US dollars (approximately 56.337 million yuan) in Series A financing. Since its establishment in 2022, the brand's product line has expanded from the home field to body care and laundry products.

Behind these intensive investment actions, three core trends can be found:

Firstly, with limited growth in popular mass - market perfumes, capital is flowing more towards niche categories. In essence, against the backdrop of the fading traffic dividend, ""niche"" high - end perfumes with unique brand stories, rare fragrance types, and niche cultures have become the targets for giants to bet on the future and obtain differential value.

Secondly, the investment logic varies according to the nature of capital. Equity investments by beauty groups aim to complete the brand puzzle and acquire strategic growth points; acquisitions by raw material suppliers aim to control the core supply chain; while private equity funds prefer the extension of product lines for more stable returns.

Thirdly, scene - based consumption is expanding the boundaries of the track. Compared with traditional perfumes, home fragrances have a wider audience and product chain. Due to their higher frequency of use and stronger emotional value, they are attracting new capital to enter the market.

Investing up to 1.2 billion yuan in R & D factories

In addition to investing in promising perfume brands, international giants are looking upstream and focusing on building core capabilities at the R & D end.

Specifically, as a consumer goods giant, Unilever has not made new moves in investing in perfume brands, but in May this year, it invested 80 million pounds (approximately 753 million yuan) to build a new fragrance R & D facility in the UK. Two months later, it opened a new fragrance laboratory in the US. This series of actions shows that building independent and cutting - edge olfactory R & D capabilities has become a key part of leading enterprises in the industry.

In addition, from a geographical perspective, France, with its long - standing perfume history, has also become the best location for leading enterprises to build factories.

Chanel invested 150 million euros (approximately 1.241 billion yuan) to build a new perfume production base in France to consolidate its perfume industrial chain.

L'Oréal added an investment of 60 million euros (approximately 496 million yuan) to its Gosselies factory in northern France to provide strong manufacturing support for its perfume brands.

Estée Lauder opened a global perfume workshop in Paris, aiming to bring together top perfumers and creative talents to accelerate the innovation and commercialization of perfume art.

From the above, it can be seen that enterprises are no longer satisfied with acquiring ready - made brand stories but are directly investing in the source of creating stories. Meanwhile, future perfume competition is not only about competing for consumers' perception of a single product but also about upgrading R & D technology. Building higher technical barriers and stable production capacity supply has become the key bargaining chip for leading enterprises to consolidate their industry position and seize future growth opportunities.

The talent war: the key engine driving the ""olfactory economy""

Beyond strategic investment and supply chain layout, the upgrade of the talent structure has become a key move for leading groups to compete in the high - end perfume market.

In 2025, there were more than 10 changes in perfume business executives in the industry, from Hermès, the LVMH Group to Coty.

For example, in April this year, Creed, a brand under the Kering Group, appointed a former Estée Lauder executive as its CEO. It is reported that Nathalie Berger - Duquene has more than 20 years of relevant work experience and has held important positions in many international beauty enterprises such as Estée Lauder and L'Oréal.

Similarly, after emerging from bankruptcy, Revlon also poached a former Estée Lauder executive in October. It announced that Amber Garrison would serve as the President of the Elizabeth Arden brand and global perfume business. It is reported that Amber Garrison has rich experience in skin care, perfume, brand transformation, etc. and once served as the Global Brand President of Origins.

In addition, there were changes in the top management of niche perfume brands. For example, Marc - André Heller replaced the co - founder as the CEO of Memo Paris; Patrice Béliard took over as the CEO of niche fragrance brands Parfums de Marly and Initio Parfums Privés.

All of the above indicate that the current competition among leading enterprises in the ""olfactory"" field has reached a white - hot stage, and the competition in the perfume field has deepened from a game of capital and resources to a core competition of organizational capabilities and strategic thinking.

Although the competition is becoming increasingly fierce, it is certain that perfume will still be a category favored by most enterprises in the future. As Yan Ming, the managing partner of Xiuyuan Capital, also recognized the potential of this market. ""The fragrance field is still full of opportunities, especially fragrance products that contain cultural elements and can convey emotional value. Due to the emphasis on emotional value of such products, their growth process may be relatively slow, but once successful, they will also be more stable, and the two are complementary.""

Although the growth of single - category products purely centered on fragrance has slowed down, the integrated innovation of ""fragrance +"" has become the core model for exploring new growth.

As a sensory element, fragrance is being systematically integrated into categories such as skin care, household cleaning, and health care, creating composite products with both functional attributes and emotional resonance. In the future, the growth potential of the ""olfactory economy"" is expected to be continuously released.

Only one investment: is the Chinese perfume track facing a cold spell?

While international giants have occupied the headlines with their intensive capital actions, the Chinese perfume investment market in 2025 showed a ""calm"" on the data level. Public information shows that only EvoSensation, a new - style fragrance brand from Yunnan, completed its angel - round financing throughout the year, but neither the investment amount nor the investor was disclosed.

Looking back over time, most domestic perfume track investments occurred around 2022. Among them, the more attention - grabbing ones are Documents and Scentooze, which received investments from L'Oréal in 2022 and 2024 respectively, and Melt Season, which received tens of millions of yuan in strategic investment from the Estée Lauder Group in 2023. It is worth noting that the path for these three brands to gain capital recognition is to build an irreplicable high - end brand value centered on a unique oriental cultural narrative.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260104/v2_b86cb38e791c411a8d7cb75b046ea629@1743780481@ai_oswg1166121oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 01:58:04.109869

Three of the five — Amphenol, Alphabet and Reddit — have ties to artificial intelligence, which is expected to remain a major investment theme in 2026.

All five stocks are holding up despite a weak culmination to trading in 2025. The market generally rose Friday to start the new year, though software weighed on the Nasdaq. At the moment, IBD is recommending 60%-80% exposure, and these stocks to watch could be actionable soon.

Amphenol Among Stocks To Watch

Amphenol is forming a double-bottom base with a 143.48 buy point. Investors trying to get ahead of that entry can use the Dec. 26 high at 138.32. Shares traded just above that level Friday. Although shares have rallied more than 80% from the last breakout in May, the current base is still an early-stage pattern.

The company — Wednesday's IBD Stock of the Day — is riding at least two hot investing themes: data centers and aviation.

Amphenol makes interconnect products, fiber-optic connectors, antennas, sensors and specialty cables. Surging demand for data centers and the connectors for those operations has been a main driver of Amphenol's growth.

The company is a leader in high-performance connectors for military and commercial aircraft. Geopolitical tensions and airline demand for higher-efficiency planes are driving growth in those markets.

In addition, Amphenol has been on an acquisition spree, buying up AI infrastructure, defense electronics and industrial automation companies. Last year, Amphenol acquired CommScope's (COMM) connectivity business for $10.5 billion. In November, it closed the $1 billion deal for Trexon, a maker of high-strength cable assembly products for military equipment.

Amphenol will announce fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 28 after the close. Analysts expect earnings to climb 67% to 92 cents a share. Sales are expected to increase 42% to $6.131 billion, according to FactSet.

Earnings and revenue growth have accelerated for several quarters.

The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible. The stock has a moderate 21-day average true range (ATR) of 2.57%. The average true range, available on IBD MarketSurge, gauges the characteristic breadth of a stock's behavior. Stocks with a high ATR tend to make large price moves that can trigger sell rules. Stocks with lower ATRs tend to make more incremental moves.

Google Stock On Track For New Base

Alphabet shares are forming a flat base with a 328.83 buy point. It is the first new base to appear on the chart since the stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at 197.95 in August. Shares briefly flashed an early entry on Friday, bouncing off the 21-day line, but pared gains. Friday's high of 322.50 can serve as a slightly aggressive buy point now.

The parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo and Gemini is still the No. 1 stock in the internet content industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. It has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Alphabet's earnings grew 36% in 2024 and are expected to have increased 32% in 2025.

The stock rose 65% last year thanks to its investments in artificial intelligence. But as the company continues to pour cash into AI, analysts now expect EPS growth to slow to 6%, to $11.24 billion, in 2026. Revenue is expected to grow about 14% in 2026 to $454.8 billion.

Google overhauled its search results in response to new competition from OpenAI's ChatGPT and others. As Alphabet seeks to remain a dominant player in AI, last month it announced plans to acquire Intersect Power, a data center and clean energy infrastructure company, for $4.75 billion in cash plus debt. Alphabet is also getting into quantum computing.

Analysts polled by FactSet expect fourth-quarter earnings to climb 32% to $2.63 a share. Sales are seen rising 15% to $111 billion.

Google stock has a mild ATR of 2.07%.

Evercore Another Stock To Watch

Evercore shares climbed past the 349.91 buy point of a cup-with-handle base on Dec. 22. But the breakout never got going. After fading at the end of 2025, shares reclaimed the buy point on Friday. Also, another handle entry has appeared at 353.30. Shares are holding above the 21-day exponential moving average, a positive sign while the stock tries to get traction.

New York-based Evercore — the fourth-largest investment banking advisor in the world — beat Q3 estimates thanks to strong M&A activity. Advisory fees jumped 49% to $290.7 million, mainly due to higher revenue from large transactions during 2025, the firm said.

Analysts believe the company is on sound footing for 2026 amid favorable conditions for wealth brokers and independent investment banks.

The firm has made the Middle East a focus of its expansion. In December, it received a license to work in Saudi Arabia. Evercore opened an office in Dubai in 2017 and also has operations in the Americas, Europe and Asia.

Evercore was founded in 1995 by Roger Altman, an investment banker who served as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury under President Bill Clinton. During the Jimmy Carter administration, he held another senior post at the Treasury. Altman remains senior chairman at Evercore.

Analysts' consensus earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $4.10 in earnings per share, an increase of 20.1%. Revenue is expected to climb 14.6% to $1.123 billion, per FactSet. The date of the report hasn't been announced.

Evercore has a 94 Composite Rating and an ATR of 2.88.

Stocks To Watch: Reddit Forms Bullish Pattern

Reddit stock is working on a cup-with-handle base. Shares are 3% away from the 246.15 buy point. The base shows a drop of 39% from peak to trough, which is deeper than usual. Yet, Reddit is no stranger to deep patterns. It formed a cup base from July to October 2024 and still nearly tripled from the buy point.

On Friday, RDDT stock broke a downtrend within the handle as well as a trendline from the top of the base, both offering early entries.

The online discussion platform monetizes its business mainly through advertising on its app and website. Daily active unique users were 116 million in the third quarter, an increase of 19% from a year earlier. Average revenue per unique user rose 41% to $5.04 in the quarter.

San Francisco-based Reddit grew earnings per share 400% in Q3, and analysts expect EPS to rise 159% to 93 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Revenue is expected to jump 68% to $655.6 million, according to MarketSurge data.

Analysts Bullish On Reddit

Analysts are bullish on the company's 2026 prospects as posts from Reddit gain ground in AI-powered search results. Needham analyst Laura Martin on Monday said in a note to clients that Reddit is already generating over $100 million a year in fees from OpenAI and Google's Gemini, and the sum could double with Anthropic and Perplexity fees, TheFly.com reported.

Reddit settled litigation against Anthropic and Perplexity over use of Reddit content without a licensing agreement.

""As overall referral traffic shrinks, the platforms that AI answers cite (like Reddit) become increasingly valuable, we believe,"" the analyst said. Studies show Reddit is a ""key beneficiary"" of citations within answers generated through Google's AI overviews and ChatGPT, she added.

Earlier in December, Needham named Reddit its 2026 Top Pick and added the stock to the firm's conviction list. Piper Sandler and Jefferies also have named Reddit a top pick for 2026.

Reddit has a Composite Rating of 94 and ATR of 4.42.

Globus Medical Recovers From Decline

Globus Medical is forming a large cup-with-handle base with a 240.18 buy point, holding the 21-day line on Friday. The stock fell a steep 45% while forming the base, so the current five-week-old handle provides a pause that should help the stock break out successfully. Investors could use resistance around 90 as an early entry.

The stock recouped most of its decline on Nov. 7, when shares gapped up 36% on the company's blowout third-quarter report. Sales and earnings exceeded all analyst estimates, and Globus raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance.

Audubon, Penn.-based Globus makes products and surgical tools for joint reconstruction, spine conditions and other musculoskeletal ailments.

The company said growth in U.S. spine procedures drove much of its Q3 performance, and that momentum carried into Q4. Acquisitions also helped drive results.

Stocks To Watch: Globus Trends

In December, RBC Capital raised the price target on Globus Medical to 100 from 92 and kept an outperform rating. Analysts believe aging demographics, growing global health care access and differentiated innovation are driving momentum in the industry, TheFly.com reported. Globus is poised to deliver a solid year of sales growth.

At the same time, Canaccord raised the price target to 105 from 90 and kept a buy rating, citing bullish views for the medical technology sector in 2026 amid depressed valuations and growing deal activity, TheFly.com said. AI is changing the space, enabling improved patient treatments and surgical accuracy.

Globus Medical has a Composite Rating of 98, one of the highest in the medical products industry group. It has an ATR of 2.05% and is a stock to watch.

ID6,Barclays,2026-01-04 00:33:04+00:00,New York Post,"The Michael Porter Jr. challenge that Sean Marks, Nets face is a complicated one",Brian Lewis,,,,,https://nypost.com/2026/01/03/sports/michael-porter-jr-challenge-that-nets-face-is-a-complicated-one/,"Whether or not ailing Michael Porter Jr. is back Sunday to face the Nuggets team that traded him away, his absence has only underscored his importance.
With Porter, the Nets have been competitive — and at times, slightly better than that, winning seven of his past 10.
Now they’ll host the Nuggets at Barclays Center having dropped three straight and watched their tank get back on track.
That’s what they did with Porter, prying the Nuggets’ coveted unprotected 2032 first-rounder just to take Porter.
“Yeah, I love it here,” Porter said when asked by The Post if he sees himself in Brooklyn long term.","Whether or not ailing Michael Porter Jr. is back Sunday to face the Nuggets team that traded him away, his absence has only underscored his importance.

With Porter, the Nets have been competitive — and at times, slightly better than that, winning seven of his past 10. But without him, they’re 0-6.

Now they’ll host the Nuggets at Barclays Center having dropped three straight and watched their tank get back on track.

And despite Porter’s recent illness — he’s listed as probable after missing the prior two games — an increasing number of teams now are being connected to possible interest in the red-hot forward.

Porter is averaging a career-high 25.8 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists. He’s the only qualified player in the East mustering at least 25 points and seven boards and one of just five in the whole league, joining Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, Lauri Markkanen and Deni Avdija.

At 27 on a rebuilding team, that makes Porter a walking inflection point.

A starter on Denver’s 2023 champs, is Porter more valuable as a foundation piece to build around, despite whatever spots his scoring costs the Nets in the lottery standings? Or is he more valuable as a trade chip before next month’s deadline, bringing back picks — and helping the Nets’ own selection by his departure?

These aren’t the only decisions general manager Sean Marks has to make, but they are among the most important — and the most pressing.

The Post reported in the summer that the Nets expect to have a two-year tank and step up in Year 3. Now, Jake Fischer of The Steinline wrote the Nets’ time frame could hinge on how they fare in the June draft, and that league sources expect them to start being aggressive following the draft, regardless of whether or not they trade Porter.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NBA STANDINGS AND NETS STATS

After being boxed into a corner by James Harden broadsiding them — and probably even before that — Marks values flexibility. He’s created just that, with the Nets leading the league in not only draft picks (32 total, 13 firsts — a dozen unprotected) but cap space ($15.5 million, up to $50 million this offseason).

They can use the latter to get more of the former, taking salary dumps before the trade deadline to land more picks. That’s what they did with Porter, prying the Nuggets’ coveted unprotected 2032 first-rounder just to take Porter.

Being salary-dumped is something Porter used as fuel en route to his career year.

“Yeah, I definitely use everything I can as motivation,” Porter said. “It was just so much noise about me as a player. I just felt like a lot of stuff was discredited because of the fact that it was a rough ending to my time there.

“I knew if I was healthy coming here, I’d be able to change the narrative around me.”

Porter has changed not just the narrative but his value.

After the trade was derided as one of the worst of the decade by Bill Simmons, now Fischer notes that a first-rounder and re-tradable salary may not be enough to get the Nets to flip Porter midseason.

The Clippers and Bucks have been linked with interest in Porter. Fischer reported that Milwaukee is evaluating Porter and adds the Warriors and Bulls, as well.

But the Nets have moved from sixth to fifth in the lottery standings, seeing their odds at one of the three elite prospects — Darryn Peterson, Cam Boozer or AJ Dybantsa — go up from 27.6 percent to 31.6 percent. They’re only 1 ½ games out of fourth, which would see that jump to 36.6 percent.

While moving Porter would aid their tank, the past few games have shown that spotting him rest days can do the same. And he clearly likes Brooklyn.

“Yeah, I love it here,” Porter said when asked by The Post if he sees himself in Brooklyn long term. “So whatever team wants and appreciates what I bring to the table, then that’s where I want to be. And I feel like they do here. … Like I said, if they want me here, I’d love to be here.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-u1hzhvso3-1767483623193.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1767465638&w=1200,N,,2026-01-03 20:59:30.643725

Zu verdanken sind die grünen vor allem zwei Neuigkeiten. An Silvester wurde bekannt, dass in China der Patentschutz für Semaglutid, der Wirkstoff von Wegovy und Ozempic, bestätigt wurde. Generikahersteller, die bereits mit den Hufen scharren, werden sich deshalb noch etwas zurückhalten müssen.

In den USA gab es kurz zuvor eine Zulassung für eine oral zu verabreichende Variante von Wegovy, also eine Abnehmpille. Jene soll noch im Januar auf dem Markt platziert werden und für frische Umsätze sorgen. Von einem großen Turnaround wird an der Börse zwar noch nicht geträumt. Doch die Börsianer gehen etwas leichtfüßiger ins neue Jahr.

Novo Nordisk kämpft mit der Konkurrenz

Dauerhaft leichter wird es für Novo Nordisk nicht unbedingt werden. In China mag man die Generikahersteller noch ein Weilchen länger auf Abstand halten. Ewig können die Dänen sich auf ihren Patenten aber nicht ausruhen. Gleichzeitig erhöht sich der Konkurrenzdruck im Westen kontinuierlich.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Novo Nordisk?

Novo Nordisk Aktie Chart

Eli Lilly strebt bereits im Frühjahr eine Zulassung für eine eigene Abnehmpille an und zahlreiche weitere Pharmariesen entwickeln eifrig eigene Medikamente, um sich ein Stück des Kuchens zu sichern. Entscheidend wird für die Zukunft vor allem sein, ob Novo Nordisk mit neuen Projekten aus der Pipeline gegenüber der Konkurrenz bestehen kann.

Ungewisse Aussichten

Das Jahr 2026 dürfte im Markt der Abnehmmedikamente noch für einige Überraschungen sorgen, die für Novo Nordisk voraussichtlich nicht immer angenehmer Natur sein werden. Das ist den Anlegern bewusst, weshalb die Reaktion auf die guten Neuigkeiten sich einigermaßen in Grenzen hält. Etwas verbessert hat die Ausgangslage sich für den dänischen Konzern. Doch unter dem Strich bleibt noch immer viel Unsicherheit im weiteren Ausblick.

So, while Taiwan Semiconductor remains dominant, its capacity issues create openings for its competitors to gain traction and, in Intel’s case, validate its turnaround strategy.

Tech giants have invested heavily in data centers and specialized hardware to meet surging demand for training and inference tasks. However, constraints are emerging that cap this growth rate.

Supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in advanced manufacturing, limit how quickly new AI capabilities can scale. Power availability and component shortages further hinder expansion. It could be that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is one of the key linchpins determining how far and fast AI expands.

Google’s TPU Cut Reveals Packaging Crunch

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) has reportedly reduced its 2026 production target for Tensor Processing Units from around 4 million to 3 million units. According to a report by Korea Economic Daily, this adjustment stems from limited access to Taiwan Semiconductor’s CoWoS advanced packaging capacity, which Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) secured through priority allocations. CoWoS integrates processors with high-bandwidth memory on a silicon interposer, essential for high-performance AI accelerators. Without sufficient capacity, finished chips cannot deploy at scale. Other outlets have reported on production caps previously.

Taiwan Semiconductor dominates CoWoS technology, but explosive AI demand has outpaced its expansions. Nvidia has locked in over half of its available capacity through 2026 and 2027, leaving competitors like Google constrained. This forced Google to cut its production target despite strong internal needs for its custom silicon.

The issue underscores how supply allocation now influences the AI hardware landscape more than design or demand alone.

Battle for the Production Line Shapes AI’s Future

Chipmakers and designers are competing intensely for positions in Taiwan Semiconductor’s production queue. Google’s experience highlights this scramble, where securing advanced packaging determines output volumes. Nvidia’s dominance in allocations gives it an edge in scaling AI accelerators, while others face delays.

This dynamic parallels energy constraints limiting data center buildouts. Power grids struggle to support massive, expanding AI infrastructure, capping expansion opportunities. Yet Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing controls the core components inside those centers, from logic dies to packaged accelerators. Its role as the primary foundry for leading-edge nodes makes it central to AI progress. Without its capacity ramps, even abundant energy would not translate to deployable hardware.

Taiwan Semiconductor is accelerating capacity expansion through 2028, doubling its advanced wafer capabilities. It is also repurposing 200 mm fabs for advanced packaging, which could increase its returns. If fully utilized, it would not be surprising to see revenue double by 2028.

Potential Lift for Intel’s Foundry Ambitions

Yet the CoWoS shortage could end up boosting the competition, which moves in to fill the void created. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), for example, is aiming to rival Taiwan Semiconductor in foundry services. Google has explored alternatives like Intel’s EMIB packaging for future TPUs, such as the v9 accelerator expected around 2027. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also is said to have placed orders with Intel, while Apple could tap Intel’s 18A process for its entry-level M-series chips starting in 2027.

The foundry’s focus on custom ASICs and advanced packaging puts it in step with industry needs for efficient AI compute. Its 18A and 14A nodes, plus EMIB, position it to capture business from hyperscalers seeking alternatives. Intel is scaling its New Mexico facility’s capacity by 30% for EMIB and 150% for Foveros, its own advanced 3D packaging technology.

Yet Nvidia reportedly reviewed and passed on using Intel’s facilities, though both Google and Apple are reportedly also sounding out Samsung‘s two facilities in Texas to meet their needs. Samsung is offering advanced packaging as a “turnkey” solution bundled with DRAM and foundry services to hyperscalers such as Google, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

So, while Taiwan Semiconductor remains dominant, its capacity issues create openings for its competitors to gain traction and, in Intel’s case, validate its turnaround strategy.

Key Takeaway

While Nvidia seems to have the inside track on commanding priority, boosting its long-term dominance in the space, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is increasingly the key to whether other chipmakers and designers thrive. As advanced packaging becomes the new industry bottleneck, its CoWoS capacity can determine who scales compute.

This kingmaker capability — Taiwan Semiconductor deciding where the players stand in line — can ultimately decide the AI market’s winners and losers.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GOOG-Ironwood-TPU-400x226.png,N,,2026-01-03 19:00:58.018338

Delta Air Lines has AC power outlets at most seats. But that doesn’t mean all your devices should be powered. A short video shows a woman seated in Comfort+ extra legroom economyusing a curling iron to curl her hair inflight.

Commenters seem to argue that “curling irons are banned” but usually mix up whose rules apply. TSA doesn’t restrict plug-in curling irons. They’re allowed in carry-on and checked bags.

Cordless curling irons may be restricted – such as if they contain lithium batteries or (apparently this is a thing, I had no idea) if they’re gas or butane fueled. Those are going to be limited to carry-on bags (but they’re still allowed through the checkpoint).

None of that means you can use a heating appliance on board. Just because you can bring it on doesn’t mean you’re permitted to use it. Or that it’s a reasonable idea to primp and preen with a hot curling iron, going section by section through your hair throughout the flight.

Delta’s rules do not specifically mention curling irons. They allow hair dryers and straighteners when packed properly but I don’t know that anyone actually envisioned whipping this tool out and using it onboard. Their Contract of Carriage, though, does say they can refuse to transport and remove passengers who fail to obey crewmember instructions or if their behavior is hazardous, creating a risk of harm or unreasonably annoying others. So it’s really crew discretion.

Of course, we’ve seen passengers whip out a full-sized iMac to work in coach, plug in a power strip at their seat to charge multiple devices at once, and my personal favorite, bring out a sewing machine to spend the flight making curtains.

The UK’s manufacturing sector grew at the fastest pace in 15 months in December, as the impact of uncertainty about the autumn Budget and the Jaguar Land Rover cyber attack began to fade, a new survey shows.

The S&P Global UK manufacturing PMI survey, watched closely by economists, showed a reading of 50.6 in December, up from 50.2 in November.

Any reading above 50.0 indicates that activity is growing while any score below means it is contracting.

Manufacturing output increased for the third month in a row and the level of new orders for firms rose for the first time since September 2024, according to the survey.

Some businesses benefited from conditions improving at the turn of the year having come under pressure from challenges in parts of the market.

This includes those across the supply chain affected by production shutdowns at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after the British carmaker was impacted by a major cyber attack at the end of August.

The incident was linked to a drop in overall motor manufacturing during September.

Sentiment also showed signs of improving since the autumn Budget at the end of November, which provided some certainty over tax and policy measures impacting the UK’s industrial sectors.

Demand within the UK was the main driver of growth in new orders for manufacturers last month, with intakes of new work from overseas contracting for nearly four years.

However, the rate of decline in new export businesses was mild, with UK firms pointing to signs of recovery in demand from the US, the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions last month.

Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: “The domestic market remained a positive spur to growth, while new export business, despite having now fallen for almost four consecutive years, took a sizeable stride towards stabilising.

“UK manufacturers benefited from several reduced headwinds towards the end of the year, as the negative impacts of the uncertainty surrounding the autumn Budget, tariffs and the JLR cyber attack all moderated.

“The start of 2026 will show if growth can be sustained after these temporary boosts subside.”

Mr Dobson said the drivers of growth need to “shift more towards rising demand” and away from firms clearing backlogs of work.

Employment within the sector also fell for the 14th month in a row, but at the slowest rate since the period of job shedding began.

Chris Barlow, head of manufacturing at accountancy and advisory firm MHA, said its clients are expecting hiring to continue to slow in 2026 and are “instead looking to find ways to work more efficiently, often by automating or improving their processes”.

He added: “Government measures, such as the confirmed increase to the minimum wage, alongside the impact of the salary sacrifice cap, are making businesses cautious about hiring new staff.”

He also said improving demand in the UK would be “vital for manufacturing’s prospects in 2026 given the path ahead for global trade is not expected to get any easier”.",http://nation.cymru/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/01JK5KC3HQQ63DK4ADPT4Z9H7Y.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 03:58:55.365777

On December 24, the chip giant announced a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Groq, an AI inference chip company founded by former Google TPU engineers, covering its inference technology. The deal is reportedly valued at $20 billion, with Groq expected to generate $1.4 billion in revenue in 2026.

But the deal involves more than just the tech. As part of the transaction, Groq founder Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and additional team members will join Nvidia to support the advancement and scaling of the licensed tech. Ross, who will serve as Nvidia’s Chief Software Architect, previously helped build and scale Google’s TPU before co-founding Groq with other Google engineers in 2016. Groq will remain an independent company, and its GroqCloud developer platform, which provides API access to Groq’s LPUs, will keep on operating without interruption.

Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter sees the move as potentially transformative. In his view, Nvidia isn’t just adding another tool to its arsenal – it’s opening the door to a different way of thinking about AI computing altogether.

“With the deal,” says the analyst, “NVIDIA is embracing a fundamentally different processing architecture that we believe will eventually be integrated into its roadmap.”

Groq’s architecture differs fundamentally from GPUs. Its LPU (language processing unit) processors use deterministic spatial dataflow, executing operations in a fixed sequence. As a “classic example,” Buchalter compares the two architectures to factories: an LPU is like a high-speed, purpose-built assembly line, while a GPU resembles a busy factory where a manager gives tasks to workers.

An LPU is designed to make AI inference faster, more consistent, and more energy-efficient. To do this, it relies on a smart compiler that carefully plans exactly when and where each calculation happens and how data flows through the chip. In simple terms, the chip itself stays simple, while the software does all the hard work.

Groq’s LPUs are built specifically for AI inference, with Buchalter believing they are not aimed at the training market. The analyst thinks that Nvidia’s adoption of an inference-focused chip – and a new architecture – highlights how “large and mature” low-latency inference has become. Previously, AI infrastructure investments tended to prioritize training, under the logic that training chips would later serve for inference.

“This is unsurprising as the industry has indicated an increasing portion of revenue coming from inference,” Buchalter further said, “but NVIDIA’s licensing deal with Groq likely signals the inference market has scaled to the point where inference-only procurement is an increasingly material portion of the market.”

To this end, Buchalter sticks with a Buy rating on NVDA shares, assigning a $235 price target that implies ~24% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here)

Meanwhile, the broader analyst community is even more optimistic. The Street’s average price target of $262.79 suggests 39% upside, and with 39 Buys against just one Hold and one Sell, Nvidia carries a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See NVDA stock analysis)

Should you buy the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing?","Creating an efficient and versatile smart home setup is a worthwhile endeavor, especially for those who work, workout, stream, game, and play at home. With so many services, gadgets, and smart devices, it can be tricky to make sure everything fits together seamlessly and easily.

I was taken aback when I first set up the LG Smart Monitor Swing, a device that looks to have a lot of functionality and versatility, in part because it's not static. The monitor swing is built on wheels and designed, it seems, for those who do a lot of different things online at home. Someone like me. I tested out this exciting gadget for a few weeks, and here's what I discovered.

Price, availability, and specs

This compelling product comprises a 4K touchscreen monitor and an adjustable rolling stand. The 31.5-inch monitor features UHD resolution, HDR10, and a 60Hz refresh rate. The monitor includes three HDMI ports and two USB ports; one of each cable is included with the unit.

The stand features wheels so that you can roll around the unit, and the arm allows for adjustments to height. You can also tilt and swivel the monitor, and rotate it from landscape to portrait orientation.

Some assembly is required; the pieces are a bit heavy and cumbersome, but a single person can put them together on their own in a relatively short amount of time.

The monitor swing stand is available from LG, Amazon, and Best Buy. It retails for $1,300, but has been found on sale for up to $500 off.

What I like about the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing

Highly versatile for work, play, and everything in between

There's a lot that this clever device does fairly well, and overall it makes for a helpful tool for someone who does a lot of different things with a screen at home. Notably, this monitor features LG's webOS, which grants you easy access to entertainment, gaming, lifestyle, and productivity apps.

Due to its size, it works well as a screen for streaming titles for an audience or one or maybe two, while also making it more than suitable as a large space for work. The HDMI and USB ports are quite handy; I used the monitor as an extension of my laptop, adding efficiency to my work day. While it can do a lot, the creation of a bigger workspace is probably the biggest draw for me as someone who works at home and does a lot of writing and connects remotely with others.

One of the main appeals of the stand is its ability to move and adjust with ease based on your needs. The wheels move fairly easily, jsut make sure you don't have anything blocking the path, because the unit in all is quite heavy. The height can be adjusted within reason, while the monitor can tilt and swivel as well. Perhaps the most fun is that the screen can be rotated from a landscape orientation to a portrait one, which can be useful in a lot of circumstances, including when casting from your phone.

A remote is included, and it resembles current smart TV models; it's durable, small, and laid out with efficiency. It includes buttons to jump to apps as well as different inputs. I found I wasn't using the touchscreen element as much as I initially thought; it's helpful in certain cases when working or sharing media, and I'm certainly happy it exists, I just didn't use it a ton.

The design is fairly clever too; the white aesthetic is neutral and accommodating, while the base features a removable lid that cleverly houses and consoles the power adapter.

What I didn't like about the LG 4K Smart Monitor Swing

Screen quality and features don't serve faithful entertainment

While the Smart Monitor Swing can do a lot of different things for you throughout your day quite well, it's not really superb at most of those things. It casts a wide net of uses but is more a generalist than a specialist. Its 60Hz refresh rate and HDR10 compatibility, for example, mean it's not going to give you the action blockbuster or cinematic movie experience you'll get with a high-end TV. The monitor is not a TV screen either; the image is worthy, with quality color, but sharpness, brightness, and contrast are not going to be up to the standards of even a mid-range smart TV.

There is no battery for the monitor swing. You must keep the power adapter plugged in at all times while using, so be mindful when moving and setting up the stand.

You can connect your gaming console or enjoy cloud gaming within webOS. However, it's not ideal for serious online gamers. The refresh rate, along with a 5ms response rate, mean you're not set up with ideal circumstances for competitive online play. Ports offer HDMI 2.0 connections, but not HDMI 2.1, so you won't be getting the most out of either top gen console.

Lastly, glare is common on the screen, so you'll need to be mindful of ambient lighting and what you're watching.

There's certainly a lot of value to be had here provided you both appreciate the many possibilities of the monitor swing and accept its limitations. It will likely serve you best as a unique companion for work and creative endeavors, with appeal coming from its size, adjustment ability, and connectivity options. It can also supplement more casual entertainment consumption, playing games and watching titles where fidelity and visual components aren't as important.

I found a lot of uses. I enjoyed a much bigger monitor for my work space, a secondary screen that has sports on in the background, and a sizable space to share photos and videos from my phone. I rolled it into the kitchen to watch holiday movies while baking, and used it as a large personal tablet to do some shopping.

The pharmaceutical giant’s stock is trading at record levels, buoyed at the start of the year by a fresh upgrade from analysts. However, this optimism is not solely based on past performance. Aggressive price reductions in China and promising clinical trial data suggest the firm is aiming to solidify its leadership in the weight-loss medication market.

A key driver of recent news flow is the company's operational strategy. Just before the turn of the year, Eli Lilly confirmed it had cut prices for its blockbuster drug Mounjaro in China. Market observers interpret this as an aggressive play to capture market share in the world's second-largest economy.

The objective appears clear: by prioritizing volume over margin, Eli Lilly aims to pressure rival Novo Nordisk and its product Wegovy. This tactic is designed to deeply embed Lilly’s GLP-1 therapies in the Asian market, even if it temporarily weighs on profitability.

A Vote of Confidence from the Analyst Community

Institutional confidence in the company's sustained growth trajectory was underscored on Saturday, January 3, 2026, when Zacks Research upgraded Eli Lilly shares to a ""Strong-Buy"" rating. The stock had closed the previous Friday at $1,080.36, marking a new 52-week high.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Eli Lilly?

This upgrade comes during a period where Eli Lilly has already demonstrated impressive performance. With a gain of over 42% on a 12-month basis, the company has outpaced many competitors in the healthcare sector. The long-term bullish sentiment is further confirmed by institutional investors like CMH Wealth Management, which recently expanded its holdings.

Pipeline Holds Promise with Oral Candidate

Another critical factor for future prospects lies in the company's clinical pipeline. Recent Phase 3 trial data for the drug candidate Orforglipron, from the ""ATTAIN-MAINTAIN"" study, have shown promising results. This compound represents an oral alternative to the injectable treatments currently standard.

Developing an effective pill is considered a major goal in the weight-loss market, as it would appeal to patients averse to injections. Should Eli Lilly secure regulatory approval for an oral therapy ahead of its competitors, the total addressable market could expand significantly.

Looking Ahead

Investor focus now shifts to the quarterly earnings report expected in early February. A key consideration will be the extent to which international price reductions impact margins and whether the robust revenue growth—approximately 54% in the third quarter of 2025—can be sustained. From a technical perspective, the new ""Strong-Buy"" rating could provide the necessary catalyst for the shares to test the $1,100 level in the coming trading week.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2422033_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 12:13:22.612180

Eli Lilly & Co. is no longer just a blue-chip pharma name buried in retirement portfolios. Over the past few years, ""Eli Lilly & Co."" has effectively become a flagship product in its own right: a tightly integrated platform of obesity, diabetes, neuroscience, and oncology therapies that’s rewriting the rules for what a modern pharmaceutical powerhouse looks like.

The hype around Eli Lilly & Co. is anchored in a very real problem: global metabolic disease. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are ballooning into trillion-dollar public health crises, overwhelming healthcare systems and shortening lives worldwide. The company’s GLP-1–based treatments, led by its blockbuster obesity and diabetes franchise, have moved from niche therapeutics to cultural touchstones cited in earnings calls, political debates, and even celebrity interviews.

That shift has turned Eli Lilly & Co. from a conventional drug maker into a category-defining product ecosystem. Its medicines aren’t just therapies; they are becoming infrastructure for how health systems, insurers, and patients think about weight management, cardiovascular risk, and chronic disease prevention.

Get all details on Eli Lilly & Co. here

Inside the Flagship: Eli Lilly & Co.

When investors, clinicians, and regulators talk about Eli Lilly & Co. today, they’re really talking about a product portfolio anchored in one dominant theme: using metabolic and biologic innovation to rewrite the standard of care. The company’s core offering is no longer a single molecule but an integrated platform spanning obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and chronic disease management.

At the center of this is Lilly’s GLP-1 and incretin-based franchise for obesity and type 2 diabetes, which has rapidly become the company’s spiritual equivalent of a ""flagship device"" in the pharma world. These drugs, which modulate hormones involved in appetite, insulin secretion, and energy balance, have delivered startling levels of weight loss and metabolic improvement in clinical trials and real-world use.

What makes Eli Lilly & Co. so product-centric now is how this flagship franchise connects to a broader pipeline:

Metabolic disease platform: The company is evolving beyond one-off obesity drugs into a recurring, combination-based model. Newer molecules and next-generation incretins are designed to improve efficacy, boost tolerability, and expand treatment to earlier stages of metabolic dysfunction. This resembles a tech roadmap more than a traditional one-and-done pharma launch.

Cardiometabolic outcomes: Lilly is running large outcomes trials to show hard benefits beyond weight loss — including reduced cardiovascular events, improved kidney outcomes, and long-term risk reduction. If these data continue to hit, Lilly’s products don’t just compete with rival drugs; they cannibalize entire procedural categories like bariatric surgery and some interventional cardiology.

Neuroscience and Alzheimer’s disease: In parallel, Eli Lilly & Co. is building a second, high-risk, high-upside product pillar in neuroscience, with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease. Disease-modifying treatments targeting amyloid and related pathways could rapidly become some of the world’s most valuable drugs if efficacy and safety profiles hold.

Oncology and immunology: While less in the spotlight than obesity, Lilly’s oncology and immunology assets form a critical diversification layer. These products give the company resilience if any single category faces regulatory pushback, reimbursement tension, or safety controversies.

Strategically, Eli Lilly & Co. behaves increasingly like a platform technology company. It invests heavily in:

Data and real-world evidence: Using outcome data, claims, and long-term follow-up to strengthen its value proposition with payers and governments.

Manufacturing scale as a feature: Capacity has become a product differentiator. Lilly is spending billions to expand injection and drug-substance manufacturing so it can meet surging demand and avoid the shortages plaguing the GLP-1 category.

Patient and provider experience: Through support programs, digital tools, and co-pay assistance, Lilly is making its therapies feel more like an end-to-end product experience than a simple prescription.

In other words, Eli Lilly & Co. is less a static portfolio of molecules and more a constantly iterated suite of health technology products, updated with fresh clinical data and production scaling the same way a cloud platform adds features and regions.

Market Rivals: Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie vs. The Competition

Eli Lilly & Co. doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Its most intense rival in the current cycle is Novo Nordisk, while longtime diversified peers like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson compete from different strategic angles. A few products define the battlefield.

Novo Nordisk and the GLP-1 showdown

Compared directly to Nova Nordisk’s Wegovy (semaglutide for obesity) and Ozempic (semaglutide for type 2 diabetes), Eli Lilly & Co.’s metabolic platform is the benchmark that investors and clinicians constantly measure against.

Efficacy: Trial data across the GLP-1/incretin class show high levels of weight loss for both Wegovy/Ozempic and Lilly’s obesity/diabetes therapies. However, Lilly’s next-generation incretin combinations have been positioned to offer more robust weight loss and metabolic control in certain patient groups. This has turned clinical comparisons into a quasi-spec war, with each new dataset treated like a product launch event.

Dosing and adherence: Both companies offer injectable formulations, often once-weekly. The race is on to deliver more convenient dosing schedules, better tolerability, and easier patient onboarding. Novo Nordisk has made early moves on oral semaglutide, while Lilly is exploring formats aimed at improving real-world adherence.

Supply chain: Wegovy and Ozempic have faced repeated supply constraints as demand exploded. Eli Lilly & Co. has faced its own bottlenecks but is investing heavily in additional manufacturing capacity. In this market, the company that can simply keep pharmacies stocked often wins prescriptions — and mindshare.

Pfizer: a rival searching for a metabolic foothold

Compared directly to Pfizer’s developmental obesity and diabetes programs, Eli Lilly & Co. looks more like a mature, fully shipped product than a roadmap. Pfizer has pursued oral obesity drug candidates and GLP-1–adjacent mechanisms, but has struggled with setbacks, safety questions, and trial discontinuations.

Time-to-market: Pfizer is years behind the Lilly–Novo duopoly in regulatory approvals and commercial infrastructure for obesity therapeutics. That delay gives Eli Lilly & Co. crucial first-mover advantages with prescribers and payers.

Brand and outcomes data: While Pfizer is a trusted name in vaccines and cardiovascular drugs, it lacks a flagship obesity product in mass clinical use. Eli Lilly & Co. is already building a dense network of real-world data and outcomes evidence that will be difficult to dislodge.

Johnson & Johnson and the diversified defense

Compared directly to Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen portfolio, Eli Lilly & Co. stands out as more concentrated on high-growth metabolic and neuroscience categories. J&J remains a diversified healthcare conglomerate with strength in medical devices and oncology, but it lacks a comparable GLP-1–driven obesity franchise.

Risk vs. resilience: Johnson & Johnson offers stability through diversification, while Eli Lilly & Co. concentrates risk and upside in a few massive therapeutic categories. For patients and payers, Lilly’s focus means sharper innovation; for investors, it means higher volatility and higher potential returns.

Across this rivalry landscape, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie has become shorthand for owning a leading slice of the obesity and diabetes revolution — analogous to holding a dominant cloud provider in the early days of enterprise SaaS.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

So why does Eli Lilly & Co. currently outmuscle its rivals in perception, prescription, and valuation? Several structural advantages stand out.

1. A category-creating flagship

In tech terms, Lilly’s GLP-1/incretin franchise is its ""iPhone moment"" — a single family of products that redefines the category and then spawns an ecosystem around it. Instead of endlessly following patent cliffs with me-too drugs, Eli Lilly & Co. has created a highly differentiated platform that:

Delivers transformative weight loss for many patients, not just incremental change.

Targets multiple endpoints (weight, glucose, cardiovascular risk) with a single therapeutic strategy.

Anchors an expanding line of follow-on products and life-cycle extensions.

2. Execution at industrial scale

In modern pharma, manufacturing and supply reliability are as much a feature as efficacy. Eli Lilly & Co. is aggressively expanding its production footprint, pouring billions into new facilities and contract manufacturing. That industrial build-out is a competitive moat: it’s hard for latecomers to match both the clinical performance and the physical supply chain.

3. Data as a force multiplier

Lilly’s strategy leans heavily into real-world evidence and long-term outcomes trials. This data-rich approach does two things:

Strengthens the company’s hand in negotiations with insurers and national health systems, which increasingly want proof that weight loss translates into fewer hospitalizations and events.

Builds brand durability with clinicians, who grow more confident prescribing therapies backed by large, longitudinal datasets.

4. Focused but diversified pipeline

While obesity and diabetes dominate headlines, Eli Lilly & Co. has built credible second pillars in neuroscience and oncology. That gives the company:

Hedge potential if pricing pressure or political scrutiny hits obesity drugs.

Optionality to create new flagship products — especially in areas like Alzheimer’s disease, where even modest efficacy can have enormous commercial and societal impact.

5. Strong pricing power and payer appeal

Unlike many older drugs trapped in a race-to-the-bottom generic pricing cycle, Lilly’s newest products sit at the premium end of the spectrum. But because they can reduce downstream costs (fewer complications, fewer procedures), insurers are increasingly willing to pay. That combination of premium pricing and cost-offset justification is a recipe for robust, sustained margins.

In sum, Eli Lilly & Co. wins right now because it behaves less like a slow-moving incumbent and more like a high-growth product company, constantly iterating and scaling around one core thesis: that metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases can be meaningfully re-architected with modern biology.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The transformation of Eli Lilly & Co. into a product-centric growth engine has been vividly reflected in Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie (ISIN: US5324571083).

According to real-time market data from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch accessed shortly before publication, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie was trading at approximately USD 775–785 per share, with a market capitalization well above USD 700 billion. Both sources indicated that the stock has delivered strong double-digit percentage gains over the past 12 months, significantly outperforming major indices like the S&P 500 and most pharmaceutical peers. The pricing and performance data referenced were based on the latest available intraday quotes and, where applicable, the last official closing price.

This valuation is not being driven by legacy products; it is a direct vote of confidence in Eli Lilly & Co. as a high-growth product platform anchored in its obesity and diabetes franchise. Several dynamics are in play:

Revenue growth from GLP-1 and incretin-based products: Sales of Lilly’s metabolic therapies have become the primary growth engine, with analysts attributing a majority of recent top-line expansion to this category. Multi-year demand projections remain aggressive as obesity treatment shifts from niche to mainstream.

Pipeline-fueled optionality: Investors are assigning substantial value to pipeline assets in Alzheimer’s disease, oncology, and next-generation metabolic drugs. Each positive trial readout or regulatory milestone is treated like a major product launch, adding layers of optionality on top of already-strong sales.

Multiple expansion vs. peers: Eli Lilly & Co. trades at a premium earnings multiple compared to more diversified peers such as Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer. Markets are effectively rating Lilly less like a mature pharma and more like a growth technology company with recurring revenue characteristics driven by chronic therapies.

Risk factors priced in, but not dominant: Concerns about political scrutiny over pricing, reimbursement caps, and long-term safety monitoring for obesity drugs are real. However, the current valuation suggests investors believe the structural demand and health-economic benefits of these therapies will outweigh policy friction.

For now, Eli Lilly & Co. Aktie functions as a pure-play expression of the market’s belief in the future of obesity and diabetes treatment. If the company continues to execute — by scaling supply, securing broad reimbursement, and delivering convincing outcomes data — the stock remains closely tied to the performance of its flagship product ecosystem.

Ultimately, Eli Lilly & Co. has turned a 19th-century drugmaker brand into a 21st-century health technology product story. The company’s therapies are no longer just prescriptions written in a doctor’s office; they’re strategic assets reshaping healthcare budgets, clinical guidelines, and, increasingly, the way global markets think about long-term growth.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404986_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 17:59:57.955058

In 2026, as AI moves from technological exploration to scaled deployment, Microsoft’s ecosystem advantages are expected to amplify further.","According to the 13F filing submitted by his hedge fund, Thiel Macro, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Silicon Valley legendary investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel executed a notable portfolio adjustment in the third quarter of 2025. As of September 30, Thiel had completely exited his position in Nvidia and significantly reduced his Tesla holdings from over 272,000 shares to just 65,000 shares.

Known for his forward-looking insights into technology trends as the first outside investor in Facebook, Thiel did not redirect the proceeds from these sales into non-tech sectors like industrials or healthcare. Instead, he made substantial purchases of Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), initiating a position of nearly 50,000 shares in Microsoft and increasing his stake in Apple. This contrarian move reflects his unique perspective on the evolving landscape of the AI industry.

Thiel’s third-quarter adjustments garnered significant attention on Wall Street. His decision to fully exit Nvidia appeared particularly bold against the backdrop of a global AI frenzy, with Nvidia’s stock price continuing to climb as a core provider of computing power. Data shows that Thiel held over 537,000 shares of Nvidia at the end of Q2, but by the end of Q3, he held none. Simultaneously, he reduced his Tesla position by more than 76%. These moves sent a clear signal: Thiel likely believes these high-flying leaders may have already priced in near-term expectations.

It is worth noting that Thiel’s investment in Microsoft has been volatile. He held no Microsoft shares in Q4 2024, built a position of nearly 80,000 shares in Q1 2025, sold all of them in Q2, and then bought nearly 50,000 shares again in Q3. This back-and-forth confirms his ongoing re-evaluation of Microsoft’s value. As of early January 2026, Microsoft’s stock price had declined about 6% since September 30 and was down roughly 2% from June 30. If Thiel remains bullish on Microsoft’s prospects, the current price may represent a more attractive buying opportunity than when he initially purchased.

The core reason Thiel chose Microsoft over continuing to bet on Nvidia lies in their different positions within the AI industry chain. Nvidia is the “shovel seller” of AI hardware and computing power, while Microsoft is transforming into the “builder” and “enabler” of the AI ecosystem. Microsoft’s unique advantage is its “neutral platform” positioning. Unlike companies developing large language models entirely in-house, Microsoft chose to strategically invest, acquiring approximately a 27% stake in OpenAI, and deeply integrated its ChatGPT into the Copilot product, spanning the entire Office suite, Bing search engine, Windows operating system, and other software.

More importantly, in its cloud business, Azure, Microsoft has adopted an open strategy. Enterprise customers can choose from various large models like Anthropic’s Claude, xAI’s Grok, China’s DeepSeek R1, and Meta’s Llama for application development. This “non-aligned” ecosystem strategy allows Microsoft to avoid technology roadmap risks and positions it as a core beneficiary of the AI software trend.

This strategy is already showing early results. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, ended September 30, 2025, Azure revenue grew by a staggering 40% year-over-year, becoming Microsoft’s fastest-growing business segment. The strong performance of the cloud business validates the core value of Microsoft as an AI infrastructure platform.

Looking ahead to 2026, Microsoft’s opportunities in the AI field will revolve around three key dimensions. First is the continued expansion of Azure. As global enterprises accelerate AI deployment, demand for flexible, scalable cloud platforms is surging. Microsoft’s multi-model support strategy allows it to meet the diverse needs of different enterprises regarding cost, performance, and regional compliance, simultaneously enhancing customer stickiness and platform value.

Second is the accelerated monetization of AI products. AI assistants like Copilot are transitioning from value-added features to core productivity tools. As user habits form and features iterate, subscription revenue from AI add-on services will become a new growth engine. Microsoft, with its dominant position in the enterprise software market, possesses the most direct path to commercialization.

Finally, there is the network effect of the ecosystem. Through platforms like Azure and GitHub, Microsoft connects developers, enterprise customers, and AI model providers, building an increasingly robust AI ecosystem. This ecosystem advantage will form a strong competitive moat; even if individual model technologies iterate, Microsoft’s value as a platform player will continue to grow.

Peter Thiel’s portfolio adjustment is, in essence, a forward-looking judgment on the distribution of value within the AI industry. He is not pessimistic about the AI trend but rather believes value is shifting from the hardware layer to the platform and application layers. With its neutral platform positioning, deep enterprise customer base, and complete cloud-to-end product matrix, Microsoft is favorably positioned within this value shift. In 2026, as AI moves from technological exploration to scaled deployment, Microsoft’s ecosystem advantages are expected to amplify further.

For investors, Thiel’s moves offer a key insight: during waves of technological change, the long-term value of infrastructure and platform builders may be more resilient than that of short-term technology leaders. When the market cheers for a particular technology, calmly seeking the next link in the value chain may be the key to achieving excess returns.",https://nai500.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/AI-chips.png,N,,2026-01-03 09:59:32.784188

Još jučer zvučalo je kao šala: serumi s puževom sluzi postali su obavezan korak u kupaonicama diljem planeta. A onda je TikTok eksplodirao, izazovi su postali viralni, a mali korejski brend CosRX preko noći je postao globalno ime. Danas ga posjeduje Amorepacific, najveći kozmetički div u zemlji. Ovaj ludi uspjeh savršeno pokazuje koliko je K-beauty narastao: od internetske znatiželje do industrije koja guta tržišta i diktira što ćemo mazati na lice.

Brojke koje zvuče nestvarno: K-beauty postaje ekonomska sila

Dok se ostatak svijeta tek prilagođava, u Južnoj Koreji K-beauty je već dugo ozbiljan biznis. Domaće tržište u 2024. procijenjeno je na oko 13 milijardi dolara, a pojedine kategorije rastu dvoznamenkastim stopama. No pravi šok stiže izvana: u prvoj polovici 2025. Južna Koreja je prestigla Francusku i postala drugi najveći svjetski izvoznik beauty proizvoda, odmah iza SAD-a. K-beauty je tako ušao u klub najvećih, i to bez kočenja.

Hallyu efekt: kako su K-pop i K-drame pogurali K-beauty do vrha

Nije slučajno da je K-beauty postao opsesija baš sada: dio je korejskog vala, poznatog kao Hallyu, koji je K-pop i K-drame pretvorio u globalni fenomen. Rezultat? Police svjetskih trgovina imaju cijele odjele posvećene korejskim proizvodima, od Sephore do Walmarta. U isto vrijeme, pretražite “Korean skincare” i dobit ćete lavinu sadržaja: “unboxing”, analize sastojaka, “Get Ready With Me” i naravno “glass skin”. To je K-beauty na steroidima.

Formula uspjeha: inovacija brža od svih i trendovi koji pale internet

Srce priče je brzina. K-beauty lansira nove formule svakih nekoliko mjeseci, često dizajnirane da postanu sljedeća viralna opsesija. Nekad su rutine od deset koraka, “water sleeping mask” ili sastojci poput “salmon sperm” zvučali nišno i odbojno. Danas su normalni. Proizvod iz Seula može istog dana završiti na feedu u SAD-u, UK-u, Indiji i Australiji. No stručnjaci upozoravaju: stalna izloženost sadržaju o njezi kože može povećati tjeskobu i potaknuti pretjeranu potrošnju.

K-beauty ulazi u rat divova: kupnje, preuzimanja i kopiranje sastojaka

Veliki igrači osjećaju miris novca. L’Oréal je krajem 2024. preuzeo korejski konglomerat s brendom Dr.G, ciljajući potražnju za učinkovitim, ali pristupačnim proizvodima. U isto vrijeme, zapadne kompanije ubacuju “korejske” sastojke u svoje linije: centella asiatica, rižina voda i sve što obećava mirniju, mladolikiju kožu. U Koreji dominiraju konglomerati, takozvani chaeboli, a Amorepacific drži oko polovice domaćeg tržišta. K-beauty više nije samo trend, to je bojište.

Tvornice koje rade kao sat: kako K-beauty izbaci hit-proizvod u šest mjeseci

Da bi nahranili potražnju, Koreja ima oko 30.000 beauty brendova i industrijski ekosustav koji izgleda kao znanstvena fantastika. Ključnu ulogu imaju ODM proizvođači koji rade istraživanje, formulaciju i proizvodnju za tisuće etiketa. Cosmax, jedan od najvećih, opskrbljuje oko 4.500 brendova i 2024. je činio više od četvrtine korejskog izvoza kozmetike vrijednog 10 milijardi dolara. Zahvaljujući automatizaciji, put od ideje do prodaje može trajati samo šest mjeseci. To je K-beauty brzina koju Zapad teško prati.

Cijena ludila: tisuće propalih brendova i pritisak na transparentnost

Iza glamura stoji brutalna istina: konkurencija je toliko žestoka da su marže tanke, a propasti česte. Prema državnim podacima, više od 8.800 kozmetičkih brendova ugasilo se posljednjih godina. Influenceri sve više traže dokaz učinkovitosti, porijeklo sastojaka i manje praznih celebrity reklama. Kupci, kažu, više ne gledaju samo ime, nego sastav i rezultate. K-beauty se zato mora stalno dokazivati: ne samo da bude viralan, nego i stvarno djelotvoran.

In short, Palantir is a tougher business to understand, in my view, with a post-quarter reaction that’s even harder to gauge.
As firms continue to move ahead at full speed with AI infrastructure, the case for Nvidia stock being a reasonable value right here, I think, increases.","It seems quite risky to place a bet on either Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) moving forward, given valuations and the high stakes, as investors fear and dread an AI bubble bust. Undoubtedly, Michael Burry has bearish bets against both AI darlings. But he’s got more exposure to Palantir puts than Nvidia, likely because of the even hotter valuation and the potential for coming quarters to fall well short of expectations.

As for Nvidia, it’s the largest company on the planet, with ample catalysts in the new year. But until GPU sales fall off a cliff and buyers pass on Rubin, shares of Nvidia certainly do seem harder to short, at least in my opinion, especially when you consider that 24.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E) is nothing close to resembling a bubble. Though if the year ahead’s earnings fall well short of expectations, perhaps the seemingly cheap valuation metrics are more of a mirage than an indicator of real value.

For now, Rubin is projected to be a hit and a major catalyst that could help Nvidia stock continue defying the odds. The hyperscalers are ready to spend, and there’s probably going to be an arms race for the latest and greatest GPUs, especially when you consider the memory shortage and how it could incentivize backing up the truck whenever there’s stock, perhaps in a similar manner as the toilet paper boom during the early days of the COVID pandemic.

Billionaire Chris Rokos buys Nvidia, sells Palantir

Given Rubin Ultra, and Feynman after that, and how much is on the line to stay ahead in the AI race as Chinese rivals pick up the pace, perhaps dropping Palantir for Nvidia could be the smarter move. Undoubtedly, Michael Burry is far more bearish on one name than the other. And with famed billionaire investor Chris Rokos selling Palantir while buying into Nvidia, it seems like a smart move, not just based on relative valuation, but given the likelihood that AI demand will be in a spot to fuel a surge, the likes of which investors may not have seen since 2024.

So, should investors follow Roko’s lead by dumping Palantir for the likes of Nvidia? That’s the big question going into the new year. Personally, the valuation seems too hefty to warrant doubling down on Palantir after its latest slump, especially when you consider the magnitude of Michael Burry’s bearish bets.

Going into the new year, it feels like Burry is as confident as ever in his big bearish bets. He doesn’t think he’s too early, and he’s been keeping investors informed with his new Substack newsletter. Though I personally wouldn’t want to be a new buyer in Palantir or Nvidia, especially as the technical picture gets a bit scarier, I do think Palantir stock could stand to lose more ground if 2026 is a year when the AI bubble lets out a bit more of its air.

Nvidia certainly looks far cheaper than Palantir, even as Michael Burry stays bearish on both

Additionally, there seems to be far more visibility into Nvidia than Palantir, especially when it comes to government contracts. In short, Palantir is a tougher business to understand, in my view, with a post-quarter reaction that’s even harder to gauge. As firms continue to move ahead at full speed with AI infrastructure, the case for Nvidia stock being a reasonable value right here, I think, increases.

As for Palantir, it’s tough to tell how things will pan out as AI software companies look to get in on the action. Perhaps the ultimate pick and shovels play is still the way to go. Ultimately, I think Roko’s latest move has the potential to prove well-timed as both companies head into a new year with high expectations set ahead of them.",https://247wallst.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/imageForEntry1-pEE.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 11:59:42.314550

So when people worry about the market's high P/E ratio, remember that the number itself doesn't tell the whole story.","Editor's note: The market rocketed to one new high after another in 2025... And if you're like many folks, you might be starting to worry. But as Joe Austin from our corporate affiliate Chaikin Analytics explains, the measure of value most folks are looking at can be misleading.

In today's Weekend Edition, we're taking a break from our usual fare to share a recent piece from the free Chaikin PowerFeed e-letter. In it, Joe explains why this metric isn't enough on its own – and reveals a better way to think about the full picture in investing.

When the market is up, people start to worry about valuations...

And one of the most popular valuation metrics is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

The calculation is simple. Divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share.

Right now, the S&P 500 Index trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of more than 30 times. Historically, that's high. But as we'll explain, this one metric doesn't tell the full story...

Here's what the P/E ratio for U.S. stocks looks like on a longer-term basis...

""Bears"" often cite high P/E ratios as a reason for caution...

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently got on this bandwagon. Back in September, he sent the market tumbling by noting in a speech that ""equity prices are fairly highly valued.""

But it's not so cut-and-dried on how important the P/E ratio is...

I talked with my colleague and Chaikin Analytics founder Marc Chaikin for his take on the importance of the P/E ratio – particularly its role in determining Power Gauge ratings.

At Chaikin Analytics, we use the Power Gauge to analyze the markets. This key tool gathers investment fundamentals and technicals into a simple rating of ""bullish,"" ""neutral,"" or ""bearish.""

Marc said that in the 1980s and 1990s, P/E ratios were highly relevant in identifying attractive stocks. Price-to-sales (P/S) ratios later took priority... then yielded to earnings growth and momentum.

Today, the Power Gauge uses the projected P/E ratio within the Earnings category, which is just one of the categories it looks at to determine a stock's rating. And it ranks that ratio on a relative basis versus other stocks.

If the projected P/E ratio drifts upward, that isn't automatically a bad sign. What matters is how the ratio ranks versus other stocks – not the absolute number.

Of course, people love to talk about P/E ratios. And they usually infer that a high P/E ratio is bad... and that a low P/E ratio is good.

But that doesn't always hold true in practice. Let's look at a couple of examples...

Two Vastly Different Moves Following 'Low' and 'High' P/E Ratios

First is athletic apparel company Lululemon Athletica (LULU)...

As a brand, Lululemon is a massive success.

The company's clothes are everywhere. And folks love them...

When asked whether they considered themselves loyal customers, 83% of Lululemon's customers said ""yes.""

And 8 out of every 10 Lululemon customers join the company's membership program. As of 2024, that program had 22 million members.

To an investor, that looks like a formidable competitive moat.

And going into 2024, Lululemon's stock looked attractive based on its historical P/E range...

As you can see, its P/E ratio had dropped from almost 90 times to around 64 times. Investors might have thought they were getting a bargain.

But consider how Lululemon's stock ended up performing...

It fell by about 25% in 2024. And it ended 2025 down roughly 46%.

As it turns out, Lululemon's products had become stale and predictable – particularly in its core U.S. market, where sales were declining.

And buying the stock just because its P/E ratio looked cheap would've lost you a lot of money.

A different example is Big Pharma firm Eli Lilly (LLY)...

Lilly's drugs Zepbound and Mounjaro generated $10.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone. This made tirzepatide – which is behind both Zepbound and Mounjaro – the world's bestselling drug. Lilly now controls about 58% of the obesity drug market.

But Lilly looked expensive in January 2024. Its P/E ratio had more than tripled – from less than 30 times to more than 100 times. A skeptic would've said you were paying way too much for the stock.

Take a look at this chart...

Since then, Lilly has soared. The stock jumped by about 32% in 2024. And it closed out 2025 up roughly 40%.

These examples reveal something important...

There's More to a Good Investment Than the P/E Ratio

A low P/E ratio doesn't guarantee a good investment. And a high P/E ratio doesn't mean you should automatically avoid a stock.

Business quality and growth potential matter more than one simple valuation metric.

Plus, some stocks are cyclical – think automakers, homebuilders, and industrial companies.

Cyclical stocks flip that ""low P/E ratio"" versus ""high P/E ratio"" logic on its head...

They'll often look cheapest (with a low P/E ratio) at the worst possible time to buy. That's usually right before earnings collapse.

And the opposite is also true...

Cyclical stocks often look most expensive (with a high P/E ratio) at the best time to buy. That's when earnings have hit bottom and are about to rebound.

True, the S&P 500's valuation of more than 30 times trailing 12-month earnings is high. But again, P/E ratios alone don't determine investment success.

A stock with a low P/E ratio can still be a terrible investment if the business is deteriorating. Meanwhile, a high P/E ratio can be a powerful signal of a company's growth prospects.

So when people worry about the market's high P/E ratio, remember that the number itself doesn't tell the whole story.

In investing, what really matters is finding quality businesses with strong fundamentals and growth potential.

Good investing,

ChatGPT is morphing into an operating system, and OpenAI is designing devices with Jony Ive to replace the iPhone. The vision: users complete tasks through chatbots instead of smartphone apps, threatening Apple’s walled garden.

The reality: Journal tests show occasional wow moments surrounded by dysfunction. Traditional apps remain too capable to replace quickly.

Instacart Works Seamlessly—By Exception

ChatGPT created a vegetarian weekly menu and filled a Costco cart with ingredients, linking directly to checkout. The success required three months of joint development, shared offices, and a former Instacart CEO (now OpenAI executive) breaking a development logjam.

This level of integration isn’t scalable across the app ecosystem.

Most Apps Add Friction Rather Than Remove It

Uber inside ChatGPT estimates costs but cannot book rides—users must retype addresses on a separate webpage. OpenTable gave error messages on reservation requests. Tripadvisor showed maps for 30 seconds before failing. “Tripadvisor is being a little useless,” ChatGPT admitted.

Users Must Know Magic Incantations

Connecting to apps requires “@uber” syntax and precise phrasing. “How do I get an Uber?” fails; users must know the exact commands. This defeats the purpose of natural language interfaces.

Developers Are There for the Audience

All 12 developers interviewed said they built ChatGPT apps because their users are there—800 million of them. But apps are designed to steer users back to more capable smartphone apps or websites.

The Tollbooth Economics Are Real

Instacart pays OpenAI a transaction fee based on basket value at checkout. Whoever provides the gateway to online services owns valuable real estate—today that is Apple with its App Store fees at 30% versus OpenAI’s emerging 10-15%.

ChatGPT’s app ecosystem resembles the early App Store: primitive, inconsistent, occasionally magical. Apple’s iPhone apps took years to mature into indispensable tools.

From the environment to emergencies, millions of images at the service of countries

Since its first launch in 2007, the constellation has collected approximately 4,3 million images, become an essential tool for the environmental and territorial monitoring, security, and emergency management. COSMO-SkyMed data also feed European observation systems, including Copernicus, and are used by numerous international institutional users.

As the initial hype fades, human insight - paired with AI tools - could drive a recovery.

British giant WPP saw its shares plummet around 60% over the year, driven by client losses, multiple profit warnings, and fears of AI disruption eroding margins. Rivals like Omnicom, Publicis Groupe, and Interpublic Group (IPG) also faced pressure, though less severe, amid a broader narrative of agencies losing ground to automated solutions from Big Tech.

Yet, this downturn may prove temporary. Analysts argue that AI's efficiencies could spark an ""arms race"" in creative spending, while agencies' expertise in complex strategy and budget allocation remains irreplaceable. As the initial hype fades, human insight - paired with AI tools - could drive a recovery.

The AI-Driven Sell-Off: Facts from 2025

WPP's struggles epitomize the sector's pain. The company issued profit warnings in July and October, forecasting revenue declines of 3-6% and citing client caution, economic uncertainty, and a sharp drop in new business pitches (down to one-third of prior levels). Shares hit multi-decade lows, with the stock relegated from the FTSE 100 in December after a 62% yearly drop. CEO transitions and restructuring followed, including heavy AI investments to counter the threat.

Peers weren't immune: Omnicom and IPG stocks dipped amid similar concerns, though Omnicom's $13 billion acquisition of IPG (closed November 2025) created the world's largest agency group, aiming for $750 million in synergies. Publicis fared better, leveraging its CoreAI platform for growth. Overall, agency valuations hit lows not seen since 2020, with Barclays downgrading several in mid-2025 over immediate AI risks.

Client behavior fueled the fire. Brands increasingly build internal AI teams, bypassing agencies for routine tasks. Coca-Cola's 2025 holiday campaign - fully AI-generated for the second year - exemplified this: Produced with far fewer staff (20 vs. 50 traditionally), it prioritized cost savings despite backlash over ""uncanny"" visuals and perceived lack of soul. Executives defended it as forward-thinking, but consumers criticized the ""slop,"" highlighting tensions in AI adoption.

Google's Tools: Automation Without Full Replacement

Google amplified the disruption with updates to Performance Max and the new AI Max for Search suite (launched May 2025). These AI-powered features automate bidding, creatives, targeting, and even ad copy, promising 14-27% more conversions. While empowering in-house teams, they haven't solved core challenges like optimal budget allocation across fragmented channels—a human forte rooted in experience and intuition.

As one report noted, AI excels at execution but struggles with strategic nuance in a multi-platform world. Agencies like WPP are responding by developing proprietary AI (e.g., WPP Open), positioning themselves as integrators rather than casualties.

Why the Pain May Be Short-Lived

Lower AI production costs could boost overall ad spend, per JPMorgan analysts, igniting competition for standout campaigns. Agencies' vast data troves and cross-channel expertise remain hard to replicate. Morningstar's Mark Giarelli emphasized: ""The industry is being disrupted, but it’s not being disintermediated.""

Consumer shifts add complexity: Younger audiences favor ""quiet luxury,"" minimalism, influencer collabs, and resale over logo-heavy ads. Navigating this - plus ethical AI use and regulatory hurdles - demands professional guidance. As neuro-hype cools, agencies blending human creativity with AI could thrive.

In 2025, AI dented agency stocks profoundly, but the sector's resilience suggests a pivot ahead. For marketers, the future isn't obsolescence - it's evolution. Hold tight; the rebound might just be loading.

Leading wire-to-wire, the Wolverines (13-0, 3-0) faced little consternation after an initial flurry, the only exception being when standout forward Yaxel Lendeborg left for the locker room late in the first half.

Any concerns of serious injury were quickly assuaged, however, when Lendeborg rejoined the lineup to start the second half. He finished with a muted offensive stat line, scoring all eight of his points early and shooting just 3 of 10 from the floor, but it did little to hinder Michigan.

Their first-half struggles compounded seconds before intermission when, after he committed a turnover on the offensive end, Chad Baker-Mazara fouled Nimari Burnett on the ensuing Michigan fast break to garner his fourth personal.

The sequence sent Michigan into halftime ahead by 18 points and contributed to Baker-Mazara scoring just 12 points, almost 10 fewer than his season average coming into Friday’s contest.

Michigan shot just 6 of 30 from 3-point range on the night, but USC was unable to capitalize against a stingy Michigan defense. The Wolverines held the Trojans to just 20 of 58 shooting from the floor while forcing USC into 21 turnovers.

Michigan’s defensive dominance included three blocked shots from Lendeborg, three steals from Aday Mara, and two steals each from Elliot Cadeau and Johnson.

Cadeau also helped fuel the balanced Wolverines offense that featured five players scoring in double figures, dishing a game-high seven assists and grabbing six rebounds to match Johnson and Mara for the team lead.

Jaden Brownell came off the bench to lead USC with 16 points and six rebounds before fouling out. Ausar scored 15 points and grabbed six rebounds.",https://v4.dailysportspage.com/cumulus/image/856443/600/400/,N,,2026-01-03 06:57:57.810824

It is the third banking hub to open in the county, with similar services already in Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett.
""But the irony is not lost on the whole of Westbury that the banking hub is going into a building which was a bank.
The [return of a] banking hub and a post office are two things we've worked doggedly on.""
The official opening of the banking hub will take place on 9 January at 11:00 GMT, with campaigner Val Jarvis - who launched a petition to reinstate banking services to Westbury - set to cut the ribbon.","A permanent banking hub has opened in a town after years of campaign work.

The facility on the High Street in Westbury, Wiltshire, is operating in a former Barclays bank building which shut in 2019.

It is the third banking hub to open in the county, with similar services already in Calne and Royal Wootton Bassett.

""It's brilliant news,"" said Westbury's mayor, Jane Russ. ""But the irony is not lost on the whole of Westbury that the banking hub is going into a building which was a bank. The [return of a] banking hub and a post office are two things we've worked doggedly on.""

Banking hubs offer a counter service operated by the Post Office, where customers can carry out cash transactions, ask questions and receive advice.

Westbury's new banking hub was recommended by LINK, the UK's ATM network, after a community request and campaign work by residents, Westbury Town Council and former mayor Sheila Kimmins.

Gareth Oakley, CEO at Cash Access UK, which runs the facility, said it would ensure ""crucial access to cash and face-to-face banking services for residents and businesses across the community"".

While the new hub was being refurbished, a temporary one was set up at the Laverton building in Westbury.

It is hoped the permanent location will complement Westbury's rotunda project, which will see a space near the town's library used to host more events.

Ms Russ said: ""The temporary banking hub was a little out of town and up a hill which meant it wasn't useful for everyone. I'm delighted this new permanent hub has been sorted out.

""By the time we've got the rotunda sorted, this will all suddenly alter the whole feel of the high street in Westbury. If a town looks loved, it will be.""

The official opening of the banking hub will take place on 9 January at 11:00 GMT, with campaigner Val Jarvis - who launched a petition to reinstate banking services to Westbury - set to cut the ribbon.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/360e/live/9db3b300-e7b2-11f0-a5c4-2f5ecdd63f6f.png,N,,2026-01-03 02:58:47.652389

Processing Content

""We expect strong borrower credit profiles, relatively stable employment levels, and persistent home price appreciation to help mitigate pressures from ongoing housing-affordability challenges,"" Fitch analysts Christopher Grimes, Tana Marcom and Laura Kaster wrote.

Fitch's outlook incorporates the impact of the potential stress of a slowing U.S. economy in 2026 on mortgage insurers, the report issued on Dec. 30 said.

""New business pricing has been stable, with conservative underwriting across the industry amid economic uncertainty,"" Fitch said.

All of the active firms are adopting black-box pricing, which has also led to market share shifts.

Meanwhile, Fitch expressed a small level of concern regarding default activity in 2026; mortgage insurers only pay out claims after the loan goes into foreclosure.

""Headline unemployment figures have not meaningfully risen, but the pace of recent hiring activity has been slowing, which could pressure some borrowers if hiring slows further in 2026,"" the report said. ""However, strong borrower credit characteristics and favorable home equity appreciation for most homeowners should moderate the frequency and severity of ultimate MI claims.""

Rising originations effect on MI

Mortgage originations are expected to increase this year, and this will benefit the mortgage insurers' new insurance written volume, Fitch said. Fannie Mae projects $2.37 trillion for 2026, up from $1.92 trillion; the Mortgage Bankers Association's forecast is for $2.2 trillion, compared with $2.05 trillion during 2025.

But unlike title insurance, MI production is not correlated with total loan volume. Private MI is used in the conforming market only for originations with loan-to-value ratio over 80%. It is not needed for many non-qualified mortgages. Government-guarantee programs cover other loans.

""NIW credit quality has not deteriorated despite home-affordability challenges,"" the Fitch report added. ""MI competitors in aggregate reported relatively stable delinquency levels in the third quarter, with the overall industry delinquency rate increasing to 2.15% from 1.98% year-over-year.""

The increase is likely a result of normal portfolio seasoning and typical calendar-based seasonal loss activity, the analysts continued.

Just under half of the current insurance-in-force as of the end of the third quarter was produced between 2020 and 2022.

Persistency, a measure of how much business remains on the books from 12 months' prior, is likely to come under pressure if rates decline further, resulting in higher portfolio turnover. Through Sept. 30, 2025, persistency averaged 84% over the prior 12 months.

""Fitch believes a disciplined approach to capital management, characterized by strong private mortgage insurer eligibility requirements (PMIERS) ratios, strategic capital allocation, and a focus on liquidity will continue to bolster ratings in the MI sector in 2026,"" the report noted.

The rating agency will continue to monitor merger and acquisition trends to expand beyond the core business, such as Radian's decision to buy a specialty insurer while selling its title, conduit and real estate services businesses.

""Additionally, the privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could mean greater opportunities for private MIs, but also invite more regulatory and market uncertainty, requiring careful capital and risk management,"" Grimes, Marcom and Kaster wrote.

How the large title insurers will do in 2026

Earlier in December, Fitch also put out a title insurance outlook, which also is neutral, ""reflecting expectations for stable profitability and ratings.

""Strong capital positions, modestly higher origination volumes, and continued expense management will support the sector's margins and ratings in the coming year,"" Fitch said.

Title loss ratios should remain at favorable levels, as the underwriters benefit from premium growth and a continued focus on expense management.

""Risks to sector performance include a substantial increase in mortgage rates, tighter credit conditions or economic deterioration, which could pressure volumes and margins,"" a press release said. ""However, Fitch's baseline scenario anticipates manageable headwinds and continued stability in ratings for the sector in 2026.""

The Federal Housing Finance Agency's Title Acceptance Pilot — introduced by the Biden Administration and expanded by current director Bill Pulte — will not affect the sector's ratings because of its limited scope.

On Dec. 3, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods held its annual title day, with the four major underwriters.

The tone regarding the industry's regulation from the four companies — Fidelity National Financial, First American, Stewart and Old Republic — was ""fairly positive,"" KBW said, with no incremental updates from the FHFA and Bill Pulte, its director. The title pilot ends in May.

One regulatory cloud on the title business is a 6.2% reduction in rates in Texas, which state regulators will put into effect on March 1 (the rollback was finalized on Dec. 12, 2025).

Regulators have previously pushed for a 10% reduction, which was put on hold by a court injunction.

""FNF had disclosed earlier that the impact of even a 10% premium reduction in Texas would be negligible,"" the KBW report said.

How commercial real estate sales affect title companies in 2026

Expectations that commercial real estate transaction volume will grow this year are another positive for the title business in the Fitch report. Rated national title underwriters' ability to maintain favorable margins because of their higher premiums versus residential transactions is contingent on this trend.

In the first nine months of last year, the commercial business was a significant 20% share of premiums.

KBW takes a similar position on the impact of commercial real estate transactions for title insurers this year.

""While the timing of any recovery in the residential purchase market remains uncertain, the title insurance sector should continue to benefit from the strong level of activity in the commercial real estate market, which is expected to continue into 2026 and should provide a bridge to an eventual recovery in the purchase market,"" the report on the event from Bose George and Frankie Labetti said.",https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89992d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1020x536+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsource-media-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F22%2F6b6236db493d8417508e1c0c9e65%2Fnmn010226-fitch-16x9.png,N,,2026-01-03 10:59:54.158515

Light strips and other lights with a gradient function now offer another mode in addition to Linear, Mirrored, and Diffuse. In this blog post, you’ll learn what “Segmented” is all about.

Where exactly can you find the new mode and the different styles? It’s very simple: First, select the desired gradient light in the Hue app and then activate a color in the colorful color wheel. A small button will appear at the bottom right of the brightness control. Tap on it to open a menu showing the available modes.

Linear: Creates a linear color gradient where you can freely set three light points. The colors in between are generated automatically.

Mirrored: A linear color gradient in which the effect is mirrored in the middle of the light strip.

Scattered: Up to five colors of your choice are mixed and distributed across the various lights (such as the Hue Festavia string of lights) or the zones of the light strip.

Segmented: You can select up to five different colors. Unlike in linear mode, no color gradients are generated between the colors.

If the new mode is not yet visible to you, a software update may be necessary. It is best to activate the automatic update and leave the light strip or light connected to the power supply.

This is what the new Hue effect looks like

I have already tried out the new segmented mode with a Philips Hue Flux light strip, which I installed behind a Kallax shelf. Here you can clearly see the four different colors I selected in the Hue app. The individual segments are clearly separated and, unlike before, no color gradients are generated.

Unfortunately, there are still some things that don’t work: you can’t combine true white tones with colorful colors. Likewise, individual segments of the light strip cannot be switched off or display a different brightness.",https://hueblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hue-app4_home-dashboard.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 02:58:52.903279

Frontier Airlines sends threatening note to flight attendants In the run-up to New Year’s Eve 2025, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received the following email addressing a spike in sickness amongst crew members: ""Let me make it clear: this trend is unacceptable and unsustainable.
The vast majority of our flight attendants consistently uphold their responsibilities with professionalism and dependability, and this policy reinforces that standard.""
As Frontier provided prior warning, it can legitimately ask all flight attendants to provide a doctor’s note for sick calls.
In a memo to its members, however, the AFA urged flight attendants to prioritize their health.","With cases of flu and other respiratory illnesses surging across the United States, it’s probably not surprising that sick calls are spiking in workplaces around the country. Not least, in customer-facing jobs where employees are surrounded by sick and infectious people.

But just before the New Year, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received an unusually blunt email from the Denver-based budget carrier. The tone was painfully clear: the airline believes that crew members are abusing their sick leave, and Frontier was going to take action to stamp it out.

Frontier Airlines sends threatening note to flight attendants

In the run-up to New Year’s Eve 2025, flight attendants at Frontier Airlines received the following email addressing a spike in sickness amongst crew members:

""Let me make it clear: this trend is unacceptable and unsustainable. While illness and legitimate emergencies do happen, the frequency and timing of sick calls have reached a point where we can confidently say this protection is no longer being used as intended and where drastic action is now necessary.

Reliability is a fundamental expectation of this role that each of us committed to when choosing this career. When absenteeism increases, aircraft don't takeoff, schedules collapse, and trust, both internally and externally is eroded.""

So, how does Frontier plan to slash sickness rates? Since December 30, 2025, flight attendants are expected to provide a doctor’s note for any sickness.

Frontier says the policy is being enforced “without exception” and that failure to provide an official sick note will go down as an unexcused absence, which could then lead to disciplinary proceedings.

The email from Frontier added:

""This action is necessary to safeguard operational integrity and ensure fairness to those who act responsibly every day. The vast majority of our flight attendants consistently uphold their responsibilities with professionalism and dependability, and this policy reinforces that standard.""

Union says airline is within its rights

When you’re stuck in a metal tube for up to 12 hours or longer a day, surrounded by members of the public, battling tiredness from early starts and late finishes, and staying in different hotels every night, it’s probably no surprise that sickness rates amongst flight attendants are higher than the average office worker.

It appears, however, that Frontier doesn’t believe the spike in sick calls is completely down to legitimate sickness. But while the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), which represents crew members at Frontier, says it doesn’t agree with the policy or the tone or the email from the airline, it says Frontier is well within its rights.

Under the current flight attendant contract, Frontier is allowed to impose periods where all flight attendants must present a doctor’s note for sickness, so long as prior warning is given.

As Frontier provided prior warning, it can legitimately ask all flight attendants to provide a doctor’s note for sick calls. And while the contract provides examples like the Christmas Holidays or Super Bowl weekend when fake sick calls might spike, it appears as if Frontier is allowed to designate periods whenever it thinks it is required.

In a memo to its members, however, the AFA urged flight attendants to prioritize their health. “While attendance expectations exist, no one should feel pressured to fly while sick,” the memo read. “Taking care of yourself protects you, your crew, and your passengers.”

CDC estimates 7.5 million flu cases so far this season

After a particularly rough flu season during flu season in Australia and New Zealand, health experts have been anticipating a similar trend in Europe and North America. Unfortunately, those predictions are proving to be correct.

As of December 20, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 7.5 million flu illnesses so far this season, resulting in 81,000 hospitalizations, and 3,100 deaths.

In its weekly influenza report, the CDC warned that flu activity is “elevated and continues to increase across the country.”

United Airlines won a legal battle to demand a doctor’s note

In July 2024, United Airlines also introduced a mandatory doctor’s note policy for all sick calls from flight attendants after witnessing a spike in callouts from crew members that allegedly coincided with weekends.

Giving flight attendants just 24 hours’ notice of the policy, United said it would require an absence certificate obtained at the crew members’ expense if they reported sick for any trip that departed on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

The United branch of AFA-CWA called the policy ‘reprehensible’ and launched a legal challenge, arguing that their contract prohibited United from demanding absence certificates with the exception of the Fourth of July and Christmas holiday period.

Nearly a year later, an independent arbitrator said the flight attendant contract did, in fact, give United the unilateral power to demand an absence certificate when there was evidence of “abuse or misuse of sick leave.”

United had provided evidence to the arbitrator that showed a “dramatic and sustained surge in weekend sick calls,” with sickness rates at the weekend surging to 22% in the months before the policy was implemented.

Ultimately, United suspended the weekend sickness policy just weeks after it was implemented, claiming that it had achieved the desired effect of reducing sick calls back to acceptable levels.",https://www.paddleyourownkanoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1445228615-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 06:57:53.949237

Wie das Unternehmen am Freitag mitteilte, liegen nun alle erforderlichen behördlichen Genehmigungen für die geplante strategische Partnerschaft vor. Die Zusammenarbeit trat bereits Mittwoch offiziell in Kraft.

Für Anleger stellt sich die Frage, welche konkreten Vorteile diese Kooperation für UPM-Kymmene bringen könnte. Die Genehmigungsphase ist abgeschlossen, doch die eigentliche Bewährungsprobe steht noch bevor.

Partnerschaft im Holzsektor nimmt Gestalt an

Die strategische Allianz zwischen UPM-Kymmene und Versowood zielt darauf ab, die Position beider Unternehmen im Bereich der Holzverarbeitung zu stärken. Während UPM-Kymmene als diversifizierter Forstkonzern mit Aktivitäten von Papier bis Bioenergie bekannt ist, bringt Versowood spezialisierte Kompetenzen in der Holzindustrie ein.

Der Zeitpunkt der Genehmigung zum Jahresende lässt vermuten, dass beide Partner zügig mit der operativen Umsetzung beginnen wollen. Dennoch bleibt abzuwarten, wie schnell sich mögliche Synergieeffekte tatsächlich realisieren lassen. Regulatorische Hürden sind überwunden, doch die Integration zweier Unternehmenskulturen erfordert Zeit und sorgfältige Planung.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Upm-Kymmene?

Unklare Details zur operativen Ausgestaltung

Die vorliegende Mitteilung bleibt in wesentlichen Punkten zurückhaltend. Weder zu den finanziellen Rahmenbedingungen noch zu konkreten Zielen der Partnerschaft wurden Details genannt. Für Investoren erschwert dies die Einschätzung, welchen Beitrag die Kooperation zum Unternehmensergebnis leisten könnte.

Im Kontext der europäischen Forstindustrie erscheint eine Konsolidierung durchaus nachvollziehbar. Der Sektor steht unter Druck durch schwankende Rohstoffpreise und veränderte Nachfragemuster. Strategische Allianzen könnten helfen, Kosten zu senken und Marktanteile zu sichern.

Anleger dürften nun gespannt auf weitere Informationen warten. Wie sich die Partnerschaft auf die Margen auswirkt und welche Investitionen erforderlich sind, wird sich in den kommenden Quartalsberichten zeigen müssen.

Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States, he signed an executive order creating the MAHA Commission.
“The American food system is safe but could be healthier,” the commission said.
“We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply,” Kennedy Jr. said.
During the Institute of Food Technologists’ IFT FIRST conference in July, Martin Hahn, partner at Hogan Lovells US, recommended manufacturers adopt a short-term strategy of aligning product development with the goals of MAHA.","KANSAS CITY — Make America healthy again (MAHA) has transitioned from political slogan to a federal initiative spearheaded by the US Department of Health and Human Services and intended to drive change throughout the food and beverage supply chain. As a result, manufacturers of products perceived as ultra processed or containing shunned ingredients like additives, artificial colors or synthetic colors are under pressure to reformulate. The challenge facing companies is many MAHA initiatives are founded in perception and not supported by science.

Shortly after Donald Trump was sworn in as president of the United States, he signed an executive order creating the MAHA Commission. In May, the commission published a report it said was intended to reduce the incidence of chronic diseases in children by reducing their exposure to ultra-processed foods (UPFs), chemicals like pesticides and ensuring they are not over medicated.

“The American food system is safe but could be healthier,” the commission said. “Most children’s diets are dominated by ultra-processed foods high in sugars, chemical additives and saturated fats while lacking sufficient intakes of fruits and vegetables.”

The commission noted that nearly 70% of an American child’s calories today come from UPFs. The report provided a broad definition of UPFs as “packaged or ready-consume products that are formulated for shelf life and/or palatability but are typically high in added sugars, refined grains, unhealthy fats, sodium and low in fiber and essential nutrients.”

Statistically, the report claimed roughly 70% of the over 300,000 branded food products available in grocery stores today are ultra processed.

Three problematic ingredients identified in the report were ultra-processed grains, sugars and fats.

“These engineered components, virtually nonexistent a century ago, now account for over two-thirds of all calories consumed by American children,” the report said.

Other ingredients identified as contributing to the poor health of American children included emulsifiers, binders, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives, specifically, titanium dioxide, propylparaben, butylated hydroxytoluene and artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and saccharin.

“Additives in processed foods are consumed in complex combinations, where cumulative and synergistic effects may amplify harm beyond individual components,” according to the report. “Yet, testing often ignores these interactions, particularly in children. With dozens of additives consumed daily, these overlooked risks could be significantly impacting children’s health.”

The report drew swift responses from industry groups, with the main critiques being a lack of inclusiveness in its development and the evidence used to support its recommendations.

In a letter to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the HHS, more than 250 food and agriculture groups requested an opportunity to participate in future decisions by the committee.

“As organizations representing millions of farmers, ranchers, food producers and ingredient manufacturers, we write to urge you to ensure food and agriculture have a seat at the table during the development of policy recommendations related to the recent Make America Healthy Again Commission report, as well as any future commission activities,” the letter said. “The process by which the commission’s most recent report was created lacked transparency and any opportunity for public engagement. As a result, the report contained numerous errors and distortions that have created unfounded fears about the safety of our food supply.”

Additionally, the letter included references to an article published by the news service Notus that said while the MAHA Commission report cited over 500 studies, the citations contained errors ranging from broken website links to misstated conclusions. Seven of the cited sources did not appear to exist at all, according to the Notus article.

The industry response may have resonated, because when a second MAHA Commission report was published in September, its recommendations focused on removing foods perceived as unhealthy from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and revising the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

Going forward, the second report recommended research be conducted on the health effects of products such as UPFs.

“NIH (the National Institutes of Health) will partner with FDA (the Food and Drug Administration), USDA, and the administration for a Healthy America to conduct high quality nutrition research and ingredient assessments,” the second report said. “As part of this effort, NIH will expand research on dietary patterns that support metabolic health. NIH and HHS will take steps to fully utilize the newly created FDA and NIH Joint Nutrition Regulatory Science Program. USDA will prioritize precision nutrition research.”

The FDA also has begun the process of defining UPFs, seeking information from interested parties about what constitutes such products.

“We must act boldly to eliminate the root causes of chronic illness and improve the health of our food supply,” Kennedy Jr. said. “Defining ultra-processed foods with a clear, uniform standard will empower us even more to make America healthy again.”

While MAHA’s primary focus has been on UPFs, its most significant impact has been on the use of synthetic colors in formulations. In April, the FDA said it intended to phase out the use of petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

While the FDA’s current initiatives are voluntary, many food and beverage companies have said they plan to stop using the ingredients.The main reason is states like California, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia have passed laws banning the ingredients, and, even though federal law is supposed to supersede state law, the FDA has shown no intention of asserting its authority to regulate food ingredients.

That has left food manufacturers with few options other than to begin phasing out synthetic dyes.

During the Institute of Food Technologists’ IFT FIRST conference in July, Martin Hahn, partner at Hogan Lovells US, recommended manufacturers adopt a short-term strategy of aligning product development with the goals of MAHA.

“MAHA has been very effective at getting states to pass ingredient bans, so when you are formulating products today, you need to be aware of those states that have banned ingredients, such as certified colors being banned in West Virginia,” he said. “We need to be formulating products today that will be compliant with future regulations.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2025/05/27/MAHA-lead----WINDCOLORS.jpg?height=635&t=1748354435&width=1200,N,,2026-01-03 07:57:52.587700

The change is aimed at addressing long-standing consumer complaints about partial reimbursements and limited customer service options.
Delivery platforms will now be required to provide customers with an itemized breakdown of each transaction and offer access to a human customer service representative.
The measure builds on California’s Fair Food Delivery Act of 2020, which imposed a series of restrictions on third-party delivery platforms following allegations of unfair business practices.
That earlier law capped delivery fees and required greater transparency between restaurants, delivery companies and customers.","Food delivery apps will soon have to change how they handle refunds in California.

Starting Thursday, Jan. 1, a new state law will require platforms like DoorDash, Uber Eats and others to issue full cash refunds rather than in-app credits when customers experience missing or incorrect orders. The change is aimed at addressing long-standing consumer complaints about partial reimbursements and limited customer service options.

Under Assembly Bill 578, authored by Democratic Assemblywoman Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who has said her own experience with food delivery problems helped inspire the legislation, food delivery companies must refund the full amount of an order, including taxes and tips, to the customer’s original payment method when a delivery is not completed as promised. In cases where only part of an order is missing or incorrect, companies are still permitted to issue partial refunds.

The law also introduces new transparency and customer service requirements. Delivery platforms will now be required to provide customers with an itemized breakdown of each transaction and offer access to a human customer service representative. Human contact is mandatory when a customer’s issue cannot be resolved through automated systems, according to the filing.

In addition, AB 578 includes safeguards designed to address potential fraud, allowing companies to investigate suspicious refund requests while still complying with the law’s consumer protection standards.

The measure builds on California’s Fair Food Delivery Act of 2020, which imposed a series of restrictions on third-party delivery platforms following allegations of unfair business practices. That earlier law capped delivery fees and required greater transparency between restaurants, delivery companies and customers.

Gov. Gavin Newsom signed AB 578 into law in October. The California governor framed the bill as part of a broader push to strengthen consumer protections in the state.

“California is hard at work to help make your life more affordable,” Newsom said in a statement at the time. “These new laws reflect who we are: a state that protects workers, respects students, puts people before politics, and isn't afraid to hold powerful interests accountable.”

Consumer advocates have long criticized food delivery platforms for relying on app credits instead of cash refunds, arguing that credits can expire, limit customer choice and pressure users to continue using the same service after a negative experience. Supporters of AB 578 say the new requirements ensure customers are properly compensated when a delivery fails, without strings attached.",https://people.com/thmb/9OsgjM3336fkIyZQHBkhctR_908=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(639x0:641x2)/food-delivery-app-wars-grubhub-vs-uber-eats-5080528-1-22f63d30687d4b8bbb113b9e9e9c6915.png,N,,2026-01-02 23:58:24.930723

Close to half of respondents predicted a rise in output in the new year, the company said in a release on Friday.

In December, confidence strengthened for the third month running and was the highest since March 2024.

The S&P Global Vietnam Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index ended the year at 53.0, down slightly from 53.8 in November but still comfortably above the 50.0 no change mark and signalling a solid monthly improvement in the overall health of the sector, the company stated.

Andrew Harker, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote in the release: ""The Vietnamese manufacturing sector ended a turbulent year on a positive note, with output and new orders rising solidly again and business confidence hitting a 21-month high.""

""Overall, the sector goes into 2026 in a positive position, with manufacturers optimistic of securing new business and being able to expand their production capacity. S &P Global Market Intelligence forecasts industrial production growth of 6.7% in 2026,"" he added.

The final month of 2025 saw the Vietnamese manufacturing sector remain ""firmly inside growth territory"".

Firms expanded output solidly again amid rising new orders, with better weather conditions helping to boost capacity. Employment increased, aiding efforts to reduce backlogs of work.

Vietnamese manufacturers again registered growth of production in December, extending the current sequence of expansion to eight months.

Although weather conditions were more stable in December, the severe typhoons and flooding seen in previous months continued to impact the manufacturing sector at the end of the year, principally due to the effect of damage to raw materials on their delivery and supplier delays caused by flooding.

Suppliers' delivery times lengthened markedly again, within stances of delays only slightly less pronounced than the three-and-a-half year record posted in November.

Meanwhile, input costs increased at the fastest pace since June 2022 amid material scarcity and unfavourable exchange rate movements. In turn, output prices increased solidly, with the pace of inflation little-changed from November. The latest rise was much faster than the average for 2025 as a whole.

Although input costs increased rapidly, manufacturers still raised their purchasing activity sharply amid higher new orders and greater output requirements. Moreover, the pace of growth quickened to a 16-month high. Stocks of inputs also rose, the third month running in which this has been the case.

Stocks of finished goods, on the other hand, fell solidly as completed items were dispatched promptly to customers.

The National Assembly, Vietnam's legislature, on November 12 approved a resolution setting an economic expansion target of at least 10% for 2026, per capita GDP at $5,400-5,500, and inflation controlled at around 4.5%.

The government aimed to enlarge the national economy by 8.3-8.5% for 2025. GDP grew 7.85% in the first nine months. The figure was the second-highest levels in 11 years, except for 2023 which saw a strong surge post the pandemic.

Vietnam's economic outcomes in 2025 are yet to be released by the General Statistics Office.

Standard Chartered in late October raised its Vietnam GDP growth forecast to 7.5% for 2025 from the previous 6.1%, and to 7.2% for 2026 from 6.2%, following HSBC's revising up its prediction to 7.9% (from 6.6%) and 6.7% (from 5.8%), respectively.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/news/2026/01/03/screenshot-2026-01-03-102557-105820.png,N,,2026-01-03 11:14:19.472129

“It’s been throughout the games, and obviously me playing him more minutes and making sure that he can continue to play.","The Nets trailed for the final 28 minutes of Thursday night’s loss to the Rockets.

But that doesn’t mean those minutes were meaningless.

Coach Jordi Fernández gave rookie Nolan Traore some tough love coming off the court after some ill-advised 3-point heaves made that clear.

The French teen is a good penetrator and downhill player but had just two assists to two turnovers, and shot just 1-for-8 overall, 1-for-5 from deep on shots he was mostly lured into.

“I need him to use his superpowers and touch the paint. And it felt like he got caught shooting the unders. And a lot of times it didn’t go … because that’s what they want you to do,” Fernández said. “And if you keep shooting and missing, then sometimes, if you keep doing the same thing and seeing the same results, that’s the definition of insanity. And I know how good he is.

“He can play pick-and-roll; he can touch the paint; he can reject pick-and-rolls; he can play with a pass. Two assists and two turnovers is just not good enough. That’s why I needed him to understand: that I need more. I’m OK with a pull-up 3; I don’t love it because he hasn’t shown that he can make it consistently. He can shoot as many catch-and-shoot 3s as he wants, but I didn’t think he played the game the way I wanted to play the game. If he gets 1 percent better [Friday] that’s what I want to see.”

The Nets were missing three-fifths of their starting lineup.

Michael Porter Jr. was out with an illness, Terance Mann was out with a right hip contusion, and lottery pick Egor Dëmin had lower back soreness.

“It’s been throughout the games, and obviously me playing him more minutes and making sure that he can continue to play. So, that’s something that popped up, but we believe he’ll be fine soon,” Fernández said. “He’ll be supporting his teammates and ready for the next one.”

As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the upcoming JP Morgan Healthcare conference will be a pivotal indicator on the direction for the biopharma sector for 2026.","Against the backdrop of a turbulent year marked by both breakthrough and setbacks, the biopharmaceutical industry is entering 2026 with renewed confidence. Industry optimism and investment sentiment have strengthened, although cautiously, according to a new report by GlobalData, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.

In 2025, the biopharmaceutical industry began the year with strong scientific and commercial momentum with a high level of optimism with large deals seen around the JP Morgan Healthcare conference, including Johnson & Johnson’s $14.6 billion acquisition of Intra-Cellular Therapies for its neuroscience portfolio, as well as GSK’s $1 billion deal with IDRx, and Eli Lilly acquiring an oncology drug candidate from Scorpion Therapeutics for $2.5 billion.

Hannah Hans, Head of Pharma Strategic Intelligence at GlobalData, comments: “However, industry sentiment quickly turned cautious. Q2 2025 saw the biopharma industry adopt a more guarded stance. Announcements of US drug pricing reforms under the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) policy, tariffs, and trade uncertainties, combined with the looming patent cliffs, and rising costs collectively drove a more cautious outlook.”

Companies recalibrated in response to these pressures, and by Q3, they had adjusted cost structures and clarified development priorities. In addition, several large pharma companies engaged with the Trump administration to reach deals on drug pricing. The sector saw major deals with Pfizer outbidding Novo Nordisk to re-enter the obesity market with Metsera’s clinical-stage GLP-1 receptor agonist and amylin analogs, and Novartis acquiring Avidity to strengthen its neuromuscular disease portfolio. Out-licensing activity continued, highlighted by GSK’s $12.5 billion licensing deal with Jiangsu Hengrui reinforcing the growing strength and global relevance of innovation from China.

In November, the Jefferies Healthcare 2025 conference provided a valuable temperature check on the industry’s appetite for deals. Executives projected confidence about the opportunities and market outlook for 2026, while acknowledging the larger acquisitions Merck and Pfizer completed earlier in the year. They highlighted strong interest in breakthrough, innovative early science and the need for differentiating later-stage companies with promising results. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Biotech Index, reflected the renewed levels of optimism, showcasing its strongest performance since 2014.

Looking ahead at 2026, these sentiments are reiterated, according to GlobalData’s latest report, “The State of the Biopharmaceutical Industry 2026”. As per the report’s survey, 52% of pharmaceutical professionals felt optimistic or very optimistic about the industry’s growth in 2026, which is up by 10% compared to data gathered six months ago.

Additionally, 39% of the surveyed pharmaceutical industry professionals reported being optimistic or very optimistic on the recovery of biotech funding in the next 12 months, an increase by 15% from results seen in May 2025. This reflects a slightly more positive outlook compared to earlier in the year, which could be due to clarity on external factors such as MFN, tariffs, as well an increase in deal activity.

As the industry looks ahead to 2026, the upcoming JP Morgan Healthcare conference will be a pivotal indicator on the direction for the biopharma sector for 2026. The event will set the tone for dealmaking, capital flow and R&D priorities in the year ahead, as executives look to reaffirm investor confidence, aligning on the next wave of scientific and commercial breakthroughs to strengthen pipelines.

Hans concludes: “As we look to 2026, strong drug pipelines and breakthrough clinical catalysts will drive the sector, as pricing pressures are addressed, innovation and differentiation will take centre stage, and strategic deals accelerate growth and portfolio transformation.”

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.
