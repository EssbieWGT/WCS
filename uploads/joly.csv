Driving the Day

TRIPLE THREAT — Insurers face a number of pressures that could lead to a jump in out-of-pocket health costs for Americans: cuts to Medicaid, federal policy changes that could hit Obamacare enrollment and medical costs rising faster than expected, Kelly reports.

Several health insurers were already on unstable financial footing even before President Donald Trump signed into law the “big, beautiful bill” — which could lead to millions of people losing coverage. The looming changes now create more uncertainty that could lead to a downturn for the health insurance industry and a jump in premiums for Americans purchasing coverage.

“You have this perfect storm here of very large changes happening all at once,” said Ellen Montz, a managing director with advisory firm Manatt Health and a former CMS official during the Biden administration. “They’re looking at pricing, what is potentially coming down the pike, and we’re going to see some very large, both gross and net, premium increases.”

Both Centene and Molina Healthcare slashed their yearly financial guidance over the past few weeks amid unexpectedly high medical costs in Medicaid and Obamacare plans. And health insurance giant UnitedHealthcare lowered its guidance in May because of higher-than-anticipated Medicare Advantage costs.

“As we see these cost pressures continue to mount, as we see them go unaddressed and continue to snowball in their effect, the inevitable result is that we will see higher premiums,” said David Merritt, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.

Why it matters: The Congressional Budget Office estimated that an earlier version of the “big, beautiful bill,” combined with the expiration of the enhanced Obamacare subsidies at the end of this year and new Trump administration Affordable Care Act policies that make it more difficult to enroll, could cause nearly 17 million people to become uninsured.

Cushioning the blow: Insurers are pushing Congress and the Trump administration to mitigate some of the fallout, warning lawmakers in competitive districts that their constituents will face widespread coverage disruptions if the policies are implemented. The industry’s most pressing concern is the expiration of the enhanced subsidies — which Congress must extend within the next few months to avoid “very sudden” and “severe” cost hikes and coverage losses nationwide, said Mike Tuffin, the CEO of health insurance trade group AHIP.

So far, few Republican lawmakers have expressed interest in extending the subsidies, which CBO has estimated at $335 billion over 10 years.

“We know over the last 30 years that when people’s coverage is disrupted, their access to health care is disrupted, there’s an immediate political response, and both parties have seen that in the past, and we want to prevent that,” Tuffin said.

What’s next: Insurers will start posting their 2025 second-quarter earnings over the next few weeks, which will provide some insight into how they might adjust to rising medical costs. It may also shed light on how they’re factoring in looming federal changes to their pricing. First up is Elevance Health, which will report its earnings Thursday.

In Congress

AUTISM SPEAKS ON THE HILL — Advocates from the group Autism Speaks will head to the Capitol today to urge lawmakers to fund recently reauthorized research and service programs in the wake of the GOP megabill’s steep Medicaid cuts.

While the group will acknowledge their concerns about how those cuts could impact autism programs in the states, it plans to focus on the annual appropriations process “since that’s the next thing up, and something that we want to try to ensure that we’re at least maintaining the levels of funding for those programs,” David Sitcovsky, Autism Speaks’ vice president of advocacy, told Lauren.

Congress reauthorized the Autism CARES Act in December, which Autism Speaks says is the primary federal funding source for monitoring, research, services and training programs in the autism community. The law’s programs are spread across the CDC, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the NIH.

The group plans to underscore in their meetings that autism is a lifelong condition — not just a childhood disorder, as often emphasized by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — for which many people need support as they age.

“It seems like most [of the] conversation about autism has been framed around childhood, and and I think what were really trying to do … is to remind people that [it’s a] lifelong issue, and there are many adults who need better understanding and supportive services now,” said Dr. Andy Shih, Autism Speaks’ chief science officer.

At the Agencies

DOC PAY OVERHAUL — The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is proposing a boost in funding to doctors who participate in alternative payment models based on the quality of care delivered instead of individual services, POLITICO’s Robert King reports.

“We’re making it easier for seniors to access preventive services, incentivizing health care providers to deliver real results, and cracking down on abuse that drives up costs,” CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement Monday when the agency released its proposed physician fee schedule that details changes to Medicare pay for 2026.

What it means: Doctors participating in the models would receive a 3.83 percent boost to their payments starting in 2026. Doctors not participating in such models would get a 3.62 percent increase.

Why it matters: If finalized, the rule would represent a departure from how CMS traditionally reimburses doctors. The agency typically has one rate update that applies to all doctors serving Medicare patients, regardless of whether they participate in an alternative payment model.

Both Republican and Democratic administrations have sought to shift Medicare reimbursement away from payments for individual items or services.

TECH TROUBLES — The Department of Veterans Affairs told a House panel Monday that it has implemented DOGE-directed cuts to optimize its IT infrastructure. But lawmakers say they want assurances that the agency’s past problems with IT modernization won’t be its future, Ruth reports.

“For years, this committee has highlighted the wasteful spending, the overbudget projects, poor outcomes that seem to come with all IT projects at the VA,” said Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Mich.), chair of the House Veterans Affairs’ Technology Modernization Subcommittee.

Since the beginning of the year, the VA’s Office of Information and Technology has lost 1,100 employees — mostly from buy-out and early retirement offers — and its 2026 budget has shaved $500 million from its operating funding. Subcommittee ranking member Rep. Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.) said she’s concerned the cuts will undermine the agency’s efforts.

Eddie Pool, the VA’s acting assistant secretary and chief information officer, assured lawmakers that more than three-quarters of the people who left the agency were going to retire soon.

Why it matters: Veterans Affairs is in the midst of its latest attempt to update its IT infrastructure, including its electronic medical records system. The agency has been attempting to modernize since 2001 and has failed to do so multiple times, according to the Government Accountability Office.

Carol Harris, the GAO’s director of IT and cybersecurity, testified that the VA’s IT office hasn’t adequately taken stock of its workforce. For example, she said, it doesn’t have an inventory of employees’ current cybersecurity skills and competencies. The agency also hasn’t comprehensively identified its current and future human capital needs, Harris added.

The GAO has 26 open recommendations for improving the VA’s IT and cybersecurity that it said the office still needs to complete.

What’s next: President Donald Trump recently announced his pick for chief information officer at the VA, Ryan Cote, who served as the Transportation Department’s CIO in the first Trump administration. His confirmation hearing hasn’t been scheduled yet.

Health Costs

MEDICAL DEBT RULE TOSSED OUT — A federal judge has overturned a Biden administration rule that would have removed $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million people, POLITICO’s Katherine Hapgood reports.

U.S. District Judge Sean Jordan of the Eastern District Court in Texas said the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule “exceeds the bureau’s statutory authority” and violates the law on permissible purposes of consumer reports. The decision aligns with the Trump administration’s stance on the issue.

The rule was finalized by then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, but the bureau under the Trump administration reversed its position on the rule and joined credit-reporting groups in challenging it. The rule had been set to take effect at the end of July.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another naturally derived food dye on Monday, making good on one of its key promises in the effort to rid the US food system of petroleum-based synthetic dyes.

The FDA approved the natural food color gardenia blue — made from the gardenia plant — for use in sports and fruit drinks, flavored waters, teas and candy. This follows the May approval of three other natural colors , and fulfills an April promise from the agency and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to fast-track authorization of four new natural color additive

In April the FDA announced they would revoke authorization for two food dyes (Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B), and work with industry to eliminate six other synthetic dyes by the end of next year.

“This expedited timeline underscores our serious intent to transition away from petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the food supply,” FDA commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in a statement. “By expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes.”

The FDA also sent a letter Monday to food makers encouraging them to phase-out the synthetic Red Dye No. 3, which is linked to cancer and used in over 2,800 food products, sooner than the current January 15, 2027 required deadline.

“The FDA believes that accelerating the phase out of the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in foods will help further the goal of Making America Healthy Again,” the FDA said in the letter. The popularity of the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement associated with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fueled the recent agency actions.

Public health advocates have called for the elimination of certain synthetic dyes in foods for years, citing scientific research linking consumption of the dyes to disease and to health problems including hyperactivity and behavioral problems in children. The dyes are commonly found in candy, sodas, cereals, sports drinks and other highly processed foods, but also show up in unexpected items like casserole mixes, yogurts and salad dressings.

“This expedited timeline underscores our serious intent to transition away from petroleum-based synthetic dyes in the food supply.” – Dr. Marty Makary, FDA

While the synthetic dye phase out is voluntary, food makers have responded: food giants Kraft Heinz, PepsiCo and General Mills have all committed to phasing out the chemicals. The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that represents a variety of manufacturers including food and drink makers, announced last week that it would encourage its food and beverage manufacturers to remove synthetic dyes from products served in US schools by the start of the 2026-2027 school year.

“While these safe ingredients are supported by scientific evidence and a longstanding history of approval by the FDA, the industry recognizes preferences are evolving and is innovating to meet families where they are,” Melissa Hockstad, president & CEO of Consumer Brands, said in a statement.

Recent research suggests the changes could have a massive impact: nearly 20% of packaged foods and drinks in the US have synthetic dyes, with most marketed to children and loaded with sugar, according to a June study that examined nearly 40,000 items from popular food brands. However, scientists say the FDA’s acute focus on synthetic dyes ignores myriad other potentially harmful chemicals in foods and food packaging.",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shayna-douglas-7r5jMqhgg00-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 10:11:59.064463

“The plastic pieces are transparent, may have sharp edges, and could present a risk to consumers because some pieces are between 7 and 25 mm in length,” reads the alert. “The company is working swiftly with retail partners to remove the impacted product from shelves, while it works to address the issue and bring back the YoCrunch® products so many people enjoy.”

Impacted product names and code dates, as provided by the FDA, are below.

Consumers who have purchased the affected products are urged not to eat them.

“Danone U.S., the makers of YoCrunch, takes every consumer experience seriously and is initiating this voluntary recall in line with its commitment to product quality and consumer safety,” reads the recall alert.

The South African unit of the world number two steelmaker said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

""Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,"" ArcelorMittal SA said in a trading update.

It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

Trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 government was in ""firefighting mode"" as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal's operations in KwaZulu-Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors and components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected R1.683bn in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service ""deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk"", the steelmaker said.

ArcelorMittal SA expects to report a headline loss per share between 89c 99c for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from R1 per share during the same period last year.

“We're improving the clinical availability of mission critical assets around US healthcare every day,” Settimi said during a recent interview.
Under his leadership, the company launched a single enterprise platform that consolidates vendor management, service coordination, and performance benchmarking across systems.
These tools help hospitals select vendors, monitor performance, and optimize supply chain preferences through formulary management, akin to the way pharmacy benefit managers operate.
And he’s betting that better data and smarter supply chains are what will keep healthcare ""always on.""","Philip Settimi doesn’t run a hospital, but he thinks like someone who does. As CEO of PartsSource, a healthcare technology company serving over 5,000 hospitals across the US, Settimi brings a supply chain mindset to one of the most overlooked drivers of clinical performance: asset uptime.

“We're improving the clinical availability of mission critical assets around US healthcare every day,” Settimi said during a recent interview. He noted that the company “started as an e-commerce and distribution platform for parts” but that mission has since evolved.

Since joining PartsSource in 2014—after leading roles at GE Healthcare IT, Hospira, and Hill-Rom—Settimi has transformed the company from a parts supplier into a digital health infrastructure provider. Under his leadership, the company launched a single enterprise platform that consolidates vendor management, service coordination, and performance benchmarking across systems. Health systems like Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, and Providence are now enterprise clients using PartsSource Pro, which Settimi says brings cost, quality, and productivity improvements at scale.

His strategy is to digitize and simplify the complex vendor environment in hospitals. “An average hospital is managing 150 service contracts. 75% percent of those are relatively low dollar and long tail... offline and analog,” Settimi explained. Hospitals, he noted, are left tracking down field service reports manually and often lack performance metrics on vendors.

To address this, PartsSource has built decision-support tools that sit on top of over “three billion data points” collected over two decades. These tools help hospitals select vendors, monitor performance, and optimize supply chain preferences through formulary management, akin to the way pharmacy benefit managers operate.

“Every transaction is tracked from a performance perspective,” he said, allowing clients to benchmark against national peers.

Settimi’s long-term vision draws on his operational experience across industries. At GE and Hospira, he worked on device/software integration and medical supply chains. At PartsSource, he’s applying that knowledge to HTM (healthcare technology management), a field he believes is key to fixing healthcare’s broader cost and efficiency problem. “We believe HTM has a key role in that mission, not just at the table but leading the way,” he highlighted.

For Settimi, the operating room starts with operations. And he’s betting that better data and smarter supply chains are what will keep healthcare ""always on.""",https://thehealthcaretechnologyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Philip-Settimi.png,N,,2025-07-15 09:03:38.626301

It employs about 360,000 people worldwide, including 5,600 in the UK, most of whom work in its cafes.
Niccol faced environmental criticism last year for his 1,000-mile commute to work in the office three days a week.
The company allowed him to travel in from his home in Newport Beach, California, to its head office in Seattle via a private jet instead of relocating.","Starbucks has ordered its corporate staff to work from the office at least four days a week from late September and is offering cash payments to those who choose to quit instead.

Brian Niccol, the chief executive of the Seattle-headquartered coffee chain, said many of its employees would be required to work in the office for a minimum of four days a week, up from three, from Monday to Thursday. This will apply to its Seattle and Toronto support centres and regional offices in North America.

“We do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a message to employees, referred to as “partners”, on the company’s website on “re-establishing an in-office culture”. “We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams.”

He added: “Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

The four-day office policy will come into effect on 29 September. Niccol, who has been in the job for almost a year, has said he wants to take Starbucks back to its coffeehouse roots by improving customers’ experience in its cafes and reducing reliance on mobile and takeaway orders.

He said: “We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.

“To support those who decide to ‘opt out’, we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit programme with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.” The company did not state the size of the sum.

In February, the company asked its vice-presidents who were working remotely to move to Seattle or Toronto. It is now extending this requirement to all support centre “people leaders”, who are expected to relocate within 12 months.

In its previous announcement, Starbucks set out plans to lay off 1,100 corporate employees and close several hundred open or vacant job positions, the biggest job cuts in its history, in order to reduce costs as it struggled with rising inflation and economic uncertainty.

In response to the Government’s June 2025 Spending Review, a quarter (27 per cent) expect their energy bills to go up, and a fifth (19 per cent) anticipate their essential spending will increase. Separately, three quarters (76 per cent) are concerned about the impact of ongoing geo-political instability on their household finances.

Furniture stores shine

Despite a slower month for retail, furniture stores enjoyed a particularly strong June, up 8.2 per cent – the category’s highest increase since March 2022. This is potentially due to new homeowners furnishing their new properties; record numbers of mortgage completions took place in March 2025, particularly among first-time buyers, where completions jumped 70 per cent compared to February, ahead of April’s stamp duty changes.

Pharmacy, health & beauty also bucked the overall retail trend, up 10.1 per cent likely in part due to the purchase of seasonal staples such as hay fever medication, suncream and everyday cosmetics; three in 10 (28 per cent) shoppers reported spending more on suncream in June, with 18 per cent upping spending on hay fever medication.

Summer blockbusters provide cinemas with seasonal boost

The overall hospitality and leisure sector grew 2.1 per cent year-on-year, led by the strong performance of entertainment, up 8.0 per cent. Live shows & concerts grew 2.5 per cent, as one in five (18 per cent) UK adults said they would be spending money to attend summer concerts and events such as Beyonce, Dua Lipa and Pitbull, at an average of £160.80 in total each.

Cinema spend increased 26.9 per cent, owing to highly anticipated blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning and How to Train Your Dragon. With a summer of sport well under way, the small screen also fared well. Digital content & subscriptions saw growth of 7.0 per cent, helped by subscription-only sports viewing of Formula 1 and the British & Irish Lions rugby tour.

Karen Johnson, Head of Retail at Barclays, said: “Despite the warm weather, which usually boosts non-essential sectors such as retail and hospitality, consumers spent cautiously in June, prioritising value as they navigate economic uncertainty. Encouragingly, entertainment, beauty and furniture stores bucked the trend, while confidence in household finances improved, showing consumers’ willingness to spend on the things that matter most to them.”

Jack Meaning, Chief UK Economist at Barclays, said: “The economy has cooled throughout through Q2, but our data does show pockets of strength. However, with both global and domestic uncertainty, and temporarily heightened inflation likely to continue, consumers are remaining cautious and maintaining savings buffers. We expect this to lead to limited GDP growth for the remainder of this year, before falling interest rates and a stronger sense of certainty drive a return to growth next year.”

Notes to Editors

Across its issuing and acquiring businesses, Barclays sees nearly 40 per cent of the nation’s credit and debit card transactions, which provides us with unique insight into UK consumer spending. Unless stated otherwise, this press release is based on consumer card spending data from Barclays’ issuing business – i.e. Barclays debit card and Barclaycard credit card transactions. It relates to the period 24th May 2025 – 27th June 2025 vs 25th May 2024 – 28th June 2024.

The Barclays Consumer Spend research in this press release was carried out between 27th June – 2nd July 2025 by Opinium Research on behalf of Barclays. There were 2,000 respondents in each round of research, providing a representative sample of UK consumers by age, gender, region, and income group. Barclays has been tracking consumer confidence since December 2015. The net confidence measures have been calculated by adding together the responses of those said they were feeling “fairly confident” or “very confident”.

The snapshot from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed total sales grew by 3.1% year on year in June, after a sharp drop in May, as record-breaking temperatures and promotional offers encouraged consumers to spend.

Official figures showed UK retail sales collapsed by 2.7% in May, the sharpest monthly decline in almost two years, in a “dismal” month for supermarkets as the economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1%.

However, the BRC said June’s high temperatures helped to “heat up” consumer spending. The total value of food sales rose by 4.1% year on year, although this partly reflected fast-rising food prices pushing up the cost of a supermarket shopping basket.

Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “The soaring temperatures increased sales of electric fans while sports and leisure equipment was boosted by the weather and the start of Wimbledon.

“Food sales remained strong, though this was in part driven by food inflation, which has risen steadily over the course of the year.”

Households have come under pressure from lingering high inflation, adding to already elevated living costs, after tax rises and increases in bills. Consumer confidence has also been hit by uncertainty over sluggish growth, a cooling UK jobs market and Donald Trump’s trade wars.

Separate figures from Barclays showed consumer card spending – which takes into account broader spending on hospitality and leisure alongside retail – fell 0.1% year on year in June.

Highlighting evidence of consumer caution, it said essential spending – including food and fuel – fell 2.1%.

However, the bank, which processes almost 40% of UK credit and debit card transactions, said there were signs of rising consumer confidence and willingness to spend on experiences.

The onset of summer festivals, weddings and sporting events contributed to a marginal 0.8% increase in non-essential spending, led by the strong performance of entertainment and health and beauty. Hospitality and leisure spending grew 2.1%, helped by live shows from Beyoncé and Pitbull, and huge outdoor concerts in Hyde Park.

Spending on furniture rose sharply, reflecting new homeowners furnishing their properties after a rush to complete purchases before the expiry of a temporary cut in stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland at the end of March.

A survey of 2,000 adults by Barclays showed confidence in household finances improved by six percentage points to 73% – a four-month high.

Jack Meaning, the chief UK economist at Barclays, said: “The economy has cooled throughout through [the second quarter], but our data does show pockets of strength.

ArcelorMittal South Africa has issued a stark update regarding its Long Steel division, warning that the business faces an uncertain future as its financial lifeline nears exhaustion. The R1.683 billion facility provided by the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) has now been fully utilized, leaving the company at a critical juncture.

Unless significant structural and financial interventions are implemented by September 30, 2025, ArcelorMittal may proceed with an orderly wind-down of its Long Steel operations. Despite these challenges, the company has committed to continuing operations through the third quarter of 2025 to honor existing customer commitments.

The potential closure represents a significant shift in South Africa's steel industry landscape, with downstream implications for construction, infrastructure development, and manufacturing sectors that rely on domestically produced long steel products.

""The Long Steel division's continued viability hinges on addressing fundamental market and operational challenges that have persistently undermined its competitiveness,"" notes the company in its latest trading update.

Structural Market Constraints Plaguing the Long Steel Division

Several entrenched market dynamics have contributed to the division's precarious position. Chief among these is the difficulty in securing competitively priced scrap metal, a critical raw material for long steel production. The pricing structure for scrap metal in South Africa has disadvantaged domestic steel producers compared to international competitors.

This challenge is compounded by persistently weak demand for long steel products in the South African market. Construction activity, a primary consumer of long steel products such as rebar and structural sections, has remained subdued due to broader economic conditions and delays in infrastructure projects.

The division also continues to face intense competition from imported steel products flooding the local market. Despite various steel tariff exemptions for some countries, the tariff protection framework has proven insufficient to create a level playing field for domestic producers. These imports often arrive at prices that domestic manufacturers struggle to match due to their higher operational costs.

Operational Obstacles Creating Unsustainable Cost Pressures

Beyond market constraints, ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division grapples with severe operational challenges that have significantly increased its cost base:

Rail service deterioration: Transnet's rail service has reached unprecedented poor levels, severely affecting the company's logistics capabilities

Infrastructure failures: Persistent cable theft and locomotive breakdowns have disrupted supply chains

Logistics cost burden: Additional logistics expenses amounting to R317 million have been incurred due to transportation challenges

Energy cost disadvantage: Electricity expenses significantly higher than international competitors, undermining global competitiveness

The rail service challenges are particularly damaging, as they affect both incoming raw materials and outgoing finished products. Despite some rail service improvements in other regions, the company has been forced to utilize more expensive road transportation alternatives, resulting in the R317 million in additional logistics costs that have directly impacted the division's bottom line.

How Has the Six-Month Deferral Period Performed?

In March 2025, ArcelorMittal South Africa announced a six-month extension for its Long Steel division, aimed at exploring sustainable solutions while maintaining operations. This period was supported by the R1.683 billion facility from the IDC, providing a temporary financial cushion.

However, the company has now reported that minimal progress has been achieved in addressing the core challenges facing the division. The fundamental market constraints and operational obstacles remain largely unchanged, calling into question the division's long-term viability.

""Despite concerted efforts to identify sustainable solutions, the structural challenges facing the Long Steel division have proven resistant to short-term interventions,"" states the company's latest update.

Given the limited progress, ArcelorMittal has indicated that it might initiate wind-down preparations before the September 30 deadline if the outlook doesn't improve. This proactive approach aims to ensure an orderly transition that minimizes disruption to customers and stakeholders.

Business Continuity Through the Transition Period

Despite the uncertain future, ArcelorMittal has emphasized its commitment to honoring existing customer orders through the third quarter of 2025. This approach aims to provide customers with adequate time to secure alternative supply arrangements and minimize disruption to their operations.

The company plans to release its full interim financial results on July 31, 2025, which will provide more comprehensive details about the division's performance and future prospects. According to recent warnings from AMSA, approximately 3,500 jobs could be at risk if the Long Steel division were to close, highlighting the significant social impact of such a decision.

What is ArcelorMittal South Africa's Current Financial Position?

While the Long Steel division faces an uncertain future, ArcelorMittal South Africa's overall financial performance shows some signs of improvement, albeit while remaining in loss-making territory.

Trading Statement Highlights

According to the company's trading statement, interim loss per share is expected to improve by 15-25% year-on-year. Current projections indicate a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 per share, compared to the R1.09 per share loss reported in the corresponding period of 2024.

Similarly, headline loss per share is forecast to be between R0.89 and R0.99, an improvement from the R1.00 per share headline loss recorded in the first half of 2024. These figures suggest that while the company continues to face challenges, there has been some moderation in its financial difficulties.

The company will release its unaudited results on the JSE's Stock Exchange News Service (SENS) by the end of July, providing investors and stakeholders with a more comprehensive picture of its financial health.

Operational Performance Metrics

On the operational front, ArcelorMittal South Africa has reported several notable developments:

Safety improvements: The lost-time injury frequency rate has been reduced significantly to 0.44, down from 1.13 in the first half of 2024, reflecting enhanced workplace safety protocols

Flat Steel production gains: Double-digit increases in production volumes following the restoration of Blast Furnace C, demonstrating operational improvements in this segment

Sales volume challenges: Approximately 10% year-on-year reduction in overall sales volumes, primarily attributed to weaker market demand

Price pressure persistence: Realized prices in rand terms more than 5% lower than in 2024, reflecting continued competitive pressures in the market

The improved safety performance stands out as a positive achievement amid the company's broader challenges, highlighting effective implementation of safety protocols and procedures.

How Does This Situation Compare to Previous Steel Industry Challenges?

The current challenges facing ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division reflect broader historical patterns in the global steel industry, which has long been characterized by cyclical boom and bust periods. However, several factors make the present situation particularly challenging.

Historical Context of Steel Industry Restructuring

The global steel industry has undergone significant restructuring over the past several decades, with consolidation and capacity rationalization becoming common responses to market overcapacity and pricing pressures. Many mature steel markets, including those in Europe and North America, have previously faced similar decisions regarding legacy steel assets.

South Africa's manufacturing sector has faced persistent pressures from infrastructure challenges, energy constraints, and global competition. The Trump tariffs impact on the global steel industry has further complicated the situation, creating additional market distortions. The country's steel industry has attempted various restructuring efforts in the past, but the current combination of challenges appears particularly severe.

Comparative Analysis with Other Steel Producers

Regional competitiveness factors significantly influence steel producers' viability. South African operations face unique challenges compared to their regional and global peers, including higher energy costs, logistics constraints, and limited domestic market size.

Global steel market dynamics continue to be shaped by significant capacity additions in countries like China, creating persistent pricing pressures across international markets. Ongoing US–China trade tensions have further disrupted global trade flows, affecting markets worldwide. This global context makes it increasingly difficult for higher-cost producers to remain competitive without specialized product offerings or protected markets.

What Are the Potential Outcomes for the Long Steel Division?

As the September 30, 2025 deadline approaches, several potential scenarios could unfold for ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division.

Scenario Analysis

A complete wind-down remains the most likely outcome if significant interventions are not implemented by the deadline. This would involve the systematic closure of facilities and cessation of operations in an orderly manner.

Partial restructuring options might also be considered, potentially maintaining operations at the most efficient facilities while closing others. This approach could preserve some capacity and jobs while reducing the overall cost base.

The possibility of a strategic buyer emerging remains, though industry conditions make this challenging. A buyer with complementary operations or specialized market focus might see value in specific assets.

Government intervention could also play a role, given the strategic importance of steel production to South Africa's industrial base and the significant employment implications. Australia's tariff counterplan for similar situations may provide instructive lessons, though fiscal constraints may limit the scope of potential support measures.

Impact Assessment

The closure of ArcelorMittal's Long Steel division would have significant implications for South Africa's steel supply chain. Downstream industries and customers would need to secure alternative supply sources, potentially leading to increased reliance on imports.

The employment consequences would be substantial, with approximately 3,500 direct jobs at risk, not counting the indirect employment effects on suppliers and service providers.

The resulting market gap would likely be filled by imports and potentially by other domestic producers if they can expand capacity. However, this transition could lead to short-term supply disruptions and price volatility.

The broader economic ripple effects would extend beyond the steel industry, affecting communities where ArcelorMittal's facilities are located and potentially further weakening South Africa's manufacturing base.

FAQ: ArcelorMittal's Long Steel Division Situation

What is the difference between ArcelorMittal's Flat Steel and Long Steel businesses?

Flat steel products include sheets and plates used in automotive manufacturing, appliances, and construction, while long steel products encompass bars, rods, rails, and structural sections primarily used in construction and infrastructure projects. The Flat Steel division has shown better performance, with production increases following the restoration of Blast Furnace C, while the Long Steel division faces more severe challenges.

How significant is the Long Steel Division to ArcelorMittal South Africa's overall operations?

The Long Steel Division represents a substantial portion of ArcelorMittal South Africa's business, with significant production capacity and workforce. Its potential closure would mark a major restructuring of the company's operations in South Africa, affecting approximately 3,500 jobs and reshaping the domestic steel market landscape.

What external factors are contributing to the division's challenges?

External factors include global steel overcapacity creating pricing pressures, economic slowdown affecting construction activity and steel demand, infrastructure challenges in South Africa (particularly rail transportation), electricity supply issues and cost, and logistical constraints. Transnet's deteriorating rail service has directly resulted in R317 million in additional logistics costs for the company.

What alternatives might exist to complete closure?

Alternatives could include partial operation of more efficient facilities, strategic partnerships with other industry players, government support programs, or restructuring to focus on higher-margin specialty products. However, the company has indicated that minimal progress has been made in identifying sustainable alternatives during the six-month deferral period, suggesting limited viable options remain.

""The structural challenges facing South Africa's steel industry require coordinated action from multiple stakeholders, including government, infrastructure providers, and the private sector,"" industry analysts note.

Ndlangiso, on behalf of his company, bought a car from BMW and then seemingly defaulted on the payments, causing the car maker’s financial services unit to go after him and repose the car.

However, BMW filed some of its paperwork to repossess the car eight months late, after the initial court matter to get summary judgement against Ndlangiso started, which it said was because it couldn’t get the relevant person to sign the document because the deponent was “based in another province, causing a logistical delay.

“The explanation is that the affidavit had been timeously commissioned in Gauteng, but delays arose due to the deponent’s availability and physical transmission to KwaZulu-Natal for filing,” the ruling said.

The judge found that BMW’s delay was reasonably explained, and the time frame was “minimal”. “Importantly, the application was electronically served within time,” the court noted.

However, where the judge took umbrage with the matter was that BMW’s late filing could only be condoned if it had a reasonable chance of success in repossessing the car, which it didn’t.

The court noted that the arrears had already been paid by the time BMW applied for summary judgment, and that the company had continued to accept monthly instalments. On this basis, the judge found that BMW had effectively affirmed the agreement.

“Against this backdrop, I find that BMW’s insistence on return of the vehicle despite having received the arrears is neither equitable nor in the public interest,” the court said in its ruling.

The judge added: “Enforcement in such circumstances serves no purpose other than to punish the consumer and is entirely at odds with the rehabilitative and equitable principles that underpin both the NCA [National Consumer Act] and public policy.”

The court dismissed the summary judgment application and granted Ndlangisa Funeral Services and Ndlangiso leave to defend the application to have the car repossessed.

ID23,Kraft Heinz,2025-07-15 10:12:35+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Editorial: Alarm bells are ringing for Chicago in Kraft Heinz's decision to split in two,The Editorial Board,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/15/editorial-kraft-heinz-corporate-headquarters-kellogg-chicago/,"Chicago, longtime home to Kraft Foods, was the winner in that mashup, serving as the headquarters city rather than Heinz’s home of Pittsburgh.
It’s not a stretch to foresee a similar fate befalling Kraft Heinz, post-spinoff.
Kraft Heinz as of 2023 employed more than 3,300 in Illinois, including at the Chicago headquarters and a research and development operation in north suburban Glenview.
The Tribune recognized Kraft Heinz as one of the area’s top workplaces in that year.
JB Pritzker that Kraft Heinz is taking this understandable step to improve shareholder value.","At the dawn of this century, Mayor Richard M. Daley knew he had a problem. Too many Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Chicago had been sold to out-of-town rivals. In the late 1990s into 2000, longtime local corporate titans like Amoco, Ameritech, Quaker Oats and Waste Management were gobbled in the merger mania that pervaded.

Chicago always seemed to come out on the losing end of the dealmaking frenzy. Back then, the circumstances of the various corporate losses weren’t generally tied to the health, fiscal or otherwise, of the city itself, but collectively the deals gave Chicago the image of a city in decline.

So when Boeing delivered the shocking news in 2001 that it was leaving its longtime home of Seattle, launching a nationwide beauty contest to land the corporate headquarters, Daley was all in. More than $60 million in taxpayer subsidies later, Chicago won the prize.

The victory, while a boost to the city’s self-confidence at the time, proved short-lived. Boeing dumped Chicago for the Washington, D.C., area in 2022.

Fast-forward to the present and Chicago again is suffering the loss or diminishment of locally based corporations via dealmaking and (more worryingly) executives and boards simply moving their bases to more business-friendly cities.

That’s why the seemingly innocuous news, broken Friday by The Wall Street Journal, that Chicago-based Kraft Heinz plans to split in two is quite likely to be a negative for Chicago. The packaged-foods giant itself is the product of a merger of two well-known brand names — Kraft and Heinz — in 2015. Chicago, longtime home to Kraft Foods, was the winner in that mashup, serving as the headquarters city rather than Heinz’s home of Pittsburgh. The company owns lots of household brand names and products, like Heinz ketchup, Kraft macaroni and cheese, Kool-Aid, Oscar Mayer, Jell-O and Maxwell House.

Some of those products are growing, and some are struggling. Kraft Heinz management, confronting pressure to do something about a stock price that’s plateaued after losing much of its value years ago, wants to stash the slower-growing brands in one company and the higher-performing brands in another. It’s a textbook Wall Street maneuver to “unlock the value” of stronger businesses housed within sprawling corporations.

If history (and very recent history at that) is a guide, one or both of the Kraft Heinz units following the corporate breakup will be takeover targets. That makes the odds better than even that Chicago ultimately will lose another corporate headquarters once the dominoes fall.

Consider the recent experience of another familiar name: Kellogg. Founded in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1876, the company known best for its breakfast cereals spun off its snacks business into a separate publicly traded company based in Chicago in 2023. That seemed like a bit of a coup for Chicago (especially given the surfeit of bad news at the time such as the departure of Caterpillar to Texas and Ken Griffin’s Citadel empire to Miami). But Chicago proved but a rest stop on the road to a sale.

Just a year later, Kellanova, as the Chicago unit was named, agreed to be acquired by McLean, Virginia-based Mars. The cereals maker, still named Kellogg and based in Battle Creek, agreed just last week to sell to Ferrero Rocher, based in Italy.

Kellogg shareholders are positioned to do well through the strategy. Chicago? Mars says its global snacks president, already based in Chicago, will oversee Kellanova’s snacks business and continue to be based here following closure of the deal, which has yet to take place due to a rigorous antitrust review in the European Union. But no doubt there will be positions cut because of corporate overlap.

We’ll see how Battle Creek fares after the Kellogg deal is completed.

It’s not a stretch to foresee a similar fate befalling Kraft Heinz, post-spinoff. Transforming large conglomerates into more affordable and digestible takeover targets is an essential part of the spinoff strategy.

Kraft Heinz as of 2023 employed more than 3,300 in Illinois, including at the Chicago headquarters and a research and development operation in north suburban Glenview. The Tribune recognized Kraft Heinz as one of the area’s top workplaces in that year.

It’s not the fault of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson or Gov. JB Pritzker that Kraft Heinz is taking this understandable step to improve shareholder value.

But what Illinois and — to a greater extent — Chicago aren’t doing well enough is establishing and nurturing a business environment that makes Chicago an attractive place to locate a business, be it an existing corporation or a startup. So when companies like Kraft Heinz take steps that could result in a business loss for us but otherwise have nothing to do with Chicago as a business destination, we can point to other examples where Chicago turned out the winner.

Today the narrative about Chicago’s business environment focuses overwhelmingly on holding onto what we have rather than adding more “top workplaces.” That needs to change.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CTC-L-CT-ct-biz-top-workplaces-kraft-heinz-profile008_176399677.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-07-15 08:01:08.169838

The appointment is one of the most important components of Mango’s ambitious 4E Strategic Plan, with a focus on professionalising executives and bringing the company into line with best international practices.

Brand’s CEO and chairman, Toni Ruiz said that Helena’s unmatched experience, international viewpoint, and forward-thinking leadership will be a perfect fit for Mango. He added that her vision will be incredibly valuable as they continue to grow and drive the business globally.

Helmersson, who led H&M as CEO from 2020 to 2024, brings over two decades of international experience in fashion, with expertise spanning sustainability, global operations, and supply chain management. She currently chairs the board of textile innovation company Circulose and also holds board positions at Swiss-based On Holding AG and Swedish impact-tech firm Quizrr.

Touting excitement about the new role, Helmersson stated that she’s excited to be part of Mango at this vibrant moment in its history. She added that the vision for expansion, innovation in the products, and leadership in sustainability is compelling, and she is looking forward to making her contributions towards its ongoing development.

Her hiring follows a wider leadership overhaul at Mango. Over the past few weeks, the retailer promoted Eva Gallego to lead its women’s unit, after the departure of veteran executive Elena Carasso. The creation of Gallego’s new position is viewed by some as key to reinforcing Mango’s foundation product line. On the men’s side, change also came, with Josep Estol replacing Jonathan Andic, who left to concentrate on family business ventures.

Mango’s new board now consists of chairman and CEO Toni Ruiz, vice chairman Jonathan Andic, and executive directors Margarita Salvans and Daniel López. Independent directors are Helmersson, Jordi Canals, Jorge Lucaya, Jordi Constans, Marc Puig, and Manel Adell, with Eugenia Jover as board secretary.

Started in 1984 by Isak Andic, Mango has expanded to have over 120 markets with more than 2,800 stores across the world. In 2024, it posted revenues of US $3.90 billion, increasing 7.6% year on year. Its 2024–2026 roadmap is to achieve revenue of US $ 4.67 billion and 500 new store openings by the end of the cycle.",https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mango-appoints-ex-HM-CEO-Helena-Helmersson.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 08:00:55.360614

Therefore, we appreciate and warmly appreciate Danone Indonesia's support and collaboration in providing infrastructure and clean water access facilities.
For more than two decades, Danone Indonesia has presented access to clean water to villages in NTT.
We believe the availability of access to clean water and drinking water is closely related to the health and quality of life of the community.
Realizing the limited resources of the community to process clean water into safe drinking water, Danone Indonesia also collaborated with NAZAVA to distribute a total of 1,500 safe drinking water filters (water filters) to various regions in NTT.","JAKARTA - Drinking water and sanitation are one of the main priorities in sustainable development goals in Indonesia. In line with the commitment to bring health to as many Indonesians as possible, Danone Indonesia in collaboration with the Provincial Government of East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), Kupang Regency and South Central Timor Regency along with partners of the Community Care Network Foundation (JPM), the Muhammadiyah Community Empowerment Council (MPM), Nazava and Mitra Dhuafa Cooperatives (Komida) today inaugurated clean water facilities and handed over safe drinking water facilities at SD GMIT Oenaek, Kupang, NTT.

The inauguration was also attended by Retno Marsudi, the Special Envoy for the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN) for Water Affairs; and Gita Sabharwal - UN Resident Coordinator for Indonesia.

The inauguration of clean water facilities in the villages of Oenaek and Sumlili, Kupang Regency, was carried out as part of efforts to prevent stunting in NTT which had started in 2020. To ensure that people have access to safe drinking water both at the household level and when doing activities in public facilities, Danone Indonesia also handed over safe drinking water facilities in the form of Nazava water sievery for people in Kupang Regency and South Central Timor (TTS).

Retno Marsudi, Special Envoy for the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) for Water, explained that access to drinking water is still an urgent challenge at the global and national levels.

""BP data shows that 1 in 4 people do not have access to clean water, and every day 1,000 children under 5 years die from this limitation, with the death rate due to diarrhea 3 times higher than violence. In Indonesia alone, access to clean water is also one of the challenges we face. In responding to this challenge, collaboration between the government and all parties, including the private sector, plays an important role. Therefore, we appreciate and warmly appreciate Danone Indonesia's support and collaboration in providing infrastructure and clean water access facilities. Hopefully, this synergy can be stronger to overcome water issues in various regions in Indonesia,"" he explained, in a written statement,

The Governor of NTT, represented by the Head of the NTT Provincial Health Office, drg. Iin Anggraeni, also appreciated this collaboration.

For more than two decades, Danone Indonesia has presented access to clean water to villages in NTT. Danone Indonesia has not stopped and continues to contribute through stunting prevention programs that include education, training, providing access to nutrients, to the establishment of the Village Stunting Monitoring Team. Until now, this program has reached around 20 villages in Kupang and has begun to expand to other regions in NTT. We hope that people who are scattered in various regions in NTT can feel the impact, and live a healthier life.

We believe the availability of access to clean water and drinking water is closely related to the health and quality of life of the community. As part of our commitment to Danone Impact Journey to create health impacts through hydration and nutrition as well as support the efforts of the Indonesian government and SDGs in achieving the target of access to drinking water is feasible and safe; we hope that by inaugurating clean water facilities and handing over safe drinking water facilities in the form of water filters, it can encourage a reduction in stunting rates, and improve the health of the people of NTT, in particular, in areas that have limited access,"" said Vera.

Galuh Sugijanto, VP General Secretary of Danone Indonesia. Data from the 2022 Indonesian Nutrition Status Survey (SSGI) recorded NTT as the province with the highest stunting prevalence rate of 35.3 percent. Therefore, supporting efforts to reduce and handle stunting prevalence in NTT, Danone Indonesia has been running stunting prevention programs since 2020.

This initiative has reached more than 79 thousand beneficiaries through educational activities as well as the provision of access to nutrition, clean water and sanitation, as well as contributing to the reduction and handling of stunting prevalence in Kupang Regency, which previously in 2020 was at 22.3 percent to 12 percent in 2024. The availability of clean water and sanitation can reduce the risk of infection such as repeated diarrhea which can inhibit nutrition absorption and cause stunting.

In an effort to improve this clean water access facility, Danone Indonesia has built clean water facilities in five villages in Kupang and Southwest Sumba Regencies, of which two were inaugurated today by Danone Indonesia to the beneficiary community, witnessed by the Special Envoy for the Secretary General of the United Nations (UN) for Water, the Head of the Permanent UN Representative in Indonesia, the Governor of NTT Province and the Regent of Kupang.

Realizing the limited resources of the community to process clean water into safe drinking water, Danone Indonesia also collaborated with NAZAVA to distribute a total of 1,500 safe drinking water filters (water filters) to various regions in NTT.

Partnering with MPM Muhammadiyah and the Community Care Network Foundation (JPM), Danone Indonesia handed over 500 units directly to the people in Kupang Regency and TTS; and developed an ecosystem for subsidized water filter marketing which was allocated 1,000 units in the early stages, by cooperating with the Mitra Dhuafa Cooperative (KOMIDA) through a credit mechanism.",https://imgsrv2.voi.id/Oe7kEWq23hMCTWC2ujTzo-9g5cUTZ25KJxiR_H2yJrY/rs:fill/w:800/h:450/g:sm/wm:1:nowe:0:0:1/bG9jYWw6Ly8vcHVibGlzaGVycy80OTU0NTgvMjAyNTA3MTUxNjM4LW1haW4uY3JvcHBlZF8xNzUyNTcyMzQ3LkpQRw.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 07:04:32.841662

“As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure™ technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal.
The Medtronic Hugo™ RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies.
In the EU, the Hugo™ RAS system is CE marked.
In the U.S., the Hugo™ RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.","Medtronic plc, a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced it has received CE Mark for the LigaSure™ RAS vessel-sealing technology, expanding Hugo™ robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) system capabilities for gynecologic, general, and urologic procedures in Europe.

As the first-ever robotic-driven LigaSure™ instrument, this milestone represents the beginning of a new era for the vessel-sealing technology that has been used in more than 35 million procedures across 65+ countries over the last two decades.

“Today, with CE Mark for LigaSure™ RAS, Medtronic is fulfilling a promise to customers to integrate our trusted vessel-sealing technology onto the Hugo™ RAS system,” said Matt Anderson, senior vice president and president of the Surgical business, which is part of the Medical Surgical Portfolio at Medtronic. “More than fulfilling a commitment, this regulatory approval is a big step forward as we continue to shape the future of surgery with surgical teams who share our passion and commitment to deliver the best possible care to every patient.”

Dr. Miguel Caceres of Pacifica Salud Hospital in Panama was one of the first surgeons in the world to use LigaSure™ RAS with the Hugo™ RAS system.

“LigaSure™ technology is one of the most important advances for minimally invasive surgery because it provides sealing and cutting in a way that is very, very secure for the performance of the surgeon and the security of the patient,” said Dr. Caceres. “As a robotic surgeon, we want LigaSure™ technology because it gives us confidence in the security of the seal. We are already seeing the benefits in our cases with the Hugo™ RAS system.”

Powered by the Valleylab™ FT10 energy platform and for use exclusively with the Hugo™ RAS system, the LigaSure™ RAS Maryland instrument is indicated for sealing and cutting vessels, thick tissue, and lymphatics up to and including 7 mm in diameter. The device reliably seals vessels in approximately 2 seconds while minimizing thermal spread to surrounding tissue.

This week at SRS: LigaSure™ RAS initial experience, Hugo™ GYN data and telesurgery demo

Dr. Caceres, who has been using the Hugo™ RAS system four years, will discuss his initial experience with LigaSure™ RAS during a Medtronic-sponsored symposium at the Society of Robotic Surgery (SRS) 2025 Annual Meeting, July 16-20 in Strasbourg, France.

SRS also includes a presentation on preliminary outcomes of hysterectomy for benign gynecologic conditions — a Medtronic-sponsored study of 112 Hugo™ RAS procedures across eight sites in Europe and Asia. Dr. Francesco Fanfani, associate professor at Agostino Gemelli University Polyclinic, will present the data.

Looking ahead to the next frontier of surgery, Medtronic will demo telesurgery capabilities on the Hugo™ RAS system from the nearby IRCAD facility — one of its strategic training partners. The demo will be followed by a panel discussion, including authors of Technical Guidelines for Remote Robotic-Assisted Surgery, which was recently published in the Journal of World Surgery.

The paper is a foundational piece to support safe and scalable telesurgery, reinforcing Medtronic’s commitment to innovation powered by human connection.

These announcements come amid growing momentum for the Hugo™ RAS system, which is now in use across 30+ countries on five continents, with over 270 independent publications supporting its clinical use across urology, gynecology, and general surgery procedures.

In the U.S., the company’s submission for a urology indication is under review by the Food and Drug Administration, with an expected U.S. entrance later in the company’s current fiscal year, followed by planned indication expansions into hernia and gynecology.

The Medtronic Hugo™ RAS system is commercially available in certain geographies. Regulatory requirements of individual countries and regions will determine approval, clearance, or market availability. In the EU, the Hugo™ RAS system is CE marked. In the U.S., the Hugo™ RAS system is an investigational device not for sale.

This strategic move aims to streamline operations and focus investments on higher-margin products. The company, valued at approximately $32 billion, is grappling with evolving consumer preferences, particularly the growing demand for healthier food options, while facing financial pressures from inflation and shifting shopping habits.

In an effort to adapt to these market dynamics, Kraft Heinz introduced a zero-salt-and-sugar ketchup. However, despite such innovations, the company is experiencing declining sales and stiffening competition. Recent financial results reflect this trend, with two consecutive years of revenue decline and a revised future outlook.

Kraft Heinz’s ongoing restructuring efforts include the divestment of its Italian baby food business, which was sold to New Princes for €120 million. These moves are part of a broader strategy to reinvest in the company’s core areas, positioning itself for long-term growth and value creation. The split, expected to be formalised soon, is seen as a potential means of unlocking greater shareholder value.

This comes as, earlier this month, Costco shoppers were warned of two kinds of tires - the Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C and the Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires Size 235/40R19 - had been recalled over safety issues.

Michelin issued a recall notice for the Agilis CrossClimate C-metric tires because the size did not comply with regulatory requirements and posed a greater risk of a crash.

""Chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block,"" the recall stated.

The recall also noted that tire identification information is usually written on the side of each tire, directly above the bead.

Drivers who believe they purchased the recalled product were urged to double-check if they possess the faulty tires.

Those who bought the Michelin tires were asked to visit their local Michelin retailer, who would remove and replace the product with an equivalent tire.

Drivers will not be charged for the service.

The other tire, by Bridgestone Blizzak, was recalled because it did not comply with certain safety measures.

According to the recall, the Blizzak 6 tires ""did not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls.""

""The Department of Transportation has found that tires missing the required DOT symbol may be used in appropriate applications, increasing the risk of a crash,"" the recall said.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/newspress-collage-odyywqbwi-1752569226788.jpg?1752554854&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-15 07:04:38.294639

Owner and operator Jerry Tonelli announced the San Francisco store would be shuttering following his retirement.

The store has outlasted pharmacy empires like Walgreens, CVS and Rite Aid, along with various mail order services.

While the closure has come as a shock to some customers, Jerry assured them that it was his decision to close the store and that he was leaving on his own terms.

'It is time for all of us to start a new phase in our lives and spend more time with our families,' he wrote in a Facebook post.

The longtime store has been in the same building since 1918 and was purchased by the Tonelli family in 1965.

Jerry took over the store in 1978 following the death of his father and has worked with family members like his brother, Paul, who also owns a share of the business.

With other relatives uninterested in taking over the business, Jerry began measures to close up, including thanking loyal customers and patients.

The Tonelli family's pharmaceutical run began when Dino Tonelli, Jerry's father, began working at the store in 1949.

The late employee had graduated from a pharmacy school at UCSF and served in World War II before taking over the business, but not before meeting his wife.

'My mother started working here when she was 16, and she died in 2023 at the age of 96,' Jerry told CBS News.

'So, she had quite a run here, and this was her favorite part of the store because she used to do all the buying for the cosmetics, for the perfumes.'

His parents teamed up in keeping the business strong before Dino's death, leaving Jerry to learn by 'trial and error' in his thirties.

The soon-to-be-retiree managed to keep the business going and made new friends along the way that were grateful for his help.

'We get a lot of people from other countries that don't have health insurance and don't want to see a doctor,' he revealed.

'They'll come in and ask this and ask that and try to treat them with over-the-counter medication to help them out.'

Many customers have shared memories and stories of how Central Drug Store has helped them in some way while growing up.

'As a young girl in the 50s my mom, Tosca Chiantelli and I came in your store every Saturday and looked at everything in the displays and picked up prescriptions and necessities,' a Facebook user wrote.

The customer continued by saying she visited the pharmacy regularly in the 70s and 80s, and how happy she was about the pharmacy continuing to help her parents for decades.

'I used to love going into the drugstore with my mom as a little girl. Silvana was always my favorite at the make up counter,' another social media user commented.

Longtime customer Fran Colombo has been going to the store for the last 50 years explained the family would make everyone feel special as soon as they walk in the door.

She was also touched by Jerry escorting her husband to his car, saying his action went 'above and beyond.'

Now that the store is shuttering, Colombo is trying to figure out what to do next, and is questioning what other customers will do.

'I'm kind of computer savvy, but what about the people who aren't, who are just used to the walking in and calling in a prescription and walking in and picking it up? What are they going to do?,' she asked.

Jerry admitted that one of his biggest concerns was independent pharmacies being forced out by various pharmaceutical empires.

However, some of those companies have been struggling in recent years.

Rite Aid, a once-popular chain with over 5,000 stores, filed for bankruptcy in 2023 and again in May this year. It is now planning to shutter all its stores.

The status of CVS has also been concerning since the chain planned to close 900 stores by the end of 2024.

Currently operating over 9,000 US locations, CVS is also set to shutter hundreds of stores this year.

If that wasn't enough, Walgreens has been in the process of shuttering 1,200 stores, including 450 this year.

While the pharmaceutical crisis continues to be on the rise, Jerry will be busy golfing, spending time with family, and continuing to help people by volunteering at hospitals or shelters.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/14/20/100302991-0-image-m-79_1752521851608.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 09:03:17.360466

Kennedy has targeted the use of artificial dyes in the nation’s food since taking the lead at HHS.
Companies, including Kraft Heinz and Nestle, pledged earlier this year to remove artificial dyes from their products.
“Today’s announcement represents a commitment by dozens of individual ice cream companies,” Jacobs said.
The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.","(WHTM) – Dozens of ice cream manufacturers in the United States have pledged to eliminate artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.

On Monday, the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) joined Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other national health leaders to announce the commitment to remove artificial colors.

Specifically, the IDFA said the companies that produce more than 90 percent of ice cream sold in the U.S. — or about 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts — will remove Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5, and Yellow 6 from their ice cream and frozen dairy desserts.

The commitment applies to products made with real milk sold at food retail locations, not products made with non-dairy ingredients and those made in-house at local businesses.

Kennedy has targeted the use of artificial dyes in the nation’s food since taking the lead at HHS. Companies, including Kraft Heinz and Nestle, pledged earlier this year to remove artificial dyes from their products.

In place of artificial colors, manufacturers should use ones made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.

“I applaud the International Dairy Foods Association for stepping up to eliminate certified artificial colors,” Kennedy said. “The American people have made it clear—they want real food, without chemicals. Together, we will Make America Healthy Again.”

Andy Jacobs, chair of the IDFA Ice Cream Board and CEO of Turkey Hill Dairy, Inc., based in Conestoga, Pa., joined Kennedy during the announcement on Monday.

“Today’s announcement represents a commitment by dozens of individual ice cream companies,” Jacobs said. “From small independent companies to family-owned businesses going back generations, to large multi-national companies—we have all come together in a true industry-wide effort to make these changes.”

A full list of companies participating in the initiative was not provided. A spokesperson for the IDFA said the announcement on Monday “fulfills our role as representatives of the fully dairy supply chain, including ice cream makers.’

Nexstar’s WTHM has reached out to HHS for a list of companies that have committed to the plan.

The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.

Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that “most children have no adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them.

The national focus on artificial food dyes is “a good step to take,” but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.

“Just taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,” she said. “It still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.”

However, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called “a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.”

Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.

Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won’t guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.

“Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It’s easy for companies to make promises to look like they’re being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.”

Located in the Bandra-Kurla Complex, an upscale business center in the financial capital Mumbai, the showroom will serve as Tesla’s flagship retail and experience outlet as the company introduces its EV lineup to Indian customers.

Tesla’s entry to India comes after years of delays and policy friction, marking a pivotal expansion in a fast-growing consumer base while global sales are plunging and the company faces challenges in its two core markets, China and the U.S.

Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply from April to June as boycotts over Elon Musk’s political views continued keeping buyers away.

For India, Tesla’s entry signals rising investor confidence and strengthens its move towards clean mobility.

The country’s nascent electric vehicle market made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.

Tesla will begin by importing and selling its popular Y model cars in India. The base price would be 6.78 million rupees ($79,089) for the long-range, rear-wheel drive vehicle, according to a presentation by the company during the showroom launch Tuesday.

By comparison, the price tag is around $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.

The rear-wheel drive will sell for around 6 million rupees ($70,000) in India. Delivery is expected to start from the third quarter, Tesla officials said.

Tesla's higher pricing is likely to make its cars unaffordable for most Indians .

Tesla will compete mostly with German luxury carmakers such as BMW and Mercedes Benz Group AG, and not budget Indian players like Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. The luxury car market makes up just about 1% of total vehicle sales

The debut by American EV giant, however, would bring in world class technology to the country, auto analyst Gaurav Vangaal said.

“With deeper local investments, Tesla can accelerate India’s EV ecosystem, drive innovation and support the government’s goal of higher EV penetration,” said Vangaal, an associate director with S & P Global Mobility.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has wooed Tesla for years for its global brand value and to boost the country’s clean energy endeavors.

CEO Elon Musk invited Indians in April 2016 to preorder the upcoming Tesla Model 3. Several customers placed an order but the cars never arrived and the booking amount had to be refunded.

Despite his earlier enthusiasm, in 2019 Musk expressed concern in a post on his social media platform X that import taxes could double prices of Tesla cars, making them “unaffordable.”

Tesla pressed Indian authorities to cut import taxes on EVs, which were up to 100%, to be able to test the local market. New Delhi, however, wanted Tesla to set up manufacturing facilities so a comprehensive policy could benefit all the players in the sector.

The dynamics changed after Modi and Musk met in the U.S. in February during a state visit by Modi.

Barely a month later, India rolled out a new policy to woo the likes of Tesla, reducing import taxes to 15% from 70% to 100% for EVs priced cheaper than $35,000 as long the automaker committed to building a factory in the country within three years.

Soon after, Musk announced he would visit India in April to meet Modi. It was widely expected he would unveil Tesla’s plans to set up manufacturing facilities and commit billions of dollars in investments. But Musk cancelled the visit, citing “very heavy Tesla obligations,” and travelled to China instead.

Since then, Tesla has conveyed it does not have an immediate interest in manufacturing in India.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said it would be “unfair” to the U.S. if Tesla builds a factory in India to circumvent that country’s tariffs. India and the U.S. are currently negotiating a bilateral trade agreement for greater market access and reducing tariffs on most goods, including automobiles.

Besides bringing Tesla to India, Musk’s India ambition has been to launch Starlink’s commercial internet services. The plan got a boost recently after the company secured regulatory clearances.

Starlink now needs to secure telecommunications airwaves from the government, which may take at least a couple of months, before the services are formally launched.

The Indonesian Ministry of Health and Royal Philips have entered into a partnership for long-term health system transformation.

They signed a memorandum of understanding which aims to enhance the Indonesian health system's resilience and enable more equitable access to high-quality care.

Digital health was identified as one of the three key focus areas of their collaboration. They seek to integrate digital technologies across the health system ""to enhance service quality, strengthen system integration, and improve operational efficiency nationwide.""

They also intend to focus on clinical capacity building and skills development – particularly in radiology, cardiovascular care, and interventional procedures – and setting up a training centre and a service hub.

Specific programs will be outlined in technical cooperation agreements that will follow, Philips noted.

""Through this collaboration, the ministry aims to promote the adoption of advanced health technologies and digital health infrastructure. This initiative represents a vital investment in building a more resilient and globally competitive healthcare system for Indonesia’s future,"" commented Indonesian MOH secretary-general Kunta Wibawa Dasa Nugraha.

GenAI for preventing dementia, other age-related diseases

South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Korea Health Industry Development Institute are seeking organisations that will lead its seven new projects under the Korean Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H).

Two projects will develop foundational AI models for assessing cognitive decline and ageing risks.

Another project will also develop AI for addressing hospital-acquired infections. Meanwhile, a project will utilise quantum computing in discovering new drug candidates as part of novel drug development.

In May, three Korean ARPA-H projects were announced, which include the development of an AI-powered assistant robot for surgeries.

The Korean government has set aside a total of 1.2 trillion won ($830 million) through 2032 for the program.

Hong Kong study first to use AI to predict individual tooth decay

Dentistry researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) have developed what could be the world's first AI system for predicting individual tooth risk of dental cavities in children based on microbial characteristics.

The AI system called Spatial-MiC was developed based on the research team's findings of distinct microbial patterns that predict tooth decay from tracking over 2,500 individual tooth plaque samples of 89 children aged 3-5.

In their study, which findings have been published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, the AI system demonstrated 98% accuracy in detecting existing cavities and 93% accuracy in predicting cavities two months before they became clinically apparent.

According to HKU, these findings may pave the way for precision dentistry that provides targeted preventive care to high-risk teeth.

""We've moved from seeing cavities as inevitable to being able to predict and prevent them at the microbial level, tooth by tooth,"" stressed Shi Huang, study lead and assistant professor of Microbiology at the HKU Faculty of Dentistry.

CUHK Medical Centre doubles down on AI

CUHK Medical Centre (CUHKMC), the teaching hospital of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), is expanding its application of AI through its latest collaboration.

It has signed a memorandum of understanding with local startup SmartCare to implement AI technology ""to enhance clinical workflows, improve patient care, and streamline operational efficiency within CUHKMC’s facilities.""

For its part, SmartCare will provide its AI-powered solutions, including a consultation platform, while CUHKMC will facilitate access to its AI lab for the development and integration of SmartCare's solutions.

""By integrating AI into our clinical practices, we aim to enhance clinical efficiency and provide a more personalised and efficient healthcare experience for our patients,"" said CUHKMC CEO Dr Fung Hong in a statement.

SK Biopharmaceuticals incorporates genAI in novel drug development

SK Biopharmaceuticals will be leveraging generative AI in developing a new solution to automate the creation of approval documents in the early stage of novel drug development.

It recently entered into a partnership with California-based PhynX Lab, a startup backed by its parent, SK Group, to jointly develop a customised solution to automate early tasks in novel drug development using the genAI platform Cheiron.

Unveiled late last year, Cheiron is touted as the first pharmacy-specific genAI platform to be introduced in South Korea. Based on a press release, it can automate literature searches, data analysis, and document creation by tapping into and utilising large databases from leading institutions, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration, the Medical Subject Headings classification system of the US National Library of Medicine, and the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June.
Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”","The latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global has shown how uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June. According to the data, permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

At the same time, the overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring,” noted Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, “But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering – which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said: “There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery,” Carberry went on: “The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”",https://www.theglobalrecruiter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1102351094-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 04:58:45.621011

Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co., expressed confidence in the company’s future, asserting, “We are fundamentally evolving into a higher growth, higher margin organization, with enhanced cash flows and returns on invested capital.”

Second Quarter Performance

The second quarter, which concluded on June 1, was a strong one for Levi Strauss & Co. The company achieved a 6% increase in net revenues on a reported basis and a 9% increase on an organic basis, culminating in a total revenue of US$1.4 billion.

Regionally, organic sales rose 9% in the Americas and 15% in Europe. However, sales remained stagnant in Asia. Net income from continuing operations also witnessed a remarkable increase, rising from $17 million in the previous year to $80 million.

The group, which aggregates demand from its members, will spend $1.7 million to buy credits from U.S.-firm Karbonetiq, Italy-based Limenet and Canadian firm pHathom.

By contracting to buy early, the firms are better able to hire, raise finance and get the technologies off the ground, said Hannah Bebbington, head of deployment at Frontier.

“It allows companies to demonstrate commercial viability,” she said.

Frontier’s support for these early stage firms, which aim to lock emissions away in the ocean or in rocks and industrial waste, marks its fifth series of commitments.

Frontier, which was set up in 2022, aims to invest at least $1 billion in carbon removal credits between 2022 and 2030. It has already committed $600 million, some on the series of pre-purchases and the bulk on a series of off-take agreements with larger firms. Last week, it agreed to pay $41 million for 116,000 tons from waste biomass firm Arbor.

For oceans, the aim is to increase the alkalinity of the water, helping it to lock away more carbon emissions. This is often done by adding “quicklime”, made from limestone.

For the mineralization technologies, meanwhile, projects attempt to speed up the process whereby rocks and industrial waste naturally absorb carbon dioxide, for example by crushing up the material to create a larger surface area.

Bebbington said both technologies had the potential to be impactful because they could be scaled quickly and cheaply.

Energy from the rooftop solar installation accounts for 65-70% of the company’s total electricity consumption. The system generates 540,750 kWh of power annually.

The installation comprises 714 high-efficiency bifacial modules supplied by RenewSys and three 100 kW inverters from Growatt New Energy.

HP Adhesives’ decision to adopt solar energy was driven by high electricity costs and its commitment to sustainability.

Mihir Shah, Chief Financial Officer at HP Adhesives, stated, “We have been able to reduce almost 60% to 65% of the electricity bills monthly by installing rooftop solar. We are also planning to expand our installations at the premises in the future.”

In its annual report 2023-24, the company had said that it was in the process of installing solar panels at its manufacturing plant. “We recognize the importance of environmentally responsible practices and strive to minimize our carbon footprint through sustainable manufacturing processes,” it said in the report.

Pune-based Kalpa Power, which executed and commissioned the project for HP Adhesives, said scheduling the reinforced cement concrete work while monitoring weather conditions during the monsoon was the primary challenge; however, the installation was completed without delay.

Shrikant Soni, Deputy General Manager at Kalpa Power, said, “We offer five-year operations and maintenance services for the project, which include periodic cleaning, plant monitoring through a supervisory control and data acquisition system, and monthly generation reports. These services are renewable after the initial five-year period.” The company also offers performance guarantees with a guaranteed performance ratio and component warranties.

At a recent C&I Clean Energy Meet hosted by Mercom India in Mumbai, industry experts shared insights on how C&I businesses can save on power bills by switching to solar and choosing between open-access and rooftop solar solutions.

Mercom India has been organizing a series of C&I Clean Energy Meets which are designed to provide C&I energy buyers with the knowledge and tools they need to adopt clean energy solutions and lower their power costs.

The next event in the series is scheduled to be held in Hyderabad on August 22, 2025.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-07-15T105851.225.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:01:18.811377

While stablecoins offer features like fast transactions, low fees, and round-the-clock availability, Mastercard believes these are not enough to make them viable for everyday payments.

According to Bloomberg, Chief Product Officer Jorn Lambert said stablecoins still lack the essential elements that drive consumer adoption, such as a smooth user experience, broad distribution and ease of use.

Since at least 2021, Mastercard has been building out partnerships and infrastructure to support stablecoin transactions.

These efforts include a collaboration with Paxos to support the minting and redemption of the USDG stablecoin, and ongoing support for tokens like USDC from Circle, PYUSD from PayPal, and FIUSD from Fiserv.

Despite these developments, Lambert pointed out that around 90 percent of stablecoin usage is still concentrated in cryptocurrency trading.

Some platforms like Shopify and Coinbase have started enabling stablecoin payments for consumers, but uptake remains limited due to friction at checkout and unclear benefits compared to traditional payment methods.

Stablecoins were initially promoted as a way to bypass card networks and lower transaction costs.

However, companies like Mastercard are now reframing their role, positioning themselves as infrastructure providers that can help stablecoins scale securely through integration with existing financial systems.

Raj Seshadri, Mastercard’s Chief Commercial Payments Officer, noted that the real cost of using stablecoins goes beyond the token itself.

It includes conversion to and from fiat currency, compliance requirements, and settlement processes, all of which add layers of complexity to what should be a seamless transaction.

Beyond the private sector, central banks and financial regulators are also paying close attention to stablecoins.

Lambert said banks are weighing whether to issue their own stablecoins or deposit tokens to maintain control over customer funds.

At the same time, governments are looking to promote domestic digital currency innovation to avoid increased dependence on foreign currencies.",https://fintechnews.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mastercard-Stablecoins-Not-Yet-Ready-for-Everyday-Payment-Use.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:58:33.880438

He succeeds Aseem Kaushik, who will take over as Chairman of L’Oréal India, signalling the company’s renewed focus on long-term growth and market leadership in India.

The move is seen as a pivotal shift as the beauty giant aims to double its business in India and significantly expand its local production, according to global CEO Nicolas Hieronimus. The country currently produces half a billion units annually—a figure L’Oréal aims to more than double in the coming years.

Lebel currently heads L’Oréal’s Consumer Products Division in Mexico, where he led the business through a phase of accelerated growth. A seasoned global executive, he brings with him two decades of experience across Procter & Gamble and AB InBev in Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa. His appointment is expected to inject global insight into the company’s local strategy as L’Oréal India seeks to scale aggressively in a dynamic and competitive beauty landscape.

Aseem Kaushik, who has been with L’Oréal India since the 1990s, is credited with establishing major consumer brands like Garnier and Maybelline in the country. As Chairman, he will now focus on enhancing corporate reputation, managing public affairs, and deepening stakeholder engagement and CSR initiatives. His elevation underscores the company’s commitment to anchoring local leadership while embracing global expertise.

The leadership reshuffle comes at a time when L’Oréal India is charting an ambitious growth path. Group CEO Nicolas Hieronimus recently stated that the company plans to more than double its India business and production capacity in the coming years. Currently producing around 500 million units annually, L’Oréal aims to significantly expand its manufacturing footprint, particularly with growing export potential to Gulf countries.

According to reports, L’Oréal India posted ₹5,685 crore in sales in FY25, marking a 14% growth year-on-year. However, profits remained flat at ₹488 crore, largely due to intensifying competition from digital-first, D2C, and regional beauty brands. The company now plans to strengthen its presence across both mass and premium segments, with a portfolio that includes L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline, Garnier, NYX, Kiehl’s, Lancôme, and Yves Saint Laurent.

With a robust local presence through factories in Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh, and R&D centers in Mumbai and Bengaluru, L’Oréal India produces nearly 95% of the products it sells domestically. It also continues to invest in innovation and startup partnerships, including recent investments in Indian beauty startups Deconstruct and Arata.

As India’s beauty and personal care market races towards an estimated $34 billion by 2028, L’Oréal’s leadership transition signals its intent to remain at the forefront of transformation, combining local agility with global vision.",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/08c974ba3569e884104f2280bfd3543b.jpeg,N,,2025-07-15 07:04:19.783438

A spokesperson for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.
In 2019, when Kraft Heinz wrote down $15.4 billion for some well-known brands, this CEO of Berkshire stated that the company overpaid when acquiring Kraft.
Its investment in The Kraft Heinz common stock also brought in over $6 billion in dividend income.
In recent years, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has gradually reduced its shareholding in The Kraft Heinz.","According to the Zhiyin Finance APP, in 2015, Warren Buffett supported the establishment of The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC.US) and publicly claimed it was an opportunity to ""bring iconic brands together.” However, ten years later, the company plans to divest many of its brands, which is considered a rare setback for the renowned investor.

Since Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and private equity firm 3G Capital teamed up to merge these two consumer goods companies, Kraft Heinz's stock price has dropped more than 60%, while the overall stock market has significantly risen during the same period. Berkshire’s approximately 27% shareholding has decreased in market cap by about $4.5 billion, and leaving the market now would further widen the loss.

For the 94-year-old Buffett, this deal represents one of the rare missteps in his career. He will step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. at the end of this year, closing a 60-year professional life during which he has profited handsomely from investments in many well-known brands. Although stable dividend income and the profits gained from acquiring Heinz in the two years prior to the merger with Kraft keep Berkshire overall in a profit state, had this common stock investment instead been directed toward the overall stock market, the group could have made nearly $10 billion more.

Matthew Palazzola, Senior Analyst at Bloomberg Industry Research, said: ""Perhaps he didn’t anticipate that the market would shift towards healthier options. Kraft Heinz holds a significant position in processed foods, and Buffett’s own dietary habits have never been particularly healthy, which perhaps made it difficult for him to foresee this trend."" A spokesperson for Berkshire Hathaway Inc. did not respond to a request for comment.

Kraft Heinz owns many well-known brands such as Oscar Mayer and Kraft Mac & Cheese but has been impacted in recent years by inflation and declining demand for packaged foods, in part driven by the prevalence of weight loss drugs. According to previous reports, the company is currently considering a business split, separating a significant portion of its operations into a new entity.

Buffett has long admitted that the investment in Kraft was not the best choice. In 2019, when Kraft Heinz wrote down $15.4 billion for some well-known brands, this CEO of Berkshire stated that the company overpaid when acquiring Kraft.

However, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. earned billions through the dividends from the preferred shares of Heinz and the redemption of those shares in 2016, thereby achieving profitability. Its investment in The Kraft Heinz common stock also brought in over $6 billion in dividend income.

In recent years, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has gradually reduced its shareholding in The Kraft Heinz. Earlier this year, The Kraft Heinz stated that two board members associated with Berkshire would resign, and indicated that this was not due to disagreements with management or the Board of Directors regarding the company's operation, policies, or practices.

Currently, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. still holds a large number of shares in the company. If a spin-off could boost the returns of this food enterprise, Buffett may gain more benefits. Before news of the spin-off emerged, The Kraft Heinz's stock price had already risen nearly 5% by Thursday's close.

CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert stated: ""The spin-off will improve the performance of this investment. Frankly, its prior performance has not been ideal.""",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000138b797f787435.jpg,N,,2025-07-15 03:58:50.662410

HM Brandt, a demolition contractor based in Lannon, Wisconsin, has applied for a permit with the City of Milwaukee for demolition of the concourse. Construction is not imminent, though.

As consumers increasingly demand authenticity, sustainability, and direct engagement with brands, traditional wholesale models are being supplanted by a focus on Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) dominance. Few companies exemplify this transformation better than Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI), which has now recorded 13 consecutive quarters of DTC revenue growth, while simultaneously expanding margins to historic highs. This structural pivot isn't just a temporary boost—it's the foundation of a durable competitive advantage.

The DTC Revolution: Levi's Blueprint for Growth

Levi's Q2 2025 results underscore its evolution from a denim manufacturer to a lifestyle brand. DTC revenue now accounts for 50% of total sales, growing 11% year-over-year, while its DTC EBIT margins surged by 400 basis points to become a profit engine. This shift is no accident:

Channel Optimization: By prioritizing high-margin DTC channels (e.g., owned stores, e-commerce), Levi reduced reliance on wholesale partners, which historically diluted margins and diluted brand control.

Brand Equity: Unaided brand awareness has risen sharply in key markets, fueled by cultural partnerships (e.g., collaborations with Beyoncé, Nike) and a focus on SKU rationalization. This has driven full-price sell-through, a critical metric for profitability.

Margin Expansion: From Survival to Thrival

Levi's margin story is as compelling as its top-line growth. Gross margin hit 62.6% in Q2, a record high, propelled by:

- Cost Discipline: Lower product costs and SKU simplification reduced inventory bloat.

- Tariff Mitigation: Despite punitive tariffs on Chinese imports, Levi's strategic supply chain diversification (e.g., shifting production to Vietnam, Mexico) limited margin erosion to just 20 basis points annually.

Adjusted EBIT margins expanded by 190 basis points to 8.3%, while SG&A expenses shrunk as a percentage of revenue. This margin resilience positions Levi to outperform peers in a high-interest-rate environment.

Strategic Moves to Outrun Macroeconomic Headwinds

Levi's leadership isn't just about cutting costs—it's about owning the future. Consider these moves:

1. Product Diversification: Women's apparel now accounts for 38% of sales (up from 19% in 2019), while tops and outerwear—non-traditional denim categories—are surging. This shift into higher-margin segments reduces reliance on commoditized jeans.

2. Asia Restructuring: While cutting ties with underperforming wholesale partners in India and Malaysia temporarily dampened growth, it's a long-term win. Management emphasized prioritizing profitability over volume in markets like China, where Levi is now doubling down on e-commerce.

3. Inventory Prudence: A 15% year-over-year inventory jump may raise short-term concerns, but it's a calculated hedge against supply chain disruptions and holiday demand.

Why Levi's Resilience Justifies an Overweight Position

Critics might argue that Levi's stock (currently trading at $26.50) already reflects its success. But three factors suggest further upside:

1. Structural Tailwinds: The apparel industry's shift to DTC is irreversible. Levi's 13-quarter streak proves its model works.

- Historical context confirms that when Levi beats earnings expectations, its stock has shown a 36.36% 3-day win rate and 27.27% 30-day win rate, underscoring short-term momentum while reinforcing its long-term structural advantages.

2. Margin Leverage: With $51 million returned to shareholders in Q2 (via dividends) and plans to repurchase shares using Dockers sale proceeds, Levi's capital allocation is shareholder-friendly.

3. Global Brand Momentum: Europe's 15% organic growth and Asia's DTC surge (despite regional headwinds) indicate Levi's is becoming a true global lifestyle brand.

Risks and Mitigants

Asia Uncertainty: Strategic exits in underperforming markets could delay near-term growth, but profitability is the priority.

Wholesale Caution: Management's conservative wholesale outlook reflects a focus on quality over quantity—a disciplined stance in uncertain times.

Final Take: Levi's is More Than a Jeans Maker—It's a Structural Play

Levi's transformation isn't just a story of margin expansion; it's a masterclass in redefining an industry. By leaning into DTC, brand equity, and product diversification, Levi has insulated itself from cyclical risks while positioning itself as a leader in a $3 trillion apparel market.

For investors, the case is clear: Levi's structural advantages—high-margin DTC dominance, resilient brand power, and disciplined capital allocation—warrant an overweight position. Even in a slowing economy, Levi's focus on full-price sales and cost control makes it a rare apparel stock capable of thriving.

Actionable Insight: Consider adding LEVI to portfolios with a 12-18 month horizon, targeting a price target of $32-$35 based on its updated EPS guidance and margin trajectory.

Leaders from Starbucks, CVS Health, Walmart, Sam’s Club, Otis Elevator, LockNet and Step ‘n Wash are working with the American Association of People with Disabilities on a new effort dubbed The Access Coalition: Creating More Inclusive Retail Spaces.

Through the coalition, the companies say they will take steps to promote adoption of the Inclusive Spaces Framework, a set of accessibility guidelines developed by Starbucks that includes everything from optimized acoustics and lighting to power-operated doors, accessible equipment for employees and barrier-free pathways.

“The Access Coalition is a powerful example of the positive impact that can occur when industry comes together with community to co-create spaces that reflect and adapt to the range of consumer experiences,” said Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

Starbucks introduced the Inclusive Spaces Framework last year when it opened its first store designed to meet the new standards at Union Market in Washington, D.C. The company has committed to apply the framework at all newly built and renovated company-operated stores in the U.S.

“We’ve learned that this approach improves the experience for everyone, especially people with disabilities, and is also good for businesses,” said Dawn Clark, senior vice president of coffeehouse design and concepts at Starbucks.

Fellow members of The Access Coalition are now working toward piloting the design changes at their retail locations nationwide and they’re encouraging other companies to join them in enhancing accessibility.

The Q2 earnings will either validate its premium or expose it to a reckoning.","Boston Scientific (BSX) stands at a pivotal moment. With its July 23 earnings report looming, investors are betting on the medical device giant to deliver another quarter of robust growth—and justify its sky-high valuation. The company's Q1 2025 results, which saw revenue surge 20.9% year-over-year, were a masterclass in execution, but the question now is whether this momentum can sustain itself. Let's dissect the catalysts, risks, and valuation to determine if this is a buy, hold, or sell ahead of earnings.

The Earnings Catalysts: Where the Magic Happens

Boston Scientific's Q2 results will hinge on two critical pillars: the performance of its FARAPULSE™ PFA System and the integration of its recent acquisitions.

FARAPULSE™ Dominance:

In Q1, the FARAPULSE system drove a staggering 29.8% growth in Cardiology sales, outperforming rival Medtronic's Arctic Front device. Clinical trial data from the SINGLE SHOT CHAMPION trial showed superiority in treating atrial fibrillation, a condition affecting millions. Investors will scrutinize Q2's ELEVATE-PF trial results for the FARAFLEX™ PFA Catheter, which could further cement its leadership in this $2.6 billion ablation market.

Acquisition Synergy:

The $1.1 billion acquisition of SoniVie Ltd., which develops renal denervation technology for hypertension, and the Bolt Medical deal for lithotripsy innovations, are now in the integration phase. Management's ability to cross-sell these technologies into its existing cardiovascular and urology networks will be key.

Geographic Expansion:

The U.S. market delivered 31.1% revenue growth in Q1, but emerging markets like Asia-Pacific and Latin America, which grew 10.6% and 14.1% operationally, respectively, offer untapped potential. Success here could offset headwinds in Europe, where reimbursement delays have historically plagued the sector.

Valuation: A Premium Price for a Growth Story

Boston Scientific's valuation is unequivocally aggressive. Its trailing P/E of 76.13 is nearly double its sector peers' average, and its EV/EBITDA of 36.46 places it in rarified air. Yet, this premium is not without justification:

Growth Metrics:

The company's 17.6% revenue growth in 2024 and a raised 2025 guidance of 15-17% organic growth suggest it's outpacing the broader medical device industry, which faces regulatory and pricing headwinds.

Margin Expansion:

Despite heavy R&D spending ($1.5 billion annually), Boston Scientific has managed to keep EBITDA margins steady at 25.8%, a feat in a cost-conscious sector.

But risks loom large. The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.52, while manageable, rises with its recent $1.5 billion debt issuance to fund acquisitions. Meanwhile, peers like Medtronic (MDT) trade at a P/E of 24.7x, and Abbott Labs (ABT) at 17.1x, underscoring the premium investors are paying for BSX's growth.

The Red Flags: Why Caution Remains

Margin Pressure:

With acquisitions and R&D spending, maintaining margins is critical. A single misstep—say, a delay in SoniVie's hypertension product—could crimp profitability.

Sector Headwinds:

The medical device sector's Zacks Industry Rank of 143/250 reflects broader challenges: slowing demand in Europe, Medicare's price caps, and competition from generics.

Valuation Sensitivity:

A Q2 miss—say, revenue below $4.85 billion or EPS below $0.71—could trigger a sharp correction. Technicals show the stock is already trading above its 50-day moving average of $90.39, leaving it vulnerable to profit-taking.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, or Wait for a Pullback?

The math here is stark: Boston Scientific's valuation demands flawless execution. If Q2 results beat estimates ($0.72 EPS, $4.89B revenue), the stock could rally toward its $117 price target (a 13% upside from current levels). Analysts at Citi and Truist have already raised targets, citing its “best-in-class” innovation pipeline.

History suggests that positive earnings surprises have been rewarding for investors. Over the past three years, when Boston Scientific exceeded earnings expectations, its stock demonstrated a 55.56% win rate over three days, rising to 77.78% over both 10 and 30 days, according to backtesting. This historical performance underscores the potential upside if Q2 results exceed expectations.

However, investors should prepare for volatility. The stock's RSI below 60 suggests it's not yet overbought, but a post-earnings drop could present a better entry point. Key triggers to watch:

- FARAPULSE's ELEVATE-PF trial data (due Q3).

- Growth in emerging markets, particularly in renal denervation and lithotripsy.

- Margin commentary from management, which could temper or fuel valuation multiples.

Final Call: A High-Risk, High-Reward Play

Boston Scientific is a speculative buy for investors willing to bet on its growth trajectory. The Q2 earnings will either validate its premium or expose it to a reckoning. For a 6–12 month horizon, the rewards outweigh the risks—if the company hits its targets.

Recommendation:

- Buy at $104.50, targeting $120 with a $95 stop-loss to manage downside.

- Hold if earnings miss, but watch for a pullback to $90 before considering entry.

In the end, Boston Scientific's story is as much about its ability to innovate as it is about executing on the mundane: margins, integration, and market share. July 23 will tell whether this gamble pays off.

On the back of a solid report, Levi’s raised its full-year revenue guidance, expecting sales to climb between 1% and 2%, an improvement from its former guidance of a 1% to 2% decline. It’s also significantly better than the downward 5.2% forecast by analysts, per LSEG.

But this is 2025, and before Levi’s CFO Harmit Singh shared the company’s guidance on an earnings call, he went out of his way to address tariffs, noting that Levi’s guidance “assumes an additional 30% tariff on goods arriving in the US from China and an additional 10% tariff on US imports from the rest of the world.”

While the retailer doesn’t share its primary manufacturing hubs, Singh told CNBC the majority of its supply comes from Southeast Asia, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia, and Trump has recently threatened Bangladesh and Indonesia with higher tariffs.

With its current mitigation strategies in place, including supply chain diversification and vendor negotiations, the company expects tariffs to impact the business for the remainder of the year by 2 or 3 cents per share, or $25 to $30 million.

“We are doing our part. We are absorbing some of the costs. What helps is that our business is so strong,” Levi’s CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC. “We have been pulling back on promotions anyway, that’s leading to more full-price selling, and some of our new innovation, our new fits, we’re pricing at a premium, and they’re buying. So all of those things help us navigate this time of having the tariff headwind.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/b2782e2c034337c5dd273295d23cf1412f28eef1-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-15 03:59:04.935386

We've always had this ambition to create world class creativity from Queensland, because it's the best place in the world.” “Pull Versus Push”: Expanding Nationally Outside of Queensland, Publicis Worldwide works with clients from all over the country.","Publicis Worldwide will keep its name across eight agencies, in markets including Australia, the USA, and Canada, “because we’re strong,” its Australian execs have told LBB.

At the start of the year, Publicis Groupe globally merged the agency with Leo Burnett to create Leo, but in the local market, both Leo and the Queensland-based Publicis Worldwide will continue as brands.

Publicis Worldwide Australia ECD Ryan Petie told LBB a compliment from Publicis Groupe APAC CEO, Jane Lin-Baden, summed up the local operation’s strength; she “called us the little tiger of the group.”

“We have it really good because we have our own identity here in Australia, but we're powered by the biggest group in the world now. So it's basically the best of both worlds,” he said.

During an interview with Ryan, MD Simone Waugh, and CSO Simon Murphy during a visit to Sydney from their Brisbane base, the trio was clear they have no shortage of work. Queensland is in the middle of a boom that isn’t predicted to slow down any time soon, especially with Publicis named content partner for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic bid.

“For quite a number of years, Brisbane and Queensland have seen incremental growth, but this is unfair growth,” said Simone. “For the 2032 bid, we had to dive straight in and literally work hand in hand as a partner with the bid team, 24/7 for 30 days and 30 nights to get that bid together.”

Ryan added, “We created something like 30 different films in 30 days for the bid process, and one of them was the final film before the IOC [International Olympic Committee] jury had to press the green button or the red button. So probably the most stressful creative brief we've ever been given. And luckily, we're successful in the bid.”

As part of the bid, Queensland is aiming to make $44 billion in overnight visitor expenditure annually by 2032, which Simon described as “phenomenal statistical growth”. The agency will also be capitalising on that economic injection in its work with Tourism & Events Queensland.

“Momentum is huge in Queensland – it comes from tourism, it comes from immigration, it comes from talent that we can see …That has an impact on the business we're getting and the ambition of the clients that we're getting.”

In its 2025-26 state budget, the Queensland government forecast its economic growth will jump to 2.75% in 2025-26. The most recent Tourism Research Australia data estimates the state’s tourism sector is the second-largest in the country, making up 23.8% national tourism output.

With 2032 in sight, Simon pointed out a big part of the Publicis Worldwide story “started well before” the announcement of Brisbane’s Olympic win. The business is “well established to capitalise on the changes around us,” he said.

“Our story, our understanding of each other, our reflexes when it comes to developing the work is relatively well honed to continue that momentum.”

Ryan laughed, “We've always had that secret ambition – maybe not so secret – but we've always had the ambition for what the state of Queensland could become, and what we could become as an agency. Now it's actually getting fulfilled.

“We were never happy just to get 2% growth each year and a couple of local clients. We've always had this ambition to create world class creativity from Queensland, because it's the best place in the world.”

“Pull Versus Push”: Expanding Nationally

Outside of Queensland, Publicis Worldwide works with clients from all over the country. Simone attributed this to the fact that “we are absolute challengers.”

“We challenge each other. As a strategic and creative client team we will go deep into a business with the senior leaders of the business and find the real problem, challenge the problem, and then actually start looking at solutions.”

She added, “We're absolutely creative first, we believe in creativity as the multiplier effect. It's the one thing that's going to give businesses an unfair advantage going forward.

“Then we'll look at awards after that, we’ll say, ‘Okay, this, this is a good story, we should be putting that up in lights for our clients.’ We don't enter much, but what we do enter has a pretty good strike rate.”

There is a fine line between expanding and biting off more than you can chew. It’s something the team keeps in mind. Simone said the question the leaders ask is, “What is more risky?”

“If you go gung ho all at once, you are pushing yourselves into a market versus being demanded to service in a market. The approach that we're taking is pull versus push. It has to be our reputation and our work, and how we work is what attracts clients.”

Approaching Social Impact and Commercial Work The Same Way

As well as work on major accounts like Subway, Bulla, and Isuzu, Publicis Worldwide also has a large body of social impact and behaviour change work. The business has addressed domestic violence for Red Flags, youth cyberbullying for Convo2019, and vaping and road safety through the ‘Drink Driving UNPLYBL controller’ (pronounced Unplayable).

“Every other agency I've worked out in the past will have one pro bono client,” said Ryan. “We currently are facilitating more than that, because we believe in that balance of making sure people have good in their career.”

Simon has “never made a distinction” between social impact and commercial work.

“We're pretty good at benchmarking the best in the world just to challenge ourselves, and there's no shortage of learning,” he said.

“Because you approach it the same way. What's the human problem we're trying to solve? Can we get to the heart of that? It's just the way we get to it, whether it be engagement, or whether it be through more traditional ways of insight. It's another brief, and you do the best you can.”",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2025-07/publicis-leadership.8zM2GMku.png,N,,2025-07-14 20:59:25.704359

The decision to pull the McPlant was made without a major public announcement. According to a statement from McDonald’s Austria, customer preferences have shifted more towards vegetable-based offerings, prompting the company to focus instead on a vegetarian patty made from vegetables.

Limited vegan options remain

As a result, options for vegan consumers will now be extremely limited, and essentially restricted to side items like French fries. The company also confirmed that no further fully vegan products are currently planned.

The McPlant, introduced in 2021 in collaboration with Beyond Meat, was considered a significant step towards expanding plant-based options in the fast-food sector. However, it only partially met vegan standards, as it was served with cheese and a dairy-based sauce. The recently introduced meat-free alternative featuring a vegetable patty is also not vegan.

Backlash from consumers

Additional background for the discontinuation of the McPlant may lie in the company’s partnership with Beyond Meat. Reports indicate that the collaboration contract has expired and was not renewed. The removal of the McPlant has sparked noticeable criticism on social media.

Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and South Korean battery maker LG Energy Solution, plans to upgrade its plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce multiple battery chemistries under one roof, including its newer, cheaper version.

The companies said July 14 that funding for the upgrades stems from a $2.3-billion investment first announced in 2021 and will allow Ultium to scale production of lithium iron phosphate battery cells, a lower-cost alternative to the nickel-rich batteries the companies also produce together.

Ultium Cells Spring Hill began production in April 2024 producing only nickel cobalt manganese aluminum batteries, which has allowed GM to produce vehicles capable of exceeding 300 miles of range on a charge. General Motors produces the gas-powered Cadillac XT5 the XT6 at its Spring Hill Assembly Plant, as well as the all-electric Cadillac Lyriq.

The other plant co-operated with General Motors in Warren, Ohio, will continue producing cells with nickel cobalt manganese aluminum chemistry, LG Energy Solution said.

“At GM, we’re innovating battery technology to deliver the best mix of range, performance and affordability to our EV customers,” Kurt Kelty, vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability at GM, said in a statement. “This upgrade at Spring Hill will enable us to scale production of lower-cost LFP cell technologies in the U.S., complementing our high-nickel and future lithium manganese rich solutions and further diversifying our growing EV portfolio.”

Conversion of battery cell lines at Spring Hill to produce the new battery cells will begin later this year. LG Energy Solution said commercial production of the lithium iron phosphate batteries is expected by late 2027.

In addition to the two plants jointly operated with General Motors, LG Energy Solution has six other manufacturing facilities operating or under construction in the United States. LG Energy Solution also operates a Honda joint venture in Jeffersonville, Ohio, and a Hyundai Motor Co. facility in Savannah, Georgia.

LG Energy Solution plans to launch production of a new battery chemistry, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028 in partnership with General Motors. The company has not yet announced a production location for that type of battery.

Producing multiple battery types in the same facility allows GM the flexibility to better handle shifts in electric vehicle demand, producing the best option for its broad electric vehicle portfolio, according to Stephanie Brinley, associate director of Auto Intelligence at S&P Global Mobility.

“In concept, it’s not unlike putting the right engine under the right hood,” she said. “For the vehicle that the consumer is looking for, they’re getting the battery with the best combination of range, power and price for the application.”

The current battery chemistry offers high range and performance, perfect for vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq, Optiq and Vistiq. The LFP chemistry is less expensive and still gives the range it needs, Brinley said, whereas the future battery chemistry ― lithium manganese-rich batteries ― will benefit production of large trucks and SUVs.

Employees can opt for a voluntary exit program with a cash payment if they don't want to return to the office.

Niccol cited improved collaboration, problem-solving, and culture-building as reasons for the return-to-office mandate.

Remote workers will have to return to the office at least four days a week – up from three – or take a buyout as CEO Brian Niccol works to turnaround the coffee chain’s prolonged sales slump.

The company's new in-office requirement will apply to all office workers starting in October, Niccol said Monday.

Starbucks is offering employees who decide to leave the company a one-time voluntary exit program that includes a cash payment.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a statement. “We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

Many office workers got hooked on remote work as the COVID-19 pandemic shut down offices across America.

Five years later, a growing number of employers from Amazon to JPMorgan Chase are winding back the clock on remote work.

Starbucks began requiring employees to return to the office at least three days a week in 2023. Now it will also require all corporate people managers working remotely to relocate to Seattle or Toronto within 12 months.

Across industries, the moves have not always been popular with employees. Three-quarters of employed adults who have a job that can be done from home are working remotely at least some of the time, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. If their employer no longer allowed them that flexibility, nearly half said they would be unlikely to stay on.

Also unpopular is the perception of a double standard for executives. Some top executives run their businesses from the comfort of their home office hundreds or even thousands of miles from the corporate headquarters.

Niccol has been Starbucks’ highest-profile remote worker. Last year, the company lured him from Chipotle Mexican Grill with a deal that permits him to commute 1,600 miles from his Newport Beach, California, home to the company’s Seattle headquarters on the company’s private jet and on its dime.

Starbucks says Niccol now has an office and a residence in Seattle.

Niccol’s arrangement attracted a lot of media attention, “putting him in an uncomfortable position,” said Stanford University economics professor Nick Bloom, who studies remote work.

“I suspect part of this move is also for Niccol to reestablish himself as the tough in-person leader and move away from being seen as some kind of work-from-home champion.”

The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.

“This is a Renaissance moment for health in America,” U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.

WATCH: Kennedy, Oz announce insurers’ plan to scale back prior authorizations

About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn’t identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.

The national focus on artificial food dyes is “a good step to take,” but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.

“Just taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,” she said. “It still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.”

However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called “a 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.”

The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.

Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that “most children have no adverse effects” when consuming foods made with them.

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.

The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.

Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that “encourages” them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.

Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won’t guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.

“Talk is cheap,” Galligan said. “It’s easy for companies to make promises to look like they’re being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.”

“First, it addresses the regions shortage of industrial land by repurposing a large unutilized brownfield site into a best-in-class industrial park.","In Metro Vancouver, where industrial land is in critically short supply, Montrose Industries has made a groundbreaking move. The company transformed a 130-hectare landfill, once used for demolition, construction, and land-clearing waste, into the Richmond Industrial Centre (RIC), the region’s largest single-owner-developed business park. Lauded for its innovative approach to regulatory hurdles and infrastructure development, the project is now considered a model for brownfield remediation across Canada.

Located at Blundell Road and Pierson Road, the site reflects Montrose Properties’ commitment to economic growth through sustainable and responsible redevelopment and the project team has been lauded for its outstanding work.

In 2024, the project was recognized by an awards program that celebrates excellence in brownfield projects nationally. The Richmond Industrial Centre Development received the award for “Best Overall Project” at the 25th annual Brownie Awards.

Hosted in partnership with the Canadian Brownfields Network (CBN) and Actual Media Inc., the Brownie Awards recognize excellence in brownfield redevelopment across the country. Spanning across categories like policy, technological innovation, sustainable design, and community engagement, the awards celebrate the wide-ranging impact of turning contaminated sites into productive community assets.

Industrial land crunch in Metro Vancouver

Metro Vancouver is facing a well-documented, critically short supply of industrial land, driven by population growth, rising e-commerce demands, and the expansion of logistics and warehousing sectors.

This shortage has major economic implications. Industrial lands support over 450,000 direct and indirect jobs, contribute $50.1 billion to GDP, and generate $92.5 billion in economic output, roughly one-third of the region’s GDP, according to a report from the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade. With industrial jobs paying over 10 per cent above the national average, the need to repurpose underutilized land has become a pressing issue.

Developers and municipalities are rethinking underutilized or overlooked brownfield sites as opportunities to meet the growing economic demand while maintaining environmental integrity.

Building a hub for industry

Historically, the Richmond Industrial Centre site functioned as a construction waste landfill beginning in the 1970s. Its transformation into a major logistics hub required a long-term vision, extensive engineering, and innovative regulatory navigation. In response to Metro Vancouver’s critical shortage of industrial land, Montrose Properties, working alongside PGL Environmental Consultants, the BC Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Omicron, and the City of Richmond, spearheaded the redevelopment of the 130-hectare site. The project has already delivered 1.4 million square feet of industrial distribution space, with an additional 1.8 million square feet in the pipeline.

A conventional phased development approach conflicted with provincial regulations, particularly in relation to active landfill operations. To resolve this, Montrose and its partners developed a precedent-setting strategy that aligned overlapping regulatory frameworks, including the Landfill Operational Certificate and the BC Contaminated Sites Regulation Instrument, ultimately setting a model for future brownfield redevelopment in British Columbia.

The project underwent a rigorous process of site investigation, remediation, risk assessment, and in-situ risk management. This allowed for the redevelopment of closed sections of the landfill, even while other areas continued to accept waste, an innovative and pioneering regulatory strategy in the province.

To date, five areas of the site have achieved regulatory closure. Four buildings have been completed and are now home to high-profile tenants. At full buildout, the brownfield site will feature 12 industrial warehouse buildings located strategically near Canada’s largest port.

“The project impacts the community in several ways,” explains Tony Morgan, Chief Financial Officer, Montrose Properties. “First, it addresses the regions shortage of industrial land by repurposing a large unutilized brownfield site into a best-in-class industrial park. Secondly, the region benefits from the economic impact of increased property taxes, development cost charges and new jobs. We are deeply honoured that our project has been recognized. This award validates the tremendous effort put forth by our team and key partners in transforming a closed landfill site into much-needed industrial warehouse space. We believe this project provides a valuable template for others to follow in remediating disused landfill sites and converting them into productive lands.”

Economic growth and environmental impact

RIC has significantly boosted industrial productivity and economic growth, attracting major tenants such as Coca-Cola, Wayfair, Canadian Tire, and WorldPac. These businesses bring long-term employment opportunities and have helped expand the city’s tax base. This, in turn, enables the City of Richmond to invest in new infrastructure, improve public services, and support future economic development.

Designed to meet the latest ASHRAE energy efficiency standards, the RIC’s buildings feature sustainable technologies such as LED lighting with motion sensors, insulated tilt-up panels, and electric vehicle charging stations. The site’s tenants hold long-term leases, ensuring their ongoing contributions to local employment and community initiatives.

The environmental benefits of the project extend beyond the buildings themselves. Perimeter restoration work around the landfill has included the removal of invasive plant species and the replanting of native vegetation, enhancing riparian habitat. A long-term monitoring plan will support the establishment of these ecosystems, with future development plans also incorporating a new wetland area.

In addition, the adjacent landfill, still in operation and managed by Ecowaste, a wholly owned subsidiary of Montrose Industries, provides essential recycling and landfilling services for construction and demolition waste. This helps reduce illegal dumping on nearby agricultural lands, cuts down transportation costs for clients, and supports Metro Vancouver’s zero waste goals by diverting material from unauthorized or inefficient disposal.

New future for former wastelands

The Richmond Industrial Centre has redefined how brownfield sites can be regenerated to deliver enduring economic and social benefits. By maximizing the land’s potential, the project has increased local employment, strengthened supply chains, and generated significant tax revenue for both municipal and provincial governments.

The site has seen several transformations over time: initially used for peat mining, then as a landfill for construction and demolition waste, and now as a Class A industrial park home to major distribution centres.

Once destined to remain vacant for generations, the site now generates vital tax revenue, jobs, and public amenities. The project didn’t just deliver industrial space; it reshaped how brownfield reinvestment can meet land demands while supporting long-term sustainability.

“To give partners time to adjust, this expectation will begin with the new fiscal year,” Niccol wrote in the memo.
When Niccol was named CEO last year, Starbucks allowed him to remain in Newport Beach.
Starbucks, for its part, maintains that its office return policy is necessary to drive collaboration and accelerate business recovery.
“As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever,” Niccol said in his memo.","Starbucks will increase its return to work mandate for corporate employees to four days a week — even as CEO Brian Niccol is allowed to work remotely from his California home after getting hired last year.

The new policy, outlined in a companywide message from Niccol, will require corporate employees and managers to be on-site Monday through Thursday at the company’s Seattle and Toronto offices as well as at its North American regional hubs, beginning in January.

“To give partners time to adjust, this expectation will begin with the new fiscal year,” Niccol wrote in the memo.

“We’ll share more details before October, including our plans to ensure everyone has an assigned dedicated desk.”

The shift from three to four required days in the office marks the latest escalation in Starbucks’ broader “Back to Starbucks” turnaround strategy helmed by Niccol, whose main residence is in Newport Beach, Calif.

The company says Niccol’s “default” is to reside in Seattle when he isn’t traveling to the company’s coffeehouses worldwide.

When asked if Niccol works from his California residence, the company declined to comment.

The java giant also is expanding its relocation mandate, requiring all managers at its corporate locations to move to Seattle, Toronto or cities that host regional offices within the next 12 months — a policy that builds on a previous directive for vice presidents and above.

When Niccol was named CEO last year, Starbucks allowed him to remain in Newport Beach.

The company pays for a dedicated remote office near his home, provides a personal assistant and allows him to use a corporate jet to commute to Seattle, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Niccol was awarded roughly $96 million in total compensation after his first four months as Starbucks CEO, with about 94% of that coming from stock awards and an additional $5 million sign-on bonus, the filing showed.

His pay package also included more than $400,000 in perks such as housing, jet travel and security expenses. His annualized pay is estimated at $113 million, placing him among the highest-paid CEOs in the country.

Before tapping the former Chipotle boss, Starbucks was grappling with significant turmoil, including four CEOs in five years, declining sales, profit drops and operational inefficiencies like overcomplicated menus and slow service.

The company also faced labor unrest, legal challenges, and brand identity confusion, while external pressures such as inflation and rising competition further strained performance and investor confidence.

Starbucks has stated that while Niccol is permitted to work remotely, he is expected to spend a significant amount of time at the Seattle corporate headquarters and at company locations around the world.

A company spokesperson previously said that “Brian’s primary office and a majority of his time will be spent in our Seattle Support Centre or out visiting partners and customers in our stores, roasteries, roasting facilities and offices around the world.”

“His schedule will exceed the hybrid work guidelines and workplace expectations we have for all partners,” the spokesperson said.

In his message, Niccol emphasized that human connection remains a foundational value for Starbucks.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together,” he wrote.

“We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster.”

He acknowledged that not all employees would welcome the policy.

“We’ve listened and thought carefully,” he wrote. “But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

Starbucks said it will offer a one-time voluntary exit package for employees who refuse to comply with the new policy.

“If you decide you want to leave Starbucks for any reason, we respect that,” Niccol wrote.

“To support those who decide to ‘opt out,’ we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.”

The internal changes come amid wider scrutiny over executive remote work arrangements.

A recent study by researchers at Boston College and Arizona State University, as cited in the Star Tribune, found that companies led by CEOs who live far from their corporate headquarters often see lower employee satisfaction and weaker financial performance.

The report, which examined nearly 1,000 firms between 2010 and 2019, concluded that so-called “fly-in CEOs” tend to be less informed about day-to-day operations and more focused on short-term gains.

The study noted that about 18% of companies surveyed had CEOs residing far from headquarters.

Geographic trends showed that remote CEOs were more common in colder, landlocked central US states. Despite its climate, Minnesota, for example, had one of the lowest rates of remote CEOs among its Fortune 500 firms.

Starbucks, for its part, maintains that its office return policy is necessary to drive collaboration and accelerate business recovery.

Workers will be expected to be in the office between Monday and Thursday starting in October, up from a previous requirement that staff come in for three days.

The directive is the latest in a series from companies who are pushing to restrict remote working which expanded during the Covid pandemic.

Starbucks workers who choose not to comply with the new policy, which applies to the US and Canada, will be offered a one-time payout if they decide to leave.

Brian Niccol, chief executive at Starbucks who joined the business less than a year ago, said the change would help the firm do its ""best work"" as it faces falling sales and other challenges.

""We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,"" he wrote in a company blog.

""We've listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks,"" he said.

As part of the move, the company will require certain managers to relocate to Seattle, where Starbucks is headquartered, or Toronto.

Mr Niccol's contract did not require him to relocate to Seattle while specifying that the firm would establish a small remote office near his hometown in California.

He has since bought a home in Seattle.

The new policy is part of a series of changes Mr Niccol has made to turn around Starbucks.

These include revamping its menus and coffee shops as well as reversing rules for its cafes in North America that allowed people to use their facilities even if they had not bought anything.

Previously, people were allowed to linger in Starbucks outlets and use their toilets without making a purchase.

Earlier this year, the firm cut 1,100 jobs.

Other companies have also been tightening their remote work policies, including the likes of Amazon and JP Morgan.

Surveys by researchers at Stanford, the Instituto Tecnogolico Autonomo de Mexico and the University of Chicago suggest that overall working practices in recent years have been fairly stable.

Their research has found that in the US, about about a third of staff who can perform their roles remotely have been recalled to the office full-time, while roughly a fifth are fully remote. About 45% enjoy a hybrid policy.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e757/live/047c5500-60f0-11f0-ae6b-f98c94e089e3.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:06.969839

The Seattle-based coffee giant will also force managers who work remotely to relocate to corporate offices in Seattle or Toronto. Employees who aren’t managers but have remote-work status will be allowed to keep it.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told employees in an internal memo made public Monday that the policy shift was intended to reestablish the company’s in-office culture.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach. We’ve listened and thought carefully,” he said. “But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

Niccol also said that if anyone wants to leave the company, for any reason, Starbucks is “offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.”

Starbucks instituted a three-day in-office work policy in January 2023. Employees were expected to come into the office Tuesday and Wednesday each week with teams deciding on a third day. Niccol, who isn’t based in Seattle, escalated enforcement of the policy earlier this year.

Per the terms of his offer letter last August, Niccol wasn’t forced to relocate to Seattle and would be provided with a remote office in Newport Beach, Calif. He was also given the use of a corporate jet for work travel.

Niccol does have an office and residence in Seattle that he mostly uses when he’s not visiting coffeehouses and other locations, according to Starbucks.

The move to four days a week is the latest from Niccol as he tries to turn Starbucks around from the inside out. He was hired away from Chipotle last year.

Niccol oversaw a wave of corporate layoffs earlier this year. The company let go of 1,100 corporate employees, more than 600 of whom were based at the Seattle headquarters in Sodo. About 3,000 employees are based at the Sodo office.

While announcing the layoffs, Niccol said the move was an effort to streamline the company’s corporate workforce and create “smaller, more nimble teams.” Hundreds of open roles also disappeared.

Niccol is making his mark in Starbucks cafes as well. He has piloted new ordering systems to get drinks out faster, pumped money into TV and radio advertising, and brought back ceramic mugs. The company also removed the upcharge for alternative milks.

U.S. adults are concerned that tariffs will cause tech product prices to surge, according to a CNET survey released last week

Nearly two-thirds of consumers said they recently bought or plan to buy a tech product soon to avoid higher prices or supply shortages, the survey of more than 2,400 adults found.

Those fears may be warranted, as new reciprocal tariffs against several countries, including tech powerhouses Japan and South Korea, are set to take effect Aug. 1.

Dive Insight:

Consumers have been anxious about tariff-induced price hikes and supply shortages since the Trump administration started a trade war earlier this year. Those concerns have been exacerbated by the unpredictability of U.S. trade policy, including on-again, off-again levies against key U.S. trade partners.

Businesses should view the turmoil as an opportunity to build trust with consumers through clear and transparent messaging across all channels, said Carla Bevins, professor of business communications at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.

“If you are not customer-centered, it can come across as tone deaf or even opportunistic,” Bevins said.

A number of tariffs are slated to take effect Aug. 1, including a 25% tariff on goods from Japan and South Korea alongside 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico.

However, it’s unclear when consumers will feel the full effects of the tariffs, as the pause has given retailers more time to stockpile goods.

In June, more than one-third of U.S. adults reported they had, at some point, felt pressured to purchase goods of any kind due to tariff concerns, a slight decline from March, according to the survey.

Another 17% of consumers reported purchasing items of any kind due to tariff anxiety, according to the survey.

In the tech category, U.S. adults are most concerned that tariffs will raise the prices of smartphones, appliances and laptops. Nearly 2 in 5 consumers reported purchasing or planning to purchase a smartphone, while 33% and 31% said the same for appliances and laptops, respectively.

Some consumers are turning to the secondhand market to save money on electronics, with 17% reporting that they have purchased or plan to purchase secondhand electronics, according to the survey.

Medtronic’s renal denervation (RDN) business is in the early stages of a new project to add a key feature to its minimally invasive hypertension technology as it makes progress on a new catheter design and treats its first patients in a study of multi-organ denervation.

Through what the team calls Project Pulsar, Medtronic has developed a next-generation catheter with a longer length for transradial wrist access instead of femoral access. Radial access is gaining traction for catheter procedures like percutaneous coronary interventions thanks to better outcomes than femoral access.

“We’re trying to head down the pathway of a wrist-based approach to doing renal denervation, because we know from the coronary perspective it’s safer with less adverse events for patients. They’re able to go home sooner. You don’t have that potential for femoral bruising or leg bruising,” Fontana said.

“Renal denervation is an incredibly safe procedure,” he later continued. “In all our clinical trials and clinical studies, there’s been very few adverse events. The general risks of the procedure, I would put into the same categories as any interventional procedure. The risks are more related to the procedure access than anything else. In an anything-that-could-happen world, the fear going into this was whether there would be any stenosis of the renal artery or impact to the renal artery. We’ve seen pristine safety from a restenosis perspective.”

Feedback has been positive from physicians using the Symplicity Spyral catheter for RDN and in the multi-organ study, Fontana said. The catheter can expand enough to treat both the renal and hepatic arteries, so there won’t be significant changes to the therapeutic end of the catheter.

“The performance of the catheter has been really fantastic across the board: utilization, deliverability, it’s been great,” he said. “[At Medtronic, that’s] been something that we’ve been proud of forever with our stents, balloons and guides.”

Medtronic’s Project Gemini

Medtronic’s Spyral GEMINI pilot program (an abbreviation for Global pilot study of rEnal and hepatic coMbINed denervatIon) is comparing RDN against denervation of the arteries in both the kidneys and the liver.

“We’re trying to take more variability out of the conversation,” Fontana said. “There’s always variability with the patient, and we’re trying to get bigger drops in blood pressure and/or more response. Our approach to doing that is to lower the sympathetic nerve activity in the kidney, and then the next big area is the liver. … We did the preclinical work and we presented at ACC that [exactly] that happened: If you add hepatic to renal, you get bigger drops and tighter drops in norepinephrine, the signal from the kidney. We had all this preclinical work, we knew we could do it safely, we knew our algorithm was designed for the hepatic artery, and now we’ve had our first patients.”

“This is kind of a pilot design because it’s never been done before,” he continued. “It’s the first time we’re we’re putting our catheter into the hepatic artery in a human. We have an off-med trial and we have an on-med trial, and we’re basically using the datasets we’ve created as our backdrop to compare this approach to.”

Medtronic has tweaked its RDN generator’s energy delivery algorithm for the multi-organ denervation procedure.

“What we’ve learned preclinically is that the common hepatic artery is made up a little bit different than than your renal artery for appropriate reasons — it’s a different organ,” Fontana said. “We adjusted the algorithm for the tissue we’re going to be delivering energy to in the liver. It’s a little bit thicker of a vessel wall, it’s got a little bit different adventitia.”

Medtronic is using two separate generators in the multi-organ study, but they’re working to offer both energy algorithms in a single generator, Fontana said.

The multi-organ approach offers a lesson for other device developers.

“At a macro level, if you’re an engineer, you tend to get focused on your one area,” Fontana said. “We were focused on the kidney and sympathetic activity in the kidney, and literally the liver has been staring at us the entire time. Every patient we’ve ever treated, it’s right there, and you realize there’s so much sympathetic activity in the liver that maybe we weren’t thinking about. Then you understand it, you learn more about it and realize you can take that opportunity. We learned there was sympathetic nerve activity there — it’s obviously there for a reason — and we’re able to take advantage of it. So if you’re an engineer, you may be focused on that one thing, but every once in a while, pull back a little bit and just see what you’re doing and where else it could be done or where else it could be applicable.”

Medtronic’s Project Galileo

As Medtronic moves forward on Project Pulsar and Project Gemini, there’s a new space-themed program in the works in Ireland. Project Galileo will try to find a signal of intraprocedural efficacy so the physician knows the job is done, Fontana said.

“That’s looking at changes in constriction of the vessels, both pre- and post-renal denervation,” he said. “… Think of it like mapping for atrial fibrillation. … With renal denervation, we treat and then we look to the blood pressure. If there was a way that we could do our treatment and then check and say, ‘OK, we got all the nerves, we’re done,’ that’s what we’re at the beginnings of right now with Galileo. … You’d want to use the same catheter, but use a different energy level and then measure an impact.”

While the Medtronic RDN team’s focus is on hypertension for now, there’s potential for multi-organ denervation to treat other conditions like diabetes.

“There’s some interesting cardiometabolic options that potentially down the road could be addressed,” Fontana said. “… We’re focused on making sure we can do a safe and effective procedure, and then the next steps will follow.”

We asked whether RDN can help Medtronic remain the world’s largest device company after separating from its diabetes business.

“Unfortunately, hypertension is a really big problem around the world,” he said. “… Our diabetes separation is about focus in both areas. We know diabetic patients need focus, and our team has done a great job there. The partnership with Abbott, everything we’re doing, that’s going to really drive focus there. And then on our side and on the Medtronic side, RDN, pulsed-field ablation, tricuspid, mitral, even in the cardiovascular space, there are these big areas of opportunity that now we can heavily focus on. And then if you think about Hugo and surgical and [neuromod], Medtronic’s been able to now really double down on some of these big areas. RDN for patients with hypertension has that opportunity to be one of these growth-drivers going forward.”",https://www.medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Medtronic-Symplicity-Spyral-renal-denervation-catheter-hand.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:03.478748

Dive Brief:

Starbucks will require corporate employees to come into the office four days a week starting in October, the beginning of the brand’s next fiscal year, the chain said in a Monday letter from CEO Brian Niccol.

The chain extended its in-person requirement from vice presidents to now encompass all support center people leaders. They must be based in the Seattle or Toronto offices within the next 12 months.

In March, Starbucks laid off 6.9% of its non-cafe workforce and required many leaders to return to in-person work.

Dive Insight:

This latest policy change comes more than two years after Starbucks began shifting corporate employees back to in-office roles, a decision that at the time pushed some corporate employees to petition the coffee giant to abandon RTO policies and sign an election agreement with Starbucks Workers United.

Starbucks will continue to maintain some in-market corporate roles and will not require “individual contributors to relocate,” according to the letter. However, future hiring for corporate roles — and lateral moves within the company — will require workers to be based in the Seattle or Toronto areas.

Niccol framed the latest increase in RTO requirements as a way to reestablish “our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together.”

However, Niccol said that employee’s “work may take you outside the office, including visiting stores, meeting suppliers, or other business travel. You should continue to go where you need to go to be successful.”

Workers can leave early or step out for pressing appointments and other personal matters, he added.

Starbucks will offer a one-time cash payment for workers who decide to leave the company rather than return to office. Niccol said the company would share more details on the voluntary departure package with employees soon.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/I8NdrngnsgfNxMN98ZxlCH0hc5hM2B0n82Sm0tSn7Yk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTU5ODY3MjQwX2dhYkxCbVouanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-14 18:08:11.327844

How Philips Improved Image Management?","Navigating the sea of visual content is a growing challenge for companies that rely on marketing campaigns. For businesses like Philips, streamlining their image libraries with AI solutions offers a reprieve from manual sorting, while enhancing brand consistency. The collaboration between Philips and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud’s Vertex AI underscores a push toward faster and more efficient digital asset management in the corporate world, reflecting a broader trend in utilizing technological advancements to solve practical issues.

During past years, Philips faced significant hurdles in organizing and maintaining a cohesive image library due to the sheer volume of content. Although systems like traditional metadata management strategies were frequently employed, they often led to disconnected or outdated results when image variants were modified. However, other companies leveraging AI find similar advancements advantageous in reducing operational backlogs, which historically slowed down marketing campaigns.

How Philips Improved Image Management?

Philips tackled the issue by deploying a custom algorithm that employs computer vision through Google Cloud’s Vertex AI. This approach enabled the company to sort out 8,000 high-quality images from a pool of 200,000 in mere hours.

“Properly managing the life cycle of these assets is critical,” said Claudia Calori, Philips’ head of marketing excellence.

Such utilization of computer vision allowed them to identify similarities based on core visual features without resorting to outdated metadata.

What Advantages Does the AI Offer?

This automated process not only saves substantial time but also enhances the accuracy and quality of image selection. By modernizing their digital asset management, Philips aims to mitigate compliance risks and ensure that marketing materials are coherent and compliant across various channels. Thereby, they focus more on creativity and strategic initiatives. AI supports additional functions like faster testing and efficient campaign launches, which optimize marketing operations.

The technology delves deeper into the visual makeup of images via embeddings, which are mathematical representations of an image’s features like shapes and patterns. As businesses increasingly embrace AI, such systems present significant advantages over manual handling, allowing for a sharper focus on innovative product and service designs.

Developers’ integration of this technology as a tool for creativity highlights an evolution in corporate strategy. Large-scale companies are now more poised to maintain brand integrity while channeling efforts into future technological enhancements.

“Using image embeddings, the system delivers instant results, even scanning hundreds of thousands of images,” Calori noted.

This shift towards adopting AI for managing digital assets reflects wider efficiency gains across the industry.

Beyond addressing the immediate organizational challenges, Philips’ transition to AI-managed assets sketches a potential path in transforming marketing content strategies for other enterprises as well. By automating intensive processes, companies can foster stronger consumer engagement and trust, maintaining brand consistency.

Looking ahead, the integration of AI into areas like asset management will likely grow, bearing implications for various industries striving to harmonize large data sets for enhanced operational results. Businesses might encounter fewer bottlenecks, seeing improvements in compliance and the agility of marketing campaigns due to these technological advancements.",https://finance.coin-turk.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/business-012-6.png,N,,2025-07-14 20:03:51.709604

The company’s directors have warned that, without timely solutions, they may have no choice but to implement operational measures to prepare for an earlier-than-expected closure of the Longs Business.
With imports now constituting over 35% of apparent steel consumption in South Africa, the operational integrity and future sustainability of Amsa—and the entire domestic steel sector—appear precarious.","ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa) is staring down the barrel of a difficult period as it prepares for the potential wind-down of its Longs Business—an option that could be realised far ahead of the previously indicated September 30, 2025 deadline. This sobering outlook comes amid ongoing struggles attributed to governmental infrastructure deficiencies and policy missteps that continue to burden the steel producer.

This announcement, made shortly after Amsa forecast slightly reduced headline earnings losses for the six months ending June 30, provoked a sharp reaction from investors. On Monday afternoon, the firm’s share price plummeted by 7.89% to 105 cents on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, a stark decline from over R5 a share just three years ago. The market’s cautious response underscores growing concerns around the company’s sustainability.

Earlier this year, on March 31, Amsa had temporarily deferred its initial plan to wind down the Long Steel Business, seeking leeway until September 30 after securing a R1.68 billion funding facility from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). However, despite these measures, the facility is now fully drawn and Amsa confirmed that it would continue operations through the third quarter while honouring commitments to its customers.

The company’s directors noted with concern that “limited” progress has been made in addressing significant structural issues during this deferral period. An influx of high imports continues to saturate the domestic market, compounding the burden on Amsa’s operations. Moreover, Transnet’s rail performance has hit record lows, forcing the company to shoulder elevated operational risks and mounting costs.

Challenges plaguing Amsa have persisted over several years, ranging from structural distortions exacerbated by the Preferential Pricing System and export taxes favouring scrap-based steelmakers, to policies that fail to provide adequate protection against imports. Additionally, persistent circumvention of tariff protections by local companies, coupled with a lack of prosecution, has further complicated the industry landscape.

Adding to these woes, Amsa has reported a series of rail service interruptions triggered by an unprecedented wave of cable theft and locomotive failures, which jeopardised operations at its blast furnaces and necessitated unplanned road transport. This decision has incurred an extra R317 million in direct and operational costs during the current reporting period, compounding the already strained financial situation.

In the midst of these operational hurdles, Amsa has been exploring various strategic options since March, while the IDC continues to conduct due diligence and the government seeks structural interventions. The company’s directors have warned that, without timely solutions, they may have no choice but to implement operational measures to prepare for an earlier-than-expected closure of the Longs Business.

Despite these challenges, Amsa has projected a 15% improvement in earnings per share, expecting a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 for the six months ending June 30, a modest reduction from last year’s loss of R1.09 per share. The full details of this interim performance are set to be disclosed on July 31.

As the global steel industry grapples with a cyclical downturn that has lasted almost two years—a duration notably longer than the norm—Amsa is not immune to these market forces. According to the World Steel Association, global crude steel production dipped by 1.3% from January to May 2025 compared to the same period last year.

Domestically, the economic landscape remains bleak. With all sectors, barring agriculture, contributing to a dim annual GDP outlook, Amsa finds itself grappling with sluggish demand in key steel-consuming industries like construction, automotive, and mining. Sales volumes for flat steel products are being adversely affected by high volumes of imports, while uncertainty around the future of long steel products continues to hinder sales projections.

With imports now constituting over 35% of apparent steel consumption in South Africa, the operational integrity and future sustainability of Amsa—and the entire domestic steel sector—appear precarious. The steel and manufacturing industries recently expressed their disillusionment with government policies in front of the portfolio committee responsible for trade, industry, and competition, further signalling a call for immediate and effective reforms.",https://newsnote.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ArcelorMittal-South-Africa-s-net-asset-value-per-share-of-R5-91-was-down-by-42-Picture-Supplied.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 22:59:30.357962

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company’s back-to-office mandate will increase from three days a week to four days a week for corporate workers as part of his Back to Starbucks transformation plan.

The shift — which will require most corporate employees to work in the office Monday through Thursday starting in October — follows in the footsteps of other major American companies like Disney, Ford, and Intel that have implemented similar mandates in the past couple of years.

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture. because we do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in a press announcement. “We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”

The shift will begin at the beginning of Starbucks’ fiscal year in October, and applies to the Seattle and Toronto Support Centers as well as North America regional offices. Additionally, remote workers at the vice president level and up and support center leaders will need to make plans to move to the Seattle or Toronto area. Also, future hires and lateral moves within the organization will need to be Seattle or Toronto-based.

For employees who wish to opt out of this new mandate, the company is offering a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment option.

“We understand not everyone will agree with this approach,” Niccol said. “We’ve listened and thought carefully. But as a company built on human connection, and given the scale of the turnaround ahead, we believe this is the right path for Starbucks.”

The removal of artificial dyes by industry leaders is rapidly setting new expectations for ingredient transparency and marketing accuracy across the CPG sector.","The regulatory landscape for consumer-packaged goods (CPG) brands is shifting, with artificial food dyes emerging as a central focus of both state and federal scrutiny. Recent actions by the federal and state governments, most notably in Texas, have placed a spotlight on the marketing and labeling practices of major food manufacturers, particularly those making claims about the absence of artificial dyes or the healthfulness of their products that include artificial dyes. This heightened attention is not limited to a single company or product category, and it signals a broader trend that could reshape compliance expectations and litigation risk across the food and beverage industry.

The significance of this development lies in its potential to trigger a wave of regulatory investigations, consumer class actions and reputational challenges for brands that market products as ""healthy,"" ""natural"" or ""free from artificial additives"" while still using synthetic dyes. As public health authorities and consumer advocates intensify their calls for transparency and reformulation, CPG companies should reassess their ingredient disclosures, marketing strategies and risk management protocols to navigate this evolving landscape.

Texas Targets Artificial Dye Use in Food Products

Following the announcements by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Food and Drug Administration of their plans to phase out artificial dyes in U.S. food products, Texas launched investigations into the use of artificial dyes by various large CPG companies based on potential violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, these companies may have misled consumers by marketing products as ""healthy"" and artificial dye-free while still containing synthetic dyes such as Red 40 and Yellow 6. The regulatory focus is not limited to explicit ""no artificial dyes"" statements. Broad health-related claims such as ""'good source of vitamins and minerals,"" ""healthy,"" ""all natural"" or other clean label claims will be under scrutiny if those products contain artificial dyes.

The Texas investigations are significant not only for their immediate implications for the targeted companies being investigated, but also for their potential to set a precedent for how similar claims are evaluated and enforced across the food and beverage industry. These actions underscore the importance of rigorous internal controls, transparent ingredient disclosures and substantiated marketing practices for brands operating in an increasingly scrutinized regulatory environment. Any disconnect between marketing claims and actual ingredients can expose brands to both regulatory and civil actions.

Industry Reaction

Following federal and state pressure, major brands have announced plans to remove artificial dyes from their U.S. product lines. On June 18, 2025, Kraft Heinz and General Mills announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products sold in the U.S. Both companies have stated that they will phase out FD&C artificial dyes by the end of 2027. General Mills also stated that it will be prioritizing the removal of such dyes in its cereals sold in K-12 schools by summer 2026. And Kraft Heinz will not launch new products in the U.S. that include FD&C colors moving forward. The removal of artificial dyes by industry leaders is rapidly setting new expectations for ingredient transparency and marketing accuracy across the CPG sector.

Takeaways

These federal mandates and state investigations mark a significant escalation in regulatory and legal risk for CPG brands making ""good for you,"" ""natural"" or other health claims, particularly marketed to children. Companies face increased exposure to class actions and consumer lawsuits alleging false advertising and mislabeling, particularly where independent testing contradicts marketing claims. Companies should review product formulations, marketing statements and compliance protocols to mitigate exposure in this rapidly developing area.",https://www.hklaw.com/-/media/images/twittercards/blogs/barbitesblog.png?rev=fe9a958372464941bae81d11b270652a&sc_lang=en&hash=E59ABAAFE7A4A7119E9B83D2D5C9EA17,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:15.705250

The possible splitfirst reported by The Wall Street Journalwould likely leave Kraft Heinz with brands like Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard, while legacy Kraft-branded items would go to the new company. A spokesperson confirmed that the company has been evaluating strategic transactions since May to unlock shareholder value.

Kraft Heinz stock closed up 2.5% on the day; the company currently holds a market capitalization of $31.3 billion. A final decision on the spinoff could emerge in the coming weeks, though plans may still change.

The proposed move echoes Kellogg's (KLG, Financials) 2023 decision to spin off its cereal businesswhich had suffered volume declinesinto WK Kellogg, which was recently acquired by Ferrero for $3.1 billion. Analysts say other packaged food makers could follow suit; the industry faces a tough mix of inflationary headwinds, cost-conscious consumers, and demand for healthier, fresher alternatives.

Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazil's 3G Capital, has struggled in recent years. In April, the company slashed its full-year forecast after a weak quarter; last month, it also halted U.S. product launches involving artificial food dyes after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pushed for regulatory action.

Connor Rattigan of Consumer Edge said the move is part of a larger trend in which consumer packaged goods companies are reevaluating their category exposure; M&A or corporate restructurings may offer a way out, he said; but investors will be watching closely to see whether this is a quick fixor the start of something more strategic.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.finance.gurufocus/a004ddbce557262dd0c06f7ce1e367e7,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:24.381101

“And adoption is achieved when behaviors [change, not just when the features ship].” Adoption in payments follows a U-curve.
Behavioral economists call this “social proof.” “Building the product isn’t the same as building the habit, and that’s where the best ideas can fall short,” Lugo said.
One standout example in payments Lugo cited was Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments platform launched by a consortium of major banks.
“Adoption isn’t a one-time event,” Lugo said.","From QR codes and tokenized wallets to instant settlement networks and blockchain rails, the technological underpinnings of payments are evolving faster than most adjacent sectors.

Yet, for all the feats of engineering, true success in this domain is dictated not by what is possible but by what is adopted. The most lasting innovations in payments can frequently center on a deceptively simple question: Will people actually use this?

“Innovation alone doesn’t create impact. Adoption does,” Dani Lugo, the U.S. payments strategy lead at Bank of America, told PYMNTS. “And adoption is achieved when behaviors [change, not just when the features ship].”

Adoption in payments follows a U-curve. Innovators try first and laggards follow last, but the inflection happens only when the middle masses see the system as mainstream. Behavioral economists call this “social proof.”

“Building the product isn’t the same as building the habit, and that’s where the best ideas can fall short,” Lugo said. “The job of the product team is not to just build what’s possible. It’s to make what’s possible feel natural.”

Designing for Scale Without Losing Simplicity

Understanding that adoption is behavioral leads to the toolkit of behavioral science. The most successful payment platforms in the last decade have not simply been technical marvels; they have been behavioral triumphs.

Technical brilliance is a correlation, not a causation, of widespread usability. One standout example in payments Lugo cited was Zelle, the peer-to-peer payments platform launched by a consortium of major banks.

“Technically it was strong, it was fast, it was secure,” she said. “But at launch, the adoption really lagged despite the strong technical infrastructure.”

Users didn’t understand what it was or how to compare it to existing habits like using Venmo or paying with cash. It wasn’t until Zelle unified its branding across banks and invested in education that adoption took off. That pivot helped the platform surpass $1 trillion in payments in 2024.

“Infrastructure is table stakes, but the adoption truly depends on three Cs: clarity, consistency and confidence,” Lugo said.

Still, in enterprise-scale products, the temptation is to conflate complexity with completeness. But Lugo’s approach flips that logic.

“Simplicity is not necessarily doing less,” she said. “It’s about surfacing what matters most.”

Case in point: Bank of America’s work in Europe on pay by bank, a method allowing users to authorize payments directly from their bank account without card details. Behind the scenes, the back-end mechanics are complex, but what matters most to users is feeling secure and confident.

“Can I check out quickly? Is this safe? Do I know what I’m doing and what I can expect next?” Lugo said.

The Future of Payments Innovation Is Empathetic and Behavioral

As the lines between commerce, content and payments continue to blur, the challenge of adoption will grow more complex. In financial services, where complexity is often assumed as a given, empathy helps product teams build intuitive and relevant experiences.

For example, on CashPro, Bank of America’s digital banking platform for commercial and corporate clients, user feedback inspired several enhancements, including QR sign-in, intelligent transaction search with integrated investigation capabilities, and real-time approvals through the mobile app.

“The goal wasn’t to truly simplify the work [CashPro users] were doing, but to make it more usable and human,” Lugo said. “We respected our users’ time and expectations.”

That respect paid off in the form of increased engagement, faster decision making and deeper client relationships. The shift reflects the broader consumer expectation that business tools should feel as seamless as personal apps.

“Adoption isn’t a one-time event,” Lugo said. “It’s a habit that we build through ongoing empathy, experimentation and evolution of the product.”

Trends Reshaping Product Adoption

As FinTech and payments advance, Lugo said she sees three trends reshaping the future of product adoption: embedded and preemptive experiences; trust by design; and real-time, always-on expectations.

Users expect financial tools to appear contextually — whether in a checkout process, a business platform or a messaging app. But embedded isn’t enough; it must be smart. Through contextual cues like user history, behavior or device type, financial platforms can anticipate preferences, reduce friction and build confidence.

“It’s about presenting the right option at the right time,” Lugo said.

Separately, in an era of digital fatigue and fraud, familiarity and clarity are critical drivers of adoption. When users understand where their money is going and why, trust — and usage — follows. That means that trust is no longer passive. It must be built in through transparent design, intuitive flows and visible safeguards.

“Trust is now an active product feature,” Lugo said.

Ultimately, as the economy becomes 24/7, users expect financial platforms to operate at all hours. This is especially true in the disbursement space. Whether it’s a gig worker getting paid at midnight or a corporate client issuing payments over the weekend, the demand for real-time responsiveness is a business necessity.

“The ability to deliver consistently across channels and time zones isn’t just an operational challenge,” Lugo said. “It’s an adoption imperative.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Dani-Lugo-Bank-of-America.png,N,,2025-07-14 20:03:58.365059

The Wegmans announcement encourages consumers to return the recalled products to a customer service desk for a full refund.
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a recall from Danone.","This summer, one trending debate for the nutrition-conscious is the competition between Greek yogurt or cottage cheese, and which packs the bigger protein punch. For younger-spirited palates that aren’t hungry for either pungent protein, there are options, too. For example, Danone, the biggest dairy manufacturer in the country and maker of Activia, Light + Fit, Oikos, and Dannon, also makes a candy-crunch line of yogurt products that are a little more like dessert.

But before you pack that lunchbox for camp, a Monday press release states that Danone U.S. has initiated a nationwide recall of “all flavors and sizes of YoCrunch products currently in-market.” The company says that it’s working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to pull affected products from store shelves.

The voluntary recall is due to the potential presence of plastic pieces in the products’ dome toppers, which the company says “could potentially cause a choking response.” As the company’s release details: “The plastic pieces are transparent, may have sharp edges, and could present a risk to consumers because some pieces are between 7 and 25 [millimeters] in length.” That’s quite small and could be easy for a hungry or distracted eater to miss. Some G.I. experts might add that perforation of the digestive lining could also be a concern.

Worth noting is that the press release specifies that the issue is “isolated only to the separately packaged topper and does not impact the separately packaged yogurt.”

Danone shared the following information about the recall, affecting a total of 17 types of yogurt:

YOCRUNCH STRAW W/GRANOLA 6OZ, UPC 46675000105

A full list of lot numbers and expiration dates, along with product photos, can be found in Danone’s press release.

In a recall announcement on its website, Danone advises consumers not to eat the affected products and urges customers to contact the YoCrunch Consumer Care Line for information on refunds at 1-877-344-4886.

Over the weekend, Northeastern grocery chain Wegmans also announced the recall on its own website, though it only lists six flavors that are affected: Strawberry M&M, M&M Vanilla, Cookies n’ Cream, Vanilla with Oreo Pieces, Vanilla Oreo & M&M, and Vanilla with Milk Chocolate M&Ms.

The Wegmans announcement encourages consumers to return the recalled products to a customer service desk for a full refund.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a recall from Danone. Last year, the company conducted a more targeted recall of YoCrunch Vanilla Lowfat Yogurt with M&Ms for containing “undeclared wheat.” More recently, over 75,000 bottles of coffee creamer from International Delight, another brand owned by Danone, were recalled earlier this year due to “complaints of spoilage.”

The key is using image embeddings.
Image embeddings are mathematical representations of an image’s visual features.
This was how Philips’ image library shrank from 200,000 to 8,000 of the best ones in just hours.
The AI also makes it easier to manage the images across all marketing channels.","Philips, a Dutch health technology company, faced the same issue. So it built a solution using Google Cloud’s Vertex AI platform to narrow down 200,000 images into the best 8,000 on-brand images in just hours.

The initiative addressed a long-standing challenge: the need to maintain visual consistency across a wide product portfolio and global digital presence. The volume and variety of content created over time had become difficult to organize and maintain using traditional systems.

“We manage a large volume of proprietary assets, many of which historically weren’t fully centralized,” Claudia Calori, Philips’ head of marketing excellence, personal health, told PYMNTS. “Properly managing the life cycle of these assets is critical to maintaining brand consistency and integrity across every touchpoint.”

Companies like Philips are using artificial intelligence (AI) to gain a competitive advantage, according to a PYMNTS Intelligence report. AI has changed from being a buzzword to a business enabler. In the goods and technology sectors, users said they could accelerate early-stage creativity to support concept development, prototyping and visual design.

Nearly 2 out of 3 product leaders use generative AI to innovate products and services, while 38% use it to generate feedback on the production process. Here, generative AI serves as a “creative partner” in the idea phase that turns weeks spent in cross-functional team alignment to surfacing designs in just one meeting, the report said.

At Philips, developers created a custom algorithm that used a form of AI called computer vision to sort images — bypassing the use of file names, manual tags or metadata, which are file descriptions that are often less precise and can be outdated.

Computer vision enabled Philips to compare and group images based on what’s in the image itself, even if the image is cropped, resized or compressed into a different format. The key is using image embeddings.

Image embeddings are mathematical representations of an image’s visual features. These embeddings capture patterns such as color, shapes, composition and textures for the AI to parse through.

“Using image embeddings, the system compares degrees of similarity between images across multiple databases and delivers instant results, even when scanning hundreds of thousands of images at once,” Calori explained. “It’s a metadata-free approach that’s driven entirely by the visual content itself.”

Bypassing the Metadata

Once the embeddings are in place, the AI then does searches based on visual similarities across Philips’ image libraries.

After similar images are identified, the algorithm puts them into groups. From each group, the best version based on quality or newness is chosen as the “master” image. Duplicates and outdated visuals were discarded. This was how Philips’ image library shrank from 200,000 to 8,000 of the best ones in just hours.

Under the old way, “we relied heavily on metadata to track image variants, but as assets were modified, reformatted or reused, that metadata could easily become disconnected or outdated,” Calori said. Using AI that bypassed metadata saved “significant” amounts of time and improved accuracy, freeing the team to focus on strategy and creativity.

The AI also makes it easier to manage the images across all marketing channels. Any revised versions can be traced back to its source to ensure that only approved images are used. This mitigates compliance risks.

“It also allows us to strengthen and ensure compliance, automates what used to be a manual effort and improves the consistency of the assets we present to our customers and consumers,” Calori said. “Ultimately, this helps drive stronger engagement and trust in the brand.”

The system supports additional use cases as well, such as enabling faster A/B testing, accelerating campaign launches, and curating up-to-date asset collections for marketing teams.

“Marketing plays a key role in how we help people take charge of their well-being,” Calori said. “Managing our digital assets effectively supports that mission. It allows us to tell a more consistent, clear story across all touchpoints.”

Philips said the new AI capabilities not only address current operational challenges but also establish a foundation for future innovation in marketing content strategy.

“This innovation marks a major leap forward for Philips’ asset life cycle management strategy,” the company said in a statement. “By using advanced visual matching, Philips can refresh touchpoints faster, limit compliance risk, and maximize the impact of current and new assets.”

Hundreds of locations in California, including all the remaining Rite Aid stores in Stanislaus County, are set to close.

While the Philadelphia-based pharmacy chain initially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2023, Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy for a second time in May 2025.

In a May 5 news release, Rite Aid CEO Matt Schroeder said the company has been facing “financial challenges, intensified by the rapidly evolving retail and health care landscapes.”

“As we move forward, our key priorities are ensuring uninterrupted pharmacy services for our customers and preserving jobs for as many associates as possible,” Schroeder said in the release.

Here’s when Rite Aid stores will close in Stanislaus County — and what will happen to prescriptions:

What is Rite Aid?

Rite Aid is a national pharmacy chain that began in 1962 as Thrift D Discount Center in Scranton, Pennsylvania, according to the company’s website.

Along with in-store pharmacies, Rite Aid locations sell over-the-counter medications, vitamins, beauty products and household essentials.

Where are Rite Aid locations closing in Stanislaus County? When?

In an earlier round of closures, Rite Aid shut down its location at 1300 West F St. in Oakdale on June 25, followed by its Ceres store at 1830 Mitchell Road, which closed on July 1.

The Rite Aid location at 1707 McHenry Ave. in Modesto closed on July 9.

Rite Aid will close its remaining stores in Stanislaus County later in July.

In Turlock, the Rite Aid location at 653 North Golden State Blvd. will close on Wednesday, July 16, while the store at 1000 West Monte Vista Ave. will close on Thursday, July 17.

Rite Aid will close its last remaining Oakdale location at 1449 East F St., Suite 102, on Monday July 28, while its last remaining location in Modesto will close at 1032 Oakdale Road on Tuesday, July 15.

Although Rite Aid’s official closure list did not include its location at 1935 North St. in Newman, media outlet Westside Connect reported in May that the North Street spot was scheduled to close as part of the pharmacy chain’s bankruptcy proceedings.

As of Monday, July 14, the Newman location was listed as “closed” on Rite Aid’s website.

Where will my prescriptions be transferred?

According to Rite Aid, prescriptions from closing stores will be transferred to nearby pharmacies to ensure patients continue receiving their medications without interruption.

The hospital claims that Blue KC’s selective auditing of the diagnoses is an intentional strategy to minimize its financial obligations.
The lawsuit is seeking a declaratory judgment stating that Blue KC’s clinical validation audit practices breach the provider agreement and violate the law.

The lawsuit, originally filed in Missouri state court in May and moved to federal court on July 2, centers around a dispute over Blue KC’s use of clinical validation audits to retrospectively reject diagnosis codes tied to inpatient hospital claims. Merriam, Kan.-based Shawnee Mission alleges that the audits, performed by third-party vendors, routinely overturn its physicians’ documented diagnoses without meaningful engagement or adequate justification, thereby violating the two organizations’ contract.

The complaint specifically mentions Apixio, a vendor hired by Blue KC in early 2024 to conduct clinical audits after the insurer had previously used another vendor, Cotiviti. According to the complaint, Apixio uses artificial intelligence tools marketed as being able to conduct complex reviews “in minutes, not days,” and has asserted that 60% of inpatient diagnoses are clinically invalid, which AdventHealth called staggering and deeply flawed. The lawsuit alleges that neither Apixio nor Cotiviti consulted with physicians or provided transparency into their qualifications or use of AI in reviewing medical records, arguing that the process bypassed standard medical review safeguards.

AdventHealth is alleging that more than 350 claims involving diagnoses such as malnutrition, respiratory failure, and sepsis were denied, even when supported by patient records and confirmed by providers. The denials are allegedly disproportionately focused on conditions that, when coded, increase reimbursement rates due to their complexity and the resources required to treat them. The hospital claims that Blue KC’s selective auditing of the diagnoses is an intentional strategy to minimize its financial obligations.

The lawsuit is seeking a declaratory judgment stating that Blue KC’s clinical validation audit practices breach the provider agreement and violate the law. AdventHealth is asking the court to require the insurer to pay for denied claims that are documented in medical records and to permanently halt the clinical validation audit process unless performed by qualified personnel in a transparent manner. The hospital is also requesting damages for the alleged underpayments.

“If you don’t like the rates, don’t do the work,” he continued.","Anaesthetists are being paid less for some work than an out of an hours plumber could expect to earn and lower pay is reducing the number of anaesthetists doing private work.

This is according to William Harrop-Griffiths, professor of practice (Anaesthesia) and consultant anaesthetist at Imperial College, London who spoke at the Independent Doctors Federation’s (IDrF) Private Practice Conference.

Pay rates by some insurers for private healthcare treatment have been a major concern for medical practitioners especially over the last two years with the IDrF launching a campaign to rebalance the relationship between doctors and insurers.

Citing the example of emergency laparoscopic surgery, Harrop-Griffiths claimed insurers could pay an anaesthetist anything between £222 and £230 for the two hours’ private work.

While that was less money than a surgeon could expect to be paid, Harrop-Griffiths maintained it was also less money than an out of hours plumber.

“I think we’re worth a little bit more money than an out of hours plumber,” he said.

“The rates for an anaesthetist in the independent sector are far from generous in many, many insurance-related work.”

No-one forces you to do private work

But he conceded there wqas no comulsion for anyone to take on private work.

“Nobody actually forces you at gunpoint to become an anaesthetist,” he continued.

“You only become an anaesthetist if you want to.

“Nobody forces you to do private practice. You do not need to do these things if you don’t particularly want to do.”

Impact of downward pressure on pay rates

Though Harrop-Griffiths warned downward pressure on anaesthetist pay rates has its consequences.

“If you don’t like the rates, don’t do the work,” he continued.

“And if you don’t do the rates, no-one does the work and then the rates will then go up, so I’m not saying we are badly paid,” he added.

“But fewer anaesthetists are entering the world of private practice – partly because of generational changes and lifestyle, but also because the relative rates are going down and down.”",https://healthcareandprotection.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/William-Harrop-Griffiths-e1752484287738.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 20:59:11.189581

Men's personal care: A category in transformation The men's personal care category is experiencing significant growth, outpacing personal care at large, driven by several converging trends.
But men's personal care marketing requires a distinct approach compared to women's beauty marketing, focusing more on outcomes than ingredients.
The vital role of marketplaces Marketplaces play a crucial role in Every Man Jack's ecommerce strategy, offering benefits beyond sales.","Men’s care brand Every Man Jack employs a strategic calendar-based marketing approach that shifts focus throughout the year, responding to consumer behavior and competitive pressures.

“[Our marketing approach] really depends on the time of the year,” said Nick Hasselberg, vice president of performance marketing and ecommerce at men’s care brand Every Man Jack on a recent episode of “Behind the Numbers.” “At the beginning of the year, it’s brand marketing. In the back half of the year, it’s probably a little bit more [about] performance marketing.”

The brand front-loads awareness campaigns at the beginning of the year, recognizing competitors are aggressively generating demand immediately after the holiday season.

""We realized last year that our competitors were not standing pat and really after the holiday focusing intensely on generating awareness and demand,"" Hasselberg explained.

This early-year brand marketing creates a foundation of awareness that the company can leverage in the second half of the year through more performance-focused tactics.

These include rewards programs through partners like Ibotta or Neptune, and increased investment in search marketing to convert aware consumers into customers.

This approach aligns with broader retail trends.

“Nowadays, with the holiday calendars, especially being pulled forward more, it becomes more important to get brand awareness earlier into the year,” said our analyst Sky Canaves.

Men's personal care: A category in transformation

The men's personal care category is experiencing significant growth, outpacing personal care at large, driven by several converging trends.

""Men are increasingly interested in 'better for you' offerings,"" Hasselberg noted, pointing to the rise of clean ingredients in men's products mirroring broader trends.

This shift has been accelerated by social media creating greater appearance consciousness and COVID prompting increased health awareness.

But men's personal care marketing requires a distinct approach compared to women's beauty marketing, focusing more on outcomes than ingredients.

""Beauty shoppers are so much further along the adoption curve. They know what they're looking for. They know what those ingredients are on the back of the bottle,"" said Hasselberg. ""Men still need to be educated. And really for men, it tends to be a bit more outcome focused.""

This education gap means that while ingredient transparency matters, connecting those ingredients to specific benefits is crucial for male consumers who may not understand the significance of components like aloe vera or jojoba beads without clear explanation of their effects.

The vital role of marketplaces

Marketplaces play a crucial role in Every Man Jack's ecommerce strategy, offering benefits beyond sales.

""Marketplaces are vital to this brand's growth. First and foremost, they provide the most consistency in terms of return within marketing, which is essential to planning,"" said Hasselberg.

This consistency helps stabilize marketing performance when other plans encounter challenges.

Marketplaces can also contribute to upper-funnel marketing goals or serve as testing grounds for new products.

“One of our greatest sources of awareness amongst all consumers is seeing us on Amazon or seeing us at Walmart.com,” said Hasselberg.

The brand recently launched a new deodorant on Amazon, using the platform to gather consumer feedback on creative elements, reviews, and purchasing patterns.

These insights can be packaged as proof of concept for approaching wholesale retail partners.

“Reddit is the number one platform for product-related discussions, including health, wellness and beauty,” she said.
The collaboration not only expands CMX’s audience reach but offers brands a chance to tap into the reasons behind purchase behaviors.
“It’s being able to hone in on not just what they purchase, but why they purchase, or maybe even why not, and bring those insights further to our brands,” Walsh said.
“It’s new communities, new ways to engage on discoverability and growth, and it will just yield a lot more transactions for our brands,” Walsh concluded.","CANNES — CVS Media Exchange (CMX), the retail media arm of CVS Health, is teaming up with Reddit to unlock new advertising opportunities for brands, tapping into Reddit’s vast, high-intent communities focused on health, wellness and beauty.

“Our collaboration with Reddit will be available early Q4 of this year,” said Raphaela Walsh, head of product at CMX, during an interview with Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. “We’re super excited to see the results and performance, and based on that beta, we’ll then look to extend it further.”

Walsh said Reddit’s unmatched role in product discovery and conversation, particularly in health and wellness. “Reddit is the number one platform for product-related discussions, including health, wellness and beauty,” she said. “Over 51% of product mentions actually happen on Reddit, so it’s just a powerful, powerful platform.”

The partnership will integrate CMX’s first-party data, including insights from CVS’s ExtraCare loyalty members, with Reddit’s 108 million daily active users across 100,000 communities. Of particular interest are the 700-plus Reddit communities dedicated to health and wellness, which Walsh described as “really unique conversations that are happening with really high intent.”

Beyond scale, Walsh said both companies share a focus on authenticity, transparency and verification. Reddit’s existing partnerships with brand safety platforms such as DoubleVerify and IAS “really checked the box in a critical way that helped us move forward,” she added.

The collaboration not only expands CMX’s audience reach but offers brands a chance to tap into the reasons behind purchase behaviors.

“It’s being able to hone in on not just what they purchase, but why they purchase, or maybe even why not, and bring those insights further to our brands,” Walsh said.

Walsh framed the partnership as part of a larger trend where consumers move beyond traditional social media to seek peer recommendations and meaningful product discussions.

“It’s not just about social anymore,” she said. “It’s where they can consult with peers on topics that are meaningful for them and where brands can deliver highly targeted offerings with measurement.”

The beta launch is set for later this year, with plans to scale pending performance results. “It’s new communities, new ways to engage on discoverability and growth, and it will just yield a lot more transactions for our brands,” Walsh concluded.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/97873-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 16:07:47.022623

Walgreens expects to close the transaction in the third or fourth quarter of this year, subject to the usual closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
The company will continue to operate under the Walgreens, Boots Duane Reade, No7 Beauty Company and Benavides names.
The Wall Street Journal first reported in December that Sycamore was in talks to take Walgreens private.
ON THE RECORD “We appreciate the consideration and overwhelming support from our shareholders in our value-maximizing transaction with Sycamore,” said Tim Wentworth, Chief Executive Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance.","Shareholders for Walgreens Boots Alliance overwhelmingly voted to approve the company’s sale to Sycamore Partners, with 96% of shareholders at a special meeting voting to green-light the merger, estimated at $23.7 billion.

The initial merger announcement was made on March 6, and at that time it was determined that WBA shareholders will receive $11.45 per share in cash at closing, and one non-transferable Divested Asset Proceeds Right to receive up to an additional $3 in cash per share from the future monetization of WBA’s debt and equity interests in VillageMD, which includes the Village Medical, Summit Health and CityMD businesses.

Walgreens expects to close the transaction in the third or fourth quarter of this year, subject to the usual closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

WHAT’S THE IMPACT

Leveraging WBA's healthcare expertise and Sycamore's established leadership in retail and consumer services, WBA will be better positioned to become the first choice for pharmacy, retail and health services, Walgreens said.

The company will continue to operate under the Walgreens, Boots Duane Reade, No7 Beauty Company and Benavides names. WBA will maintain its headquarters in the Chicago area.

The Wall Street Journal first reported in December that Sycamore was in talks to take Walgreens private. The deal was then considered dead.

In February, the sale was considered on again after CNBC's David Faber said on air that the pharmacy chain may be sold to New York-based private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

Walgreens has suffered losses due in large part to VillageMD. Plans for expansion of the primary care network were scrapped as in late 2023, Walgreens announced a $1 billion cost-cutting initiative. This included the closure of more than 60 VillageMD clinics, a number that grew to 160.

THE LARGER TREND

CVS Health has also suffered profit setbacks from operating losses but has been cushioned by its pharmacy benefit manager Caremark, according to Seeking Alpha.

Walgreens has approximately 12,500 locations across the U.S., Europe and Latin America and employs approximately 311,000 people globally.

ON THE RECORD

“We appreciate the consideration and overwhelming support from our shareholders in our value-maximizing transaction with Sycamore,” said Tim Wentworth, Chief Executive Officer of Walgreens Boots Alliance. “With Sycamore’s partnership, we will be better positioned to accelerate our turnaround strategy, further enhance the customer, patient and team member experience and become the first choice for pharmacy, retail and health services.

A smart strategy But don’t worry, anyone who wants the classic Egg McMuffin can still get it.
More than just a product, a cultural evolution The Egg McMuffin isn’t just another item on the menu: it’s part of McDonald’s DNA!","McDonald’s has just announced some changes. Its most iconic breakfast item, the Egg McMuffin (which has been winning over American breakfast tables for over half a century) isn’t going anywhere, let’s be clear, it’s getting a makeover! You and I both know there’s nothing better than an Egg McMuffin breakfast, but market trends are shifting and so are consumer tastes, so Ray Kroc’s favourite breakfast, the founder of McDonald’s, is about to get a new look… and it starts this week!

The goal is to win over new generations, with a spicier, bolder, and more modern version adapted to today’s consumers. Starting July 8, customers will be able to enjoy the new Spicy McMuffin (yummy!) a limited edition that adds the house spicy sauce to the classic recipe. We love it!!

Will it be enough to win the hearts of young spice lovers? It definitely won us over!

The launch is a celebration of the product’s 50th anniversary, but also a clear marketing strategy to keep it alive. McDonald’s has realized that consumer preferences have changed, and that bold, spicy flavours are now the norm, not the exception. Will this move keep the legacy of the Egg McMuffin alive in a world that doesn’t eat breakfast the same way anymore?

A breakfast with history

In 1972, a McDonald’s franchisee named Herb Peterson presented a completely new product to founder Ray Kroc: a breakfast sandwich that combined egg, ham, and cheese in an English muffin. Kroc was hesitant, but after trying it, he was thrilled. The Egg McMuffin became McDonald’s first official breakfast item, opening a new business line and changing the way Americans eat breakfast. Kroc even wrote in his memoirs the three reasons why he liked this breakfast:

He liked the surprise of not knowing what he was going to taste

He was amazed by the presentation and loved the flavour

The Egg McMuffin paved the way in the breakfast market

Since then, the sandwich has remained practically unchanged. But the world has changed, and millennials and gen z are crazy about bold flavours!

Half a century later: new tastes, new generations

Nowadays, consumers don’t just look for speed or convenience. They want bolder, more personalized products with character. And especially among younger people, the love for spicy food has exploded. According to an Instacart survey, 74% of Americans eat hot sauce frequently, and 78% of Gen Z members say they love spicy food. More spice, more flavour, more delicious, don’t you think?

The new Spicy McMuffin

So, since July, all McDonald’s locations across the U.S. will offer three new spicy options: the Spicy McMuffin, the Spicy Sausage McMuffin, and the Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The main difference between them is in the brand’s exclusive spicy sauce, which adds a punch of flavour without changing the base of the product. And if you haven’t tried it, we recommend it because it’s delicious!!

A smart strategy

But don’t worry, anyone who wants the classic Egg McMuffin can still get it. But for those looking for something stronger and different, there’s now a new, eye-catching option. This way, the chain doesn’t risk alienating its most loyal customers while capturing the attention of a new, bolder audience eager to try new flavours!

More than just a product, a cultural evolution

The Egg McMuffin isn’t just another item on the menu: it’s part of McDonald’s DNA! The fact that the chain dares to tweak it, even temporarily, reflects a deep shift in food culture. Traditional breakfast is giving way to more dynamic formats, influenced by globalization, social media, and changing tastes.

They’re also aiming for (free, of course) social media buzz. The Spicy McMuffin won’t just be eaten: it’ll be filmed, shared on TikTok, reviewed on YouTube… It’s a way to keep the brand alive among an audience that consumes experiences!

50 years and still going strong, now it’s reinventing itself too. We’re already looking forward to getting in line to try that bold new flavour, we can’t wait!",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Egg_McMuffin-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:41.746305

(Reuters) -Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said the coffee giant will require many of its employees to work out of office for a minimum four days a week, from the current three, as part of a new policy expected to kick in later this year.

The policy would include common days of work from Monday to Thursday, applicable to Seattle and Toronto support centers as well as regional officers in North America, Niccol said in a message shared with partners on the company's website on Monday.

Niccol, who will complete a year in the job in less than two months, has been steering Starbucks back to its coffeehouse roots by focusing on enhancing in-store experience and reducing dependence on mobile and to-go orders.

""Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever,"" Niccol said.

""We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams,"" he added.

The four-day office work policy is expected to take effect from September 29.

In February, the coffee chain operator asked the remotely working vice president level leadership to begin relocating to Seattle or Toronto. It is now extending this requirement to all support center people leaders, who are expected to move within 12 months.

Starbucks has been accelerating the roll out of new staffing and service model across company-owned North American stores to revive sales growth after struggling in the face of rising inflation and economic uncertainty.

Instead, the hackers won the war with a simple guessing game. McHire, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring chatbot, was configured with the default credentials 123456/123456 to access the administration interface for McHire restaurant accounts. No MFA, no brute-force protection, nothing.

Designed by Paradox.ai and deployed across tens of thousands of restaurants globally, McHire automates much of the company’s frontline hiring, from collecting applications to conducting interviews via a bot named “Olivia.” The chatbot had access to detailed personal information on job seekers across dozens of countries, and yet it appears that the keys to its admin panel required nothing more than the most guessable password in digital history.

This wasn’t an elite attack, and that’s exactly what makes it so troubling. It didn’t involve backdoors, rootkits or polymorphic code. It involved typing “123456” into a login box and making one small tweak to a URL.

From exposed cloud environments to third-party vendor vulnerabilities, today’s cyber threats are becoming more varied and insidious. In this new digital battlefield, safeguarding your perimeter is no longer about firewalls or antivirus software. It’s about identity, integration, and insight.

Passwords Make Everything Leaky as Attack Chains Move From Credentials to Chaos

For decades, enterprise cybersecurity strategies revolved around the notion of a clearly defined perimeter: secure what’s inside, keep the bad actors out. But cloud adoption, hybrid work, third-party tools, and bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policies have fragmented that perimeter into a patchwork of distributed endpoints and unseen attack vectors.

Still, the McHire breach highlights an uncomfortable truth about modern cybersecurity: while companies invest in next-generation technologies, many still fall victim to yesterday’s mistakes. In this case, the most avoidable mistake of all — using a default password — opened the door.

“It’s the tried and true advice that is often given,” Belsasar Lepe, co-founder and CEO of Cerby, stressed to PYMNTS. “Make it easy to turn on multifactor authentication for your end users. Ninety-nine percent of identity attacks are due to a lack of MFA just being turned on.”

One of Amazon’s flagship products, Amazon Web Services (AWS), last summer announced it was pushing ahead with making MFA mandatory for certain users.

Still, part of the problem lies in how technology like McHire is deployed. The McDonald’s franchise system is highly decentralized. Individual restaurant owners, not corporate headquarters, often manage the technology stack that governs hiring, scheduling, and operations. This structure creates opportunities for inconsistency — and gaps. A third-party platform like McHire may be integrated locally, configured quickly, and left largely untouched once operational. That’s how default credentials persist. That’s how no one notices until a researcher stumbles upon them.

McDonald’s did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

Expanding Attack Surface Provides a Blueprint for Exploitation

The deeper issue can frequently lie in how enterprises view cybersecurity, especially when it comes to tools adopted outside traditional IT oversight. AI-driven tools are increasingly being implemented by line-of-business teams: HR, marketing, logistics. They’re seen as software as a service, quick to install, easy to use, and rarely scrutinized. The belief that “someone else” is handling security is pervasive.

PYMNTS reported in September that while businesses have traditionally focused on internal cybersecurity measures, today’s interconnected digital ecosystem demands a more holistic approach.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

Days after declaring victory in his administration’s push to cut regulatory red tape by 25%, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is now looking to artificial intelligence to help push that number even higher.

In an executive order issued Friday, Youngkin announced Virginia will launch the nation’s first “agentic AI” pilot program designed to streamline state regulations and guidance documents. The initiative will scan thousands of pages of agency rules using generative AI to identify redundancies, contradictions and overly complex language — all in the name of efficiency.

“We have made tremendous strides towards streamlining regulations and the regulatory process in the commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Using emergent artificial intelligence tools, we will push this effort further in order to continue our mission of unleashing Virginia’s economy in a way that benefits all of its citizens.”

The move builds on the administration’s broader deregulation campaign, which this week marked a milestone by surpassing a 25% reduction in regulatory requirements across state government six months ahead of schedule. It’s unclear exactly which regulations have been shaved off, and Youngkin’s press officer hasn’t responded to questions about the methodology powering the process.

“The 25% was broken through, and I’m convinced we can get to 35,” Youngkin said Tuesday at an event in Richmond. “It’s about setting targets and hitting them — and then blowing through them and doing even more.”

The new AI pilot, officials say, is a first-of-its-kind effort at the state level. The technology will comb through existing regulations and guidance documents to flag conflicting language, suggest clearer phrasing, and help agencies that haven’t already met or exceeded the 25% reduction benchmark hit the mark. The administration says the tool will also empower agencies to conduct future reviews with greater ease.

“The ‘Virginia model’ for regulatory modernization has become the gold standard across the U.S., with other states and federal agencies looking to replicate our reforms,” said Reeve Bull, director of the Office of Regulatory Management.

A Youngkin spokesman told The Mercury on Friday that artificial intelligence has not played a role in reaching the initial 25% cut. But officials say the new pilot will “supercharge” the process — especially for agencies still struggling to hit the original target.

As of this week, Virginia agencies had eliminated 47.9% of the words in their guidance documents and streamlined 26.8% of the regulatory requirements on the books, the administration said in a news release, emphasizing that most agencies are on track to meet or exceed the 25% goal, while a handful may need an extra push — potentially from AI.

“The Office of Transformation continues to look for ways to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our state government,” said Chief Transformation Officer Rob Ward. “We look forward to working with our Office of Regulatory Management to apply the power of AI to our regulatory environment.”

Youngkin has tied the regulatory rollback to what he views as broader economic success in Virginia. At Tuesday’s event inside a sweltering Southside Richmond warehouse, he rattled off investment and job creation numbers alongside regulatory cuts — $120 billion in new business commitments, 270,000 new jobs, and 15,000 high-growth startups.

“Today is about results,” he told supporters and business leaders. “Today is about commitments kept. Today is about promises made — and a team of extraordinary individuals working together to keep those promises.”

The reform effort stems from Executive Order 19, signed in 2022, which launched a sweeping, government-wide audit of regulations, permitting practices, and guidance documents. That process has resulted in the streamlining or repeal of nearly 89,000 individual requirements, officials said.

Among the most visible impacts are regulatory timelines at the Department of Environmental Quality that have reportedly dropped by 65%, while the Virginia Department of Transportation has cut 20,000 regulatory items.

In housing, Youngkin said updated building code rules reduced the cost of constructing a new home by nearly 6%, saving homebuyers roughly $24,000. Brian Horn, at the time director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, led the charge on that front, streamlining more than 48,000 housing-related regulations.

Environmental regulations were also a target. Andrew Wheeler, former EPA chief under President Donald Trump and now a key architect of Virginia’s regulatory review system, said his office found that more than half of all regulations had been drafted by agencies without external review. He highlighted stormwater regulations as one area where the volume of rules was drastically reduced — from 23 inches of printed materials to just five.

Still, Youngkin has emphasized that the effort wasn’t about cutting corners. “We’re not saying all regs are bad,” he said. “What we’re saying is excess regulation is bad.”

To track agency progress, Youngkin told reporters that the administration has been using a color-coded dashboard — green for those ahead of schedule, yellow for those close behind, and red for laggards.

And as Virginia eyes a new 35% reduction target, the AI pilot is expected to help maintain momentum across the board, the administration said.

Federal funding to Planned Parenthood facilities in Virginia and across the nation are tied up in legal battles for the time being. A provision in Congress’ “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” signed by President Donald Trump last week would block Medicaid payments for services at facilities like Planned Parenthood for up to a year.

Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration over the provision on Monday and a district court judge granted the organization a two-week restraining order against the federal government. On Friday, the Department of Justice called the judge’s order unlawful and asked for it to be withdrawn, saying the judge “didn’t follow procedure and should have given the government’s lawyers time to respond before ruling,” States Newsroom reported.

Judge’s order blocking Planned Parenthood funding ban unlawful, Trump DOJ says

In the commonwealth, about 700 to 800 patients per month use Medicaid to pay for services, said RaeAnn Pickett, communications director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. The organization’s clinics serve around 25,000 patients overall per year at its facilities around the state, she said.

The next set of arguments in Planned Parenthood’s case will occur on July 21 and determine whether a longer pause will be granted. Meanwhile, The Guardian reported that some clinics in the country have posted notices on their websites alerting patients they can no longer accept Medicaid in order to comply with the law.

While the national organization has drawn ire from anti-abortion advocates and many Republicans over the years for ending pregnancies, that is just one of the health care services the group provides. Planned Parenthood clinics around the nation also offer cancer screenings, sexual health testing, contraception and breast exams.

The most recent data from 2023, Pickett said, shows that Virginia’s centers provided contraception to over 12,000 patients, conducted more than 12,000 sexually transmitted disease tests, performed nearly 1,300 breast exams and performed 705 cervical cancer screenings (which yielded 53 abnormal results, prompting patients to seek follow-up care).

“Every cancer that goes undetected, every STI that goes untreated, every patient who can’t get birth control or abortion care when they need it — all of it is on their hands,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia director Jamie Lockart said in a statement as Congress was passing the reconciliation bill.

Federal law has long prohibited Medicaid coverage from funding abortions, save for specific circumstances. The organization emphasizes that targeting Medicaid funding being used in its facilities will actually affect other components of reproductive health care that low-income families rely on.

“The Defund Provision is a naked attempt to leverage the government’s spending power to attack and penalize Planned Parenthood and impermissibly single it out for unfavorable treatment,” the organization said in the filing.

Earlier this year, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia were affected by the Trump administration’s freeze on Title X funding — a decades-old federal program that helps extremely low income families access family planning care at little to no cost. That equaled about 11,000 Virginia patients who were subject to higher costs for care.

In states like Virginia without tight restrictions or bans on abortion, organizations like Planned Parenthood have been a critical access point for travelers seeking abortions.

Pickett said that close to 30% of abortions provided by Planned Parenthood are from out-of-state patients — meaning that about 3,000 people are traveling for care. Overall abortion providers in Virginia have reported a rise in out-of-state patients in recent years, as surrounding states have enacted restrictions or near-total bans on the procedure.

The “big beautiful bill” was passed by both chambers of Congress and last week, President Donald Trump signed it into law, triggering a countdown until sweeping changes to Medicaid take effect, including potential coverage loss for millions nationwide, financial strain to hospitals and new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. While the changes won’t kick in for more than a year, Virginia lawmakers are already preparing for the transformation of the state’s health care landscape.

It’s still unclear exactly how many Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage because final analyses from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) haven’t dropped yet. The uncertainty has left many wondering if they or loved ones will be impacted — and set the stage for partisan bickering.

Democrats have warned for weeks that over 322,000 Virginians could lose health insurance, based on a state-by-state breakdown from the U.S. Senate’s Joint Economic Committee and previous CBO estimates released as the bill made its way through Congress.

What happens to Medicaid in Virginia if massive federal bill to slash billions becomes law?

Gov. Glenn Youngkin said Tuesday that figure is “literally made up,” while other Republicans have pointed to a 7-year-old state study, conducted before Virginia expanded its Medicaid program in 2018, to claim far fewer would be booted from Medicaid.

Clearer understandings of just what will happen to Medicaid in Virginia and other states may be best found in future OMB reports but its most recent estimates found 10.8 million Americans nationwide could lose insurance as a result of the bill.

‘A moving target’

The bill’s rapid race over the finish line, from the House to the Senate to Trump’s desk in a span of mere weeks, could be the root of confusion about its full impact concerning health care, and lawmakers’ differing interpretations. Analysts and organizations tracking the legislation also tried to keep pace.

While the CBO was able to do further analysis on the House version of the bill earlier in the summer, the shortened timeline for the Senate version before passage, paired with a federal holiday has contributed to a lack of final analysis.

Freddy Mejia, a policy director with The Commonwealth Institute, noted the whiplash lawmakers and analysts experienced trying to keep track of the House and Senate versions of the OBBB.

The impact between the two different bills is “kind of a bit of a moving target,” he said.

He plans to keep an eye out for further reports from CBO now that OBBB has fully passed.

On a national scale, Democrats have stressed that the number of Americans facing the loss of their Medicaid coverage could be close to 17 million. This, a CBO spokesperson said, is because the office created another analysis with provisions that weren’t in the bill that passed, but which could also have an effect: expiration of ACA premium tax credits and a proposed Health and Human Services rule for marketplaces.

Beyond just health insurance, CBO estimated that in general, resources would decrease for lower-income households while increasing for middle class and higher-income households. That supposition, however, stems from the House version of the bill, supported by Virginia Republican U.S. Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia Beach and Rob Wittman of Westmoreland, which did not become law. Fresh CBO review could reveal how people in different income brackets will fare with the new law overall.

Old data, new frustrations

State Republicans’ allegations that Democrats’ Medicaid coverage loss estimations were inflated first circulated as the big beautiful bill wound through congress. This week, the debate came to a head with Youngkin accusing Democrats of “extreme assumptions” at an event announcing a slate of regulatory reductions on Tuesday.

“The number that Democrats are throwing around on Virginians who will lose their health coverage is made up,” Youngkin said Tuesday while talking with the media at the event. “They choose extreme assumptions in every measure.”

It’s unclear what data Youngkin is using to refute Virginia Democrats’ Medicaid loss estimates and members of his staff did not respond when asked.

Meanwhile, Republicans in Virginia’s House of Delegates have cited n a 2018 study from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). Garren Shipley, a communications staffer for the House Republican Caucus, shared the study with emphasis that the party doesn’t believe mass disenrollment would happen because of Congress’ bill.

Like CBO, JLARC is a nonpartisan research entity in state government that lawmakers often tap to study various issues. The 2018 JLARC study Shipley referenced came the same year Virginia expanded its Medicaid program.

At the time, JLARC estimated that about 32% of Virginia’s Medicaid expansion population would be subject to work requirements and 7% would be deterred from enrolling or leaving the program due to the requirements.

As the JLARC study is over seven years old, it’s likely some of its estimations are no longer relevant or accurate. What is certain, however, is that changes to Medicaid requirements and hospital funding mechanisms are on the horizon.

Work requirements, risk to hospitals

Youngkin also framed the work requirements as an important part of Medicaid reform. It’s something state lawmakers had initially considered when expanding the program seven years ago. The new law will require those receiving Medicaid benefits to maintain full-time employment subject to twice-yearly verification, which some lawmakers and advocates say are either unnecessary because many recipients already work, or needlessly burdensome to those living with a disability.

“Redetermination is a really important process,” he said. “It asks us to redetermine every six months, and that gives us a chance to assess who’s gotten a job, (and) who hasn’t complied with the work requirements.”

Youngkin emphasized how Medicaid is supposed to ensure that the “deeply impoverished,” mothers, and children have health insurance rather than able-bodied people “who can get a job and have simply chosen not to.”

Most Medicaid recipients do work, though some like Richmond-area resident Andrew Daughtry, currently do not. A construction worker, he’s tapped into Medicaid for surgeries to recover from an injury that’s left him temporarily unable to work. Earlier this summer he said that it felt “insulting” to have his work ethic questioned.

The twice-yearly employment verification is meant to kick people off their insurance if they aren’t able to keep their jobs while the phase-down of Medicaid provider taxes and state-directed payments are also meant to curb costs for the federal government.

But hospitals warn of heightened chances for closures — particularly in rural areas —- or trimming of offered services and staff. Several hospitals in Southwest and South Side Virginia had already closed obstetrics units, for example, prior to the new congressional bill.

Virginia’s state budget will fund OB-GYN medical residencies amid obstetrics closures

Julian Walker, spokesman for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, reflected on the intent of the Affordable Care Act — a hallmark law of Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency that allowed states to expand their Medicaid eligibility to provide health care to more people to begin with. The law was about keeping people insured and healthy in order to keep everyone’s bills down.

“The impact is not exclusive to the Medicaid population,” Walker said. “It has ripple effects.”

He noted that uninsured people are likely at or closer to poverty levels than insured people. Without health coverage, they’re more likely to put off preventative care or seek treatment for conditions until emergencies arise.

Walker said people’s conditions are likely to be worse by then — requiring more resources between staff, medications, treatments and length of stay in a hospital. Longer stays mean less available beds for others, regardless of Medicaid status.

Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine, remained vocal on social media throughout the reconciliation process to warn that some hospitals would be strained and likely to close. Sometimes, he tagged Virginia’s congressional Republicans, whose districts include rural hospitals and sizable amounts of Medicaid patients.

Hospitals are also federally required to provide care regardless of whether someone can pay their bills or not, so they absorb that cost while also trying to offset it. As hospitals periodically negotiate with private health insurers, Walker said rates will likely go up for employers and employees with private insurance.

“Different constituencies may feel the impacts differently,” Walker said. “Some more than others — but this has potential to have much more far-reaching implications.”

In the wake of deadly flooding in central Texas and New Mexico that claimed over 100 lives with nearly 200 still missing, scrutiny of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which provides disaster recovery services and funding, has mounted.

Before the floods, the federal government had announced plans to eliminate or remake the agency and is now reviewing its procedures, funding, and execution of agency missions, a process in which Virginia’s governor is taking an active role.

Virginia agencies assist Texas flood recovery, share how state prepares for dangerous weather events

As part of an executive order from President Donald Trump, the FEMA Review Council is analyzing the emergency response agency for potential changes or reductions. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was appointed to the council and now serves on a subcommittee that will report on the roles of localities and other agencies outside of FEMA when it comes to disaster response.

The goal is to create better communication and to put more of the recovery responsibilities on the shoulders of the states.

“We will be receiving inputs from governors, from local leaders, from emergency response personnel, and, of course, from the review council itself,” Youngkin said. “I think we will be able to chart a very clear delineation of the way things work today,” Youngkin added, noting the “deep challenges” of FEMA’s current system and the group’s goal to “shift responsibility to the states and therefore move FEMA from being a supplant role into a support role.”

Traditionally before disasters, FEMA promotes emergency preparedness and provides the National Flood Insurance Program. They also help stage resources in areas where a known storm such as a hurricane is headed towards.

During an event that received a presidential disaster declaration, the agency helps provide recovery centers to disseminate resources as well as funding application locations across the affected areas. The agency works with local and state resources to aid affected communities in the immediate and long-term aftermath of a disaster.

Following Hurricane Helene last year, Virginia was awarded over $18 million from FEMA for individual and household programs. However, low-income families did not often meet the threshold for FEMA funding, leaving them in the lurch when trying to build back their lives. The agency has drawn the ire of Trump and other Republicans, despite some analysts and state officials framing FEMA as a critical resource whose assistance states would likely not be able to replicate on their own.

“Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, FEMA has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,” Trump said in his executive order establishing the review council.

Youngkin said in his statements to the council on Wednesday that during the response to devastating flooding it was unclear what FEMA would provide in addition to other federal agencies.

“How do we move forward with haste in order to meet our citizens’ needs when we don’t really even know how much the resources are going to be to provide the answers to the basic needs of housing, food, and recovery. This is the work that we are undertaking,” Youngkin said.

FEMA has had to deal with a growing number of high-dollar disasters across the country leading to strained services and slower response times. That is on top of reductions in funding from the federal government under the second Trump administration, which have impacted flood resiliency projects, National Weather Service staffing, and other programs in Virginia.

As mandated by the executive order, the council’s final report will include a review of FEMA’s disaster response in the last four years, comparing FEMA’s response to how local and state agencies responded to the same disasters, what programs were in place before FEMA, and how the agency can be more of a support than the main response to disasters.

The order does not explicitly state when a final report is due, and a date wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s meeting, but the council is only ordered to exist for one year.

The newly formed joint commission tasked with overseeing Virginia’s transition to a legal retail cannabis market held its inaugural meeting in Richmond Wednesday, launching what lawmakers described as the next chapter in the commonwealth’s winding path toward a regulated marijuana industry.

Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, who sponsored the House resolution creating the commission earlier this year, was elected chair during the meeting at the state Capitol. While no other formal action was taken, the panel laid out its mission and signaled it would use previously vetoed legislation as a foundation to craft a new proposal for 2026 — when Virginia will have a new governor.

“Our goal is to create a successful approach to cannabis that’s rooted in protecting the public, the principles of restorative justice, economic equity and public health,” Krizek said in his opening remarks.

“The need is to regulate, control, and tax marijuana, to generate significant revenue dedicated to community reinvestment, create hundreds of new, small local businesses, strengthen Virginia’s vital agricultural sector, and end the racially disparate impacts of prohibition.”

The commission, which was established through House Joint Resolution 497 without needing the governor’s signature, is set to operate through July 1, 2028. It will serve as a forum for public engagement and legislative planning, aiming to build consensus on cannabis policy amid shifting political dynamics in the state.

Krizek noted that although the effort to legalize retail cannabis has faced repeated setbacks — most notably from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s vetoes — the groundwork is already in place.

“We’ve already been pretty successful,” he said. “We’ve made some big progress, and this will be the final capstone on that progress.”

A blueprint already written

In March, Youngkin vetoed House Bill 2485 — legislation sponsored by Krizek and backed by lawmakers from both parties that would have established the framework for a licensed and taxed cannabis market. The identical Senate version, sponsored by Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, passed with bipartisan support as well.

The legislation would have authorized adult-use retail sales starting May 1, 2026, with licenses for cultivation, processing, testing, and retail set to be issued as early as September 2025. It included a microbusiness license tier aimed at lowering entry barriers for historically disadvantaged entrepreneurs and implemented a seed-to-sale tracking system to monitor all commercial activity.

Youngkin’s vetoes take another hit on cannabis reform in Virginia

A projected $87.8 million in annual tax revenue by 2031 was to be allocated across public priorities: 40% for early childhood education, 30% for equity reinvestment, 25% for substance use treatment and 5% for public health.

But Youngkin rejected the measure, saying it would endanger public safety and contribute to negative social outcomes, including “increased gang activity,” impaired road safety, and “adverse effects on children’s and adolescents’ health.” He argued the bill would not eliminate illegal sales or guarantee product safety.

Youngkin also vetoed related bills, including proposals to expunge or reduce sentences for marijuana-related offenses, and a bill to prevent legal cannabis use from being used against parents in child custody cases. Reform advocates decried the vetoes as a continuation of policies that ignore the realities of marijuana use in Virginia.

Legal, but still in the shadows

Virginia made headlines in 2021 as the first Southern state to legalize small-scale possession and home cultivation of cannabis. But despite legalization, no retail infrastructure was ever implemented, leaving the state in a legal limbo. Cannabis remains readily available — just not regulated, tested, or taxed.

“We know that marijuana is being sold in this commonwealth,” said Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, who helped legalize personal possession and now sits on the commission. “And thanks to Governor Youngkin’s veto pen, the way it’s being sold is with illegal, un-taxed enterprises outside of the medical program.”

Ebbin urged fellow commission members to keep the big picture in mind.

“My goal is to move sales away from the illegal market on the street corner to behind an age-verified counter with tested products, and I think that’s a goal that most of the members of this commission share,” he said.

Voices from the public

During Wednesday’s meeting, advocates, growers, wellness professionals, and business leaders addressed the commission in a public comment session that highlighted the wide-ranging hopes — and frustrations — of those awaiting a regulated market.

Chelsea Higgs Wise, founder of Marijuana Justice, praised the commission for opening a space for dialogue but urged members to stay grounded in the equity framework laid out in the state’s original adult-use blueprint.

“The 2020 JLARC report was key to be lifted,” she said, referring to the legislative audit report that called for an equitable cannabis market.

“From the public comments, it appears Virginians are unified on wanting broad inclusion within the market versus only benefiting a well-resourced few. There is still much work to be done and we are confident the commission will take this seriously,” she added.

Jason Blanchette, president of the Virginia Cannabis Association, pointed out that the core elements of the legislation have already passed twice — just not survived Youngkin’s vetoes.

“So obviously our hope in representing small Virginia businesses and small farmers … is that we can all come to an agreement at some point here, right?” he said.

That hope was echoed by Thelonius Cook, a farmer on the Eastern Shore and president of the Mid-Atlantic Black Farmers Caucus.

“I’m here to represent the voice of small farmers, and in particular, Black farmers,” Cook said. “Had it not been for the enslaved labor of Africans producing tobacco and the plantations of Virginia, this colony would have not survived, let alone went on to become America. We want to make sure we have an opportunity to participate in this agricultural revolution.”

Jabria Craft, a cannabis wellness coach from Richmond, spoke passionately about moving beyond product hype and fear-based regulation.

“My platform is rooted in helping people build sustainable and informed relationships with this plant,” she said. “Education is either nonexistent or filled with shame at risks, instead of benefits and support. I would like to see Virginia cannabis as an industry that’s centered in education, intention, and equity… and that us Black and brown and queer folks aren’t left behind on a system that was built on their backs.”

A policy puzzle with political stakes

While Democrats are banking on winning back the governor’s mansion in November — with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger as their nominee — the cannabis debate remains far from settled. The commission’s task now is to rework and refine the blueprint for legislation that can be enacted under new leadership.

Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery, a local prosecutor and one of two House Republicans who supported Krizek’s retail bill earlier this year, has publicly advocated for a pragmatic approach to cannabis reform.

“I have been an advocate for common-sense legislation to regulate the adult cannabis market in Virginia,” Obenshain told The Mercury in March.

“I’ll continue working in a bipartisan fashion until we find the right balance on legislation that can keep Virginians safe while also eliminating the confusing legal regime and proliferation of potentially dangerous products that currently exists.”

Yet Youngkin has remained firm in his opposition. His administration warned that legal cannabis use could harm children, deteriorate mental health outcomes, and worsen public safety — claims many advocates reject as overblown or unfounded.

One of the bills Youngkin vetoed, HB 2555 by Del. Rozia Henson, D-Woodbridge, would have allowed incarcerated individuals with marijuana-related felonies before 2021 to seek sentence modifications. The governor said that could apply to people convicted of more serious drug offenses, including fentanyl trafficking, and impose “undue burdens” on courts and victims.

Another vetoed measure, HB 2613 by Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, aimed to prevent courts from using legal cannabis consumption against parents in custody or visitation decisions.

Youngkin argued the bill could “risk exposing children to harm.”

The road ahead

As the commission begins its work, members say they will focus on listening to the public, gathering expert input and refining a proposal that can finally bring structure to Virginia’s cannabis landscape.

Krizek said public engagement would be a top priority in the first year. “The idea will be to craft the best bill possible to reintroduce next session,” he said. “So you know it’s a priority of mine.”

Though the governor’s mansion has served as a roadblock so far, Democrats hope the upcoming election — and a shift in executive leadership — will provide the opening they need to bring a legal retail cannabis system to fruition.

Until then, the panel has its work cut out for it. It is set to meet next on Aug. 20.

After years of inconsistencies and complaints, Virginia has moved closer to revising its process for reporting issues with special education services, aiming to improve the structure and ensure that families receive the necessary services for their students with disabilities.

The issues with the state’s dispute resolution system — an impartial procedure for parents and schools to resolve disagreements over issues with special education services — have created a divide among parents and public school leaders for at least the past five years.

As federal law states, Virginia is required to provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program. Last year, Virginia recorded over 185,000 students receiving special education services during the 2024-25 school year.

Wendy Little, a parent advocating for her son who is autistic, spoke on Monday to the state’s dispute resolution system advisory group as it reviewed a study with findings about the existing system and recommendations for bettering it. Her son’s story was a key inspiration for the formation of the advisory committee through successful legislation to address the system. She called for an overhaul of the current system to resolve problems special needs families face concerning their children’s education.

“There is no resolution,” Little said. “It’s a dispute to the parents and you get nowhere. It’s not only broken, it is completely corrupt.”

A history of noncompliance

The system, which has been studied for the past five years, has been criticized by parents and advocacy groups for failing to monitor and respond to complaints raised by families. The situation reached a critical point when the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) was investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which looked into why the agency had failed to resolve complaints.

“The time for continued study should end, and focus should turn to implementing the many reforms that have been offered throughout the years, and in this study,” said Deusdedi Merced, managing member for Special Education Solutions, LLC, which conducted the July 1 study. “The time to address the concerns of many is now. Only then will the full breadth of the protections afforded to students with disabilities on the (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) will be realized.”

The report’s findings highlighted that dispute hearing officers did not meet standard legal practices. It also noted a public perception that VDOE has not effectively enforced the outcomes of investigations related to state complaint orders.

The findings align with a 2020 study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), which analyzes and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, regarding K-12 Special Education.

In that report, researchers identified significant shortcomings in the state’s provision of special education services, including low-quality Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) — customized learning plans for student’s disabilities — a lack of knowledge among educators about how to effectively support students with disabilities, and shortfalls in VDOE’s oversight of local divisions.

JLARC’s study also found that the VDOE does not require school divisions to carry out corrective actions that fully and appropriately remedy instances of noncompliance.

The state education agency began turning things around starting with the Board of Education updating Virginia’s regulations on due process on March 28, 2024. Last December, the Office for Civil Rights wrote a letter closing its findings and requirements against VDOE.

Next steps

Some of the draft recommendations the advisory group will be voting on to improve the system include training for all stakeholders compared to a select few, expanding data collection and improving special education mediation.

Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, chair of the Virginia Commission on Youth, said she hopes the draft recommendations will provide more standardization of the IEP process, better training across the system for the mediators and the hearing officers, and increased clarity and support for parents. Favola, along with Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, carried legislation to overhaul special education in 2024.

“We’re trying to bolster the system in a way that makes it more responsive to the parents and ensures a certain amount of quality across the state and I think that’s going to be the message in the report that we go forward with,” Favola said.

But some committee members, including Favola, expressed concern about whether the recommendations could be met, considering the threat to resources and programs posed by federal funding cuts. VDOE Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said the agency will provide details about some of the cost impacts to special education at a future meeting.

The advisory group invited comments from the public, some of whom urged the committee to consider recommending a $10,000 cap on awards for parents, schools and hearing officers to reduce litigation costs. They also recommended better enforcement of federal laws, which includes the potential loss of licenses for non-compliance, and consistency across all divisions.

Kandise Lucas, an academic civil rights advocate, and parents also raised concerns about the mistrust the public has in Virginia’s public schools due to inconsistent eligibility determinations for students with disabilities and inadequate training across divisions.

“IDEA is a civil rights law that was created to make sure that children with disabilities are not marginalized; are not thrown away,” Lucas said.

The advisory committee’s draft recommendations will be presented to the Virginia Commission on Youth on Sept. 3, and will be open for public comment until October 15. The commission will vote on these recommendations during its meeting on Oct. 21.

TD Cowen analysts say food-industry megamergers haven't worked

With Kraft Heinz Co. reportedly considering a breakup of its business, some analysts believe more of its food-industry peers should do the same.

TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow, in a research note on Monday, said the company's (KHC) potential split underscores his view that megamergers in the food industry often haven't worked out. He added that companies that focused more deeply on specific products did better than those aiming for a wider range of offerings.

""The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable and snacks) tend to differ,"" he wrote.

Moskow added: ""We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey (HSY)) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.""

Moskow made the remarks after the Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that Kraft Heinz was planning to spin off a big portion of its grocery segment, including many Kraft items. Another company would oversee sauces and spreads, the Journal said.

In response, Kraft Heinz - which sells Kraft Mac & Cheese, Heinz Ketchup, Oscar Mayer meats, Philadelphia Cream Cheese and other products - said it has ""been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,"" but didn't comment further. Shares were up more than 2% on Monday.

Kraft and Heinz merged in 2015, in a deal coordinated by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A) (BRK.B) and private-equity firm 3G Capital Partners. But the combined company has since faced competition, including from higher-end brands, as well as the rising popularity of options geared toward health-conscious consumers. Meanwhile, GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have also reshaped how some people think about their diets.

Moskow, in a note from April, said that the big food companies whose products line most grocery-store shelves raised their prices too much through the pandemic, while sacrificing quality and opportunities to offer more ""premium"" fare.

In Monday's note, he called out other companies that might be better off separating or otherwise shuffling around the brands they already own. He said he would rather see more of that reshuffling than mergers to rein in costs.

""PepsiCo (PEP) and Campbell's (CPB) strike us as the companies with the best opportunity to create value by splitting up,"" he wrote. ""Utz Brands (UTZ) would be a good combination with Campbell's Snacks, in our opinion. Clorox's (CLX) Hidden Valley Ranch brand belongs in the hands of a food company, not a bleach company from our perspective.""

""Conagra (CAG) and General Mills (GIS) both need to continue to shed brands, in our view,"" he added. ""Perhaps there is more news to come on these fronts.""

Elsewhere in the food industry, privately owned Mars Inc. wants to buy Kellanova (K), which owns snack foods like Cheez-Its, Pringles and Pop Tarts. In 2023, Kellanova, which was formerly known as Kellogg, broke off its North American cereal business into WK Kellogg Co. (KLG) This month, WK Kellogg - which makes Corn Flakes and Froot Loops - agreed to be acquired by Ferrero, which makes Ferrero Rocher candies and Nutella.

CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram on Monday also said more food companies could follow in Kraft Heinz's path, assuming a separation occurs.

""Given ongoing sales softness and lackluster equity valuations across the industry, more packaged-food companies may pursue similar strategies to accelerate value creation, especially given limited visibility into when volume sales will return to growth,"" he said.

""While high prices remain a key factor behind the ongoing volume softness, other forces may be at play as well, including the impact of weight-loss drugs (e.g., GLP-1s) and a broader consumer shift toward healthier food choices,"" he continued.

We are in a really good position,” said EGA Spectro Alloys President Luke Palen.
“With this expansion, we will make 120 million pounds a year of high-quality, recycled billet,” said Palen, who said it also helps companies meet environmental goals.

Think 25-foot-long poles of solid aluminum.

The 90,000-square-foot plant gives companies a needed domestic source for the much-in-demand billets at a time when most aluminum in the U.S. is imported and faces a 50% tariff set in June by President Donald Trump.

At the same time, it becomes a much bigger buyer of industrial metal scrap, a new buyer in Minnesota for recycled beer and pop cans and gives Spectro Alloys its first new product line in 53 years.

“So there’s a lot of demand. We are in a really good position,” said EGA Spectro Alloys President Luke Palen.

Because aluminum is used in everything from cars and fighter jets to food containers and America’s ever-expanding energy grid, U.S. demand “approached near record levels in 2024,” said Aluminum Association spokesperson Katie Rosebrook.

Spectro Alloy employs about 150 workers in its original aluminum recycling plant, which makes 28-pound bricks, called ingots, that eventually become parts for Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Polaris ATVs and products made by companies like General Motors, Tesla, Black & Decker and Caterpillar.

The company, which is majority owned by Emirates Global Aluminum in the United Arab Emirates, now is scrambling to add 50 new workers and expects the new billet operation to boost business by 50%, Palen said.

“Their investment (of) $71 million and creating 50 new jobs for the area is a huge impact for us,” said Adam Kienberger, community development director for Rosemount.

The first molten metal recently glided from one new three-story furnace, oozed down chutes and spilled into 26-foot casting cylinders, deep in the floor of the expansion.

Three new rumbling furnaces came from Austria.

Once they had cooled, crane operator Lorenzo Martinez gingerly hoisted 10 billets from the “vertical casting pit” and onto a giant conveyor belt. The load weighed nearly 18,000 pounds.

The billets will be marketed under the RevivAL brand name, a nod to the fact the aluminum came from 250 recyclers.

“With this expansion, we will make 120 million pounds a year of high-quality, recycled billet,” said Palen, who said it also helps companies meet environmental goals. “It will … contribute to a circular economy in our region and throughout the U.S.”

Customers are already lined up for the billets, which will be used to build door frames, stair railings and boat docks besides auto parts and more.

Last week, the first truck load shipped to Crown Extrusions in Chaska, which is working with a dock maker.

The company plans to add more equipment so it can produce other products such as sheet metal alloys.

Since selling 80% of the company to EGA last year, the Palens have sent engineers, technicians, chemists and metallurgists to Abu Dhabi for billet training.

With the new billet plant, Minnesota will no longer have to send all of its curbside-collected aluminum-can scrap to other states for processing. Some of Spectro’s billet alloy recipes will allow for some old cans, in addition to the usual industrial aluminum scrap.

“This is exciting, because it’s not only going to increase the aluminum that’s recycled overall, but it’s the first local outlet for aluminum cans in Minnesota, at least that I’m aware of,” said Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) spokesman Mark Rust. “It is critically important that people understand there’s a reason to recycle. These products really do have value. The more material that enters the market, that adds value to Minnesota’s economy.”

Danone hasn't said when the contaminated YoCrunch yogurts started appearing in stores. However, its list of affected products includes yogurts with expiration dates from July through September. That means any YoCrunch yogurt that's currently on the market is affected by this recall.

The company is working with grocery stores and other retailers to remove the contaminated yogurt from shelves. We don't recommend buying YoCrunch until fresh product appears in the dairy case, but Danone has not yet said when that will happen.

Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services and the soon-to-be extinguished plans cover nearly 5,000 enrollees, as of January of this year.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

A recent study published in Health Affairs Scholar found that payer-operated primary care practices accounted for 4.2% of Medicare primary care services in 2023, up from 0.78% in 2016. Although this payer-provider integration varied significantly by area.

Still, payer-operated practices were the dominant source of primary care in some counties. Overall, 15.1% of the U.S. population lived in counties where payers controlled over 10% of the primary care market by 2023.

Primary care services delivered by payer-operated practices were also especially salient in Medicare Advantage, or MA, at 5.73% nationally, compared to 1.84% in Traditional Medicare.

MA penetration was one of the market characteristics associated with the local level of payer operation of primary care practices, according to the study. In 2022, payers operated 5.5% of the primary care market in counties with above-average MA penetration of over 49% compared to just 1.5% in counties with below-average MA penetration.

The finding suggests that payers are more likely to integrate with primary care practices where MA is more popular, the study's researchers said.

Conversely, payers operated fewer primary care practices in areas where hospital market concentration was high, indicating an unwillingness or constrained ability of payers to own primary care practices in areas with major hospitals.

Payer entry into primary care was also significantly less common in counties with highly concentrated payer markets for employer-sponsored insurance.

Additionally, the study found that Optum, part of UnitedHealth Group, controlled the most primary care services delivered by payer-operated practices.

The study showed that Optum controlled 2.71% of the national primary care market by service volume in 2023. In some counties, though, Optum controlled substantially more of the market, with 10.1% of the U.S. population residing in counties where payers controlled over 10% of the primary care market.

Optum's market concentration was over 40% in several counties, including Snohomish County, Washington, where it was 44.9%, Contra Costa County, California, where it was 40.1% and Clark County, Nevada, where it was 35.8%.

Other payers analyzed in the study included Humana, Aetna-CVS Health, Elevance and Cigna.

This vertical integration of payers and providers could improve care coordination, chronic disease management and value-based care adoption, according to the study's researchers. However, increasing consolidation among payers and primary care providers, in particular, raises serious concerns about competition and access to care, they added.

""One concern is that payer-owned physician practices may be used to optimize risk adjustment coding, increasing government payments to their own MA plans without necessarily improving patient care,"" they explained in the study. ""Vertical integration could also give insurers an advantage over competing health plans by steering patients toward their own services or making it harder for other insurers to contract with their physician groups.""

Consolidation could also lead to higher prices or fewer choices for patients if payer ownership of physician practices leads to less competition in physician markets, they added.

These concerns have prompted regulatory scrutiny, antitrust investigations and increased calls for market transparency. Notably, former UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty testified in front of Congress, receiving criticism about the company's alleged monopolistic activities. Witty reported during the hearing that Optum alone employs about 10,000 physicians, or about 1% of all U.S. physicians, while affiliates employ another 80,000 physicians.",https://www.techtarget.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/Hero Images/healthcare-medical-statistics-stethoscope-adobe.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 15:08:55.333045

“We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we’re together. We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster,” Niccol wrote in the letter.

Niccol said affected workers who choose not to relocate will be eligible for a one-time voluntary exit program with a cash payment.

While many workers grew to enjoy working from home during the pandemic, the call for workers to return to offices full-time has been growing over the past year. Major employers such as Amazon, AT&T and the federal government have required employees to work in company sites five days per week. Competition for fully-remote jobs is fierce.

Starbucks spokeswoman Lori Torgerson said she didn’t have a count of employees who are currently working as “people leaders” or are working remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, but that includes coffee roasters and warehouse staff.

Niccol was not required to relocate to Seattle when he was hired to lead Starbucks last August. Instead, the company said it would help him set up an office near his home in Newport Beach, California, and would give him the use of a corporate jet to commute to Seattle.

Since then, Niccol has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company’s headquarters, Torgerson said.

Membership Dynamics: Medicaid membership dropped 135,000 due to post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations, but Medicare Advantage (MA) membership grew 12.4% YoY in Q1 2025.
Final Stance: - Hold ELV if you believe Carelon's expansion and MA growth can offset margin pressures.
Until margin pressures ease or Medicaid membership stabilizes, the stock may underperform peers in this cost-driven healthcare landscape.","The healthcare sector continues to grapple with evolving regulatory pressures, shifting member demographics, and escalating operational costs. Elevance Health (ELV), a major player in health insurance and care delivery, faces a pivotal moment as it reports Q2 2025 earnings on July 17. While revenue growth remains robust, profit margins are under siege from rising benefit costs, digital investments, and Medicaid membership declines. This article dissects whether ELV's valuation holds up amid these headwinds or if investors should pivot to peers like CVS (CVS) or Boston Scientific (BSX), which exhibit stronger beat probabilities.

Revenue Growth: A Closer Look at Sustaining Momentum

Elevance's Q2 2025 revenue is projected to rise 11.4% YoY to $48.13 billion, driven by strategic acquisitions (e.g., CarelonRx) and premium growth in commercial individual plans. The Carelon division, which includes pharmacy and home health services, is a standout performer, with operating income up 14.1% YoY. However, this growth comes at a cost:

Benefit Expenses Surge: The medical cost ratio (benefit expenses/revenue) is expected to hit 88.4%, up from 86.3% in Q2 **2024. This reflects higher utilization of care and inflationary pressures in areas like prescription drugs and home health.

Operational Overhaul Costs: Investments in digital infrastructure and interest expenses are pushing total operational costs up ~11% YoY, compressing margins.

Membership Dynamics: Medicaid membership dropped 135,000 due to post-pandemic eligibility redeterminations, but Medicare Advantage (MA) membership grew 12.4% YoY in Q1 2025.

Margin Pressures: Why the EPS Estimate Faces Headwinds

The consensus EPS estimate of $9.20 (down 9.1% YoY) hinges on managing these costs. Key risks:

- Benefit Ratio Volatility: A 1% increase in the benefit ratio could reduce EPS by ~$0.37, given ELV's scale.

- Health Benefits Segment Slump: Operating income here is projected to fall 12.4% YoY, reflecting Medicaid declines and margin pressures.

- Competitor Outperformance: Peers like CVS (Earnings ESP +2.06%) and BSX (Earnings ESP +0.88%) have stronger beat probabilities, as highlighted by Zacks' metrics.

Medicaid vs. Medicare: Balancing Act or Structural Shift?

While Medicaid membership dipped due to eligibility reviews, Elevance's total medical membership stayed stable at 45.8 million, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage (MA) and ACA plans. The 60% re-enrollment rate among Medicaid-eligible members using digital tools suggests some recovery potential. However, the Medicaid redetermination backlog—expected to take over a year to resolve—could prolong margin strain.

Investors should note that MA growth, though strong, faces its own risks:

- A False Claims Act lawsuit alleges improper broker incentives in MA sales, which, if settled unfavorably, could disrupt enrollment.

- Slower MA industry growth (3.8% in Q1 2025 vs. 6.5% in 2023) may limit Elevance's upside.

Valuation and Investment Takeaway

Elevance's stock trades at a 14.2x forward P/E, slightly below its five-year average of 15.6x. While the company raised full-year EPS guidance to $32.85+, its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of 0.00% suggest limited upside surprises. Meanwhile, peers like CVS (Zacks Rank #2) and BSX (Zacks Rank #2) offer better beat odds and faster growth trajectories.

Historically, ELV has shown resilience around earnings releases: from 2022 to present, a buy-and-hold strategy yielded a 71.43% win rate over 10 days, with a maximum return of 1.01% on day 58. This underscores the stock's potential to rebound after near-term volatility.

Final Stance:

- Hold ELV if you believe Carelon's expansion and MA growth can offset margin pressures. The stock's historical performance around earnings events—such as a 57.14% 3-day win rate and 64.29% 30-day win rate—supports this stance.

- Consider pivoting to CVS or BSX for safer upside, given their stronger beat probabilities and less exposure to Medicaid volatility.

Elevance's story remains tied to execution in high-growth segments like CarelonRx and managing the Medicaid redetermination tailwind. Until margin pressures ease or Medicaid membership stabilizes, the stock may underperform peers in this cost-driven healthcare landscape.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 17:06:05.262022

Heartbreak Hill Running Co. co-founder Dan Fitzgerald, who’s also a Nike Running coach, said the Pegasus franchise has always sold well in his stores and credits the Swoosh with creating the super shoe.
But outside of those areas, it’s been more hit or miss for Nike Running in recent years.
Having enjoyed the Vomero 18 himself, he was curious what his friend would think of it.","Nike chief executive officer Elliott Hill told investors in the company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 conference call last month that the worst is now over.

Net income and sales both declined again in the period, but based on Nike’s “Win Now” actions over the prior 90 days, Hill said: “From here, we expect our business results to improve. It’s time to turn the page.” Investors agreed, with shares closing with a 15 percent increase the following day.

One spot where the numbers are already showing improvement is in running. Nike Running grew by “high single digits” in Q4, and Hill called out the success of the Vomero 18, which has already grown into a $100 million franchise after launching at the end of February.

Three specialty retailers who spoke with Footwear News all agreed: the Nike Running comeback is very much on.

Chris Farley, owner and president of Pacers Running, said Nike is outpacing all of its other vendors, with a 20 percent growth in sales so far in 2025. With five stores in Washington D.C. and Northern Virginia, Pacers has seen the Vomero 18 become its top-seller.

The story is the same for Philadelphia Runner and Heartbreak Hill Running Company, which has locations in Boston, Chicago and Santa Monica, Calif.

“I really liked the [Vomero 17], but we did not sell very many of them,” said Philadelphia Runner co-owner Ross Martinson. “The new Vomeros are the best-selling Nike right away. The problem has been the men’s (sizes), we haven’t been able to get enough of them. But that’s sort of a good problem.”

The Vomero 18 has come in the early days of a streamlined new era for focused on three franchises: Pegasus, Structure and Vomero. In order, the franchises are targeted toward responsive cushioning, supportive cushioning and maximum cushioning.

Each banner gets three different silhouettes, starting with the numbered baseline model and offering upgrades through the Plus and Premium variants. The Pegasus is the only franchise to see all three of its models come to stores already with the Pegasus 41, Pegasus Plus and Pegasus Premium, the latter of which is Nike’s first sneaker to ever feature a curved, full-length Zoom Air unit.

Nike will follow up the Vomero 18, which uses a combination of ReactX and ZoomX foams, on August 7 with the Vomero Plus, which is boosted by a full ZoomX midsole. The Vomero Premium will then come October 2 with Air Zoom units at the forefoot and heel taking the max-cushioned proposition to the highest level.

Heartbreak Hill Running Co. co-founder Dan Fitzgerald, who’s also a Nike Running coach, said the Pegasus franchise has always sold well in his stores and credits the Swoosh with creating the super shoe. But outside of those areas, it’s been more hit or miss for Nike Running in recent years.

Anecdotally, Fitzgerald points to a personal friend who logs 10 miles a day and runs in On. Having enjoyed the Vomero 18 himself, he was curious what his friend would think of it. “He put them on and he said, ‘Yeah it feels pretty good.’ Then I hit up a week later and he said: ‘I’m actually blown away. That’s my favorite shoe.”

With only five of the nine sneakers from the Vomero, Pegasus and Structure lines having launched, it’s still too early to tell what effect the relaunch will have on consumers. At the very least, though, the new dividing lines does it make it easier for retailers to explain to customers.

“Our staff really dictate the experience on the floor,” Farley said. “I think [the shoes’ purposes] are more clear. A simpler approach has been much better, so they’re more comfortable bringing out, talking about features, benefits and all those things where they may not have been as clear in the past.”

The new silos serve to replace the Infinity and Invincible, the purposes of which weren’t quite as clear and were easy to conflate with each other because they have “In” as prefixes.

There is still some concern that the difference, for example, between a base and Plus model may not be quite as recognizable. “The Vomero Plus looks awesome too,” Martinson said. “I’m curious to see how that affects sales of he regular Vomero because it’s kind of a different feel, but they still look fairly similar. So we’ll see how that goes.”

As promising as this year’s returns have been for Nike Running, as well as the positivity of its forecast, it does indeed still have ground to make up in the sport.

For runners who may go out just once or twice a week, as well as walkers and broader fitness enthusiasts, Farley said Nike still isn’t winning that conversation. With those consumers, Brooks, Asics and Hoka still reign.

And because the super shoe race has become so crowded, Martinson believes it will be more important than ever for Nike to win over the more casual runners and offer the best shoes that won’t be used on race days. “[Nike has] dominated super shoes and still leads it, but where they were 90 percent of those sales, maybe they’re going to be 50 to 60 [percent] going forward,” he said. “So it feels like good timing for them. It certainly feels like a turnaround for Nike or a vibe shift.”",https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nike-running-comeback-001.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1,N,,2025-07-14 15:09:23.547151

Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Brian Niccol is doubling down on his push to return staff to the office.

On Monday, CEO Brian Niccol said in a note to staff that its support partners and people managers will be required to come to the office four days a week starting in late September.

Starbucks is also broadening expectations for which workers need to relocate to either of its North American hubs in Seattle and Toronto. Those workers expected to be in-person in either location will have a year to make the move. The company said it will also offer buyouts to employees who don't plan to meet these expectations as part of this broader mandate.

""We are reestablishing our in-office culture because we do our best work when we're together,"" CEO Brian Niccol wrote. ""We share ideas more effectively, creatively solve hard problems, and move much faster. Being in person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.""

In April, the company reported US same-store sales fell for the fifth straight quarter to start 2025, a result Niccol called ""disappointing.""

Starbucks' stock is up just 2% year to date, compared to the S&P 500's nearly 7% gain.

The company is navigating a major brand overhaul amid an environment in which consumer spending has been under pressure. Niccol joined the company last year in a high-profile move from Chipotle, where he had served as CEO since 2018.

Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a recent note to clients that he's eager to hear more about ""updates on timeline and potential costs related to remodels and progress on menu simplification"" in the company's upcoming quarterly report.

The company disclosed in a filing earlier this month that top executives could earn up to $6 million in stock grants if it meets cost-cutting reduction goals.

""We’re driving significant change across the company while staying true to our core values,"" Niccol wrote Monday.

""We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.""

Investment Case: Buy the Resilience, Not the Volatility M&T's Q2 results will likely affirm its ability to navigate a challenging environment through: 1.
In a banking sector buffeted by macro risks, M&T's blend of revenue diversification and operational discipline offers a rare combination of growth and stability.","In an era marked by interest rate uncertainty and sector-wide margin compression, M&T Bank (MTB) has positioned itself as a standout performer through its diversified revenue streams and disciplined management. The upcoming Q2 2025 earnings release on July 16 promises to underscore how the bank's focus on net interest income (NII), fee-based diversification, and cost control could solidify its outperformance amid industry volatility. For investors seeking stability in a choppy banking sector, MTB's metrics and execution may offer a compelling entry point.

Diversified Revenue Streams: NII Growth and Fee Income Momentum

M&T's earnings trajectory hinges on two pillars: its balance sheet management and its non-interest revenue engine. For Q2, sequential NII growth is expected to reach the mid-to-high 3.60% net interest margin (NIM) range, driven by:

- Loan Growth: A modest increase in consumer loans (autos, recreational finance) and commercial & industrial (C&I) lending offsetting declines in commercial real estate (CRE). Full-year loan balances are guided at $135B–$137B, with CRE paydowns now stabilizing.

- Deposit Strength: Strong consumer deposit flows and an extra business day in Q2 are boosting average deposits, which are projected to hit $162B–$164B for 2025. This reduces reliance on costlier wholesale funding and supports margin resilience.

Meanwhile, fee income continues to broaden its reach:

- Trust Services: Q2 trust income is forecast to rise 6.6% year-over-year to $181M, benefiting from wealth management demand.

- Mortgage Banking: Residential subservicing and potential rate-driven origination activity could push mortgage revenue to $127M, up 20% from Q2 2024.

- Diversification: Non-interest income now accounts for 26% of total revenue, with service charges, fund banking, and corporate institutional services all contributing. Full-year fee income is poised to hit the high end of its $2.5B–$2.6B guidance.

Margin Resilience Through Prudent Management

While peers grapple with margin contraction, M&T's strategy to prioritize low-cost deposits and optimize its balance sheet has insulated its NIM. The bank's 65% non-interest-bearing deposit mix and disciplined liability repricing have kept funding costs low, even as CRE loan volumes declined. Management's focus on remixing the loan portfolio—shifting toward higher-yielding C&I and consumer loans—adds further tailwinds.

Importantly, M&T's CET1 ratio is expected to dip to 11% by year-end (from 11.5% in Q1), but this reflects strategic capital allocation: $662M in Q1 share repurchases and a 2.7% Stress Capital Buffer reduction signal confidence in liquidity and risk management. This contrasts with competitors forced to conserve capital amid macroeconomic jitters.

Cost Discipline and Efficiency Gains

Cost management is the third pillar of M&T's resilience. Sequential expense declines in Q2 are projected due to seasonal compensation reductions (e.g., lower stock-based payouts). Full-year non-interest expenses are guided at $5.4B–$5.5B, a 2% year-over-year increase that trails revenue growth. The efficiency ratio is expected to stabilize around 56%, a marked improvement from Q1's elevated 60.5%—a byproduct of one-time items and seasonal spikes.

This discipline contrasts with sector peers, many of whom face rising operational costs from digital transformation investments or compliance headwinds. M&T's focus on simplification and selective tech spending (e.g., enhancing its deposit franchise) avoids overextending its cost base.

Zacks Rank and Dividend Discipline: A Buy Signal?

Despite its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), M&T's stock has outperformed the broader market, rising 27% YTD versus the S&P 500's 10%. The Hold rating reflects near-term sector uncertainty but overlooks MTB's structural strengths.

Investors should note:

- Dividend Track Record: The $1.35 quarterly dividend (yield ~2.7%) has been raised annually for over two decades, signaling capital return discipline.

- Valuation: At current levels, MTB trades at 1.4x tangible book value, a discount to its historical average and to peers like US Bancorp (USB).

Investment Case: Buy the Resilience, Not the Volatility

M&T's Q2 results will likely affirm its ability to navigate a challenging environment through:

1. Margin Stability: NIM expansion in a flattening yield curve environment.

2. Fee Income Diversification: Reducing reliance on rate-sensitive NII.

3. Capital Flexibility: A CET1 ratio that balances growth and safety.

While the Zacks Rank #3 is cautious, it ignores MTB's outperformance and defensive qualities. For investors, the stock's current valuation and dividend make it a compelling buy. Consider accumulating a position ahead of the July 16 earnings release, with a target price of $225–$230 (15x 2025 EPS estimates) and a stop-loss below $200. Historical context supports this strategy: over the past four years, a buy-and-hold approach around MTB's earnings dates achieved a 64.29% win rate in the 3 days following results, though returns moderated to 57.14% over 30 days. The maximum gain reached 1.63%, but periods of negative returns, such as a -0.15% 30-day decline, highlight the need for disciplined risk management.

In a banking sector buffeted by macro risks, M&T's blend of revenue diversification and operational discipline offers a rare combination of growth and stability. The Q2 results could cement its status as a top pick for income-seeking investors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-15 09:03:44.939924

The measures are a win not only for some 20,000 gig workers, but also for rival delivery apps that had complained they were being singled out unfairly under the existing law.
Council officials told Crain’s that the expansion bills were discussed during settlement talks but were not a formal part of the agreement.
The companies also argue that grocery delivery is a necessity for some low-income New Yorkers, not a luxury item like restaurant food.
Advocates for delivery workers support the bills, which they say will benefit a workforce that includes large numbers of African immigrants.","The City Council on Monday is expected to pass two bills that expand New York’s landmark protections for restaurant delivery workers to cover workers who deliver groceries. The measures are a win not only for some 20,000 gig workers, but also for rival delivery apps that had complained they were being singled out unfairly under the existing law.

The two bills build on the 2021 measures that set a minimum wage for delivery drivers — $21.44 as of April, a figure that will rise with inflation — and also guarantee other protections, including access to bathrooms at the businesses they serve. The legislation closes what the website Streetsblog dubbed the “Instacart loophole,” referring to the major grocery-delivery app, which had been exempt from the laws even as they applied to restaurant apps such as DoorDash, Grubhub and UberEats.

Although those app companies opposed the laws when they first applied to them, they supported the new measures as a way to even the playing field. A DoorDash executive told the council in December that “some platforms are at a significant competitive disadvantage compared to their peers, and workers are caught in the middle, left to navigate a regulatory scheme that denies them equal pay for equal work.”

The new minimum-pay expansion “reflects a pragmatic step toward treating all delivery workers consistently, regardless of what they deliver,” said Kassandra Perez-Desir, senior manager of government relations at DoorDash, in a statement on Monday.

Monday’s vote comes a month after the city softened another law that limited the fees that app companies can charge to restaurants. In exchange for that rollback, DoorDash, Grubhub and UberEats agreed to drop two pending lawsuits against the city over the fee cap and the minimum-pay law.

Council officials told Crain’s that the expansion bills were discussed during settlement talks but were not a formal part of the agreement.

Instacart and other grocery apps like Shipt remain opposed to the bills, which they say will increase prices for customers and limit the number of jobs available to gig workers. The companies also argue that grocery delivery is a necessity for some low-income New Yorkers, not a luxury item like restaurant food.

“It’s simply unconscionable that the City Council would pass a bill that would have such devastating consequences for New Yorkers,” said Thomas McNeil, senior manager for government affairs at Instacart, in a statement. “Grocery delivery is a lifeline for thousands of people across the city, especially those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges.”

Mayor Eric Adams has not said whether he will veto the bills, although the council would likely vote to override his rejection. Instacart is widely expected to sue if the measures become law.

Advocates for delivery workers support the bills, which they say will benefit a workforce that includes large numbers of African immigrants.

Brooklyn Councilwoman Sandy Nurse, who sponsored the bill expanding the pay rate, told Crain’s that the complaints of unfairness by the likes of DoorDash and Grubhub were not a significant factor in pushing the bills toward passage.

“Instacart is fighting really hard to stop this legislation, but we did this because any business model that is not able to survive a minimum pay rate is not a successful model,” she said. “We cannot legislate to save individual companies — we have to legislate to protect the workers who are being exploited.”

Regulating delivery apps has been a top priority of city lawmakers since the industry exploded in popularity during the pandemic. The latest legislation also coincides with the apps’ emergence as unexpected political players in the June primary elections: DoorDash spent $1 million to support Andrew Cuomo’s mayoral campaign and spent another $1.2 million on council races, while Uber spent $2.4 million in council contests.",https://s3-prod.crainsnewyork.com/s3fs-public/styles/1200x630/public/main-%20instacart_i.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:31.165644

“[With the Secret Menu] We’re really just working to help put media behind [fans] and get more reach around new ideas.
The only question remaining is, can a secret menu stay cool when it’s available to millions of customers?","Starbucks has been in a bit of a slump, facing stagnant growth as it awaits its new CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround. His strategy? Nicer stores you want to sit in. Protein-loaded coffee. And now . . . turning every day at Starbucks into a viral drop.

The company is launching a “secret menu” in its app today, building off the momentum of its “not-so-secret menu” broadcast channel on Instagram. Secret menus, of course, are irresistible to the fleshy consumer brain. A mystery and treat in one! But in the case of Starbucks, it’s part of a brilliant promotional strategy by its new chief brand officer Tressie Lieberman.

How will Starbucks’s Secret Menu work?

The menu will contain rotating offers for drinks. But instead of being born inside its Seattle headquarters coffee lab, these drinks are created by fans on social media who use Starbucks’s customization options to create particularly alluring beverages.

“That’s what people do today: create their own Starbucks order,” says Lieberman. “And so how do we tap into that?”

Indeed, customization is a big part of Starbucks’s appeal; you can order a drink just as you like it. But its menu has become so sprawling and complicated for baristas to produce that Niccol has actually cut it back by nearly a third to simplify production.

What’s brilliant about the Starbucks Secret Menu—which is launching with a $25,000 prize to stoke interest—is twofold: Instead of creating a TikTok trend, it can simply ride a TikTok trend, since people are already promoting their own custom drinks on the service. But the second component is just as important for a company with tens of thousands of locations worldwide. These glitzy, viral drinks are being made with the ingredients Starbucks already has lying around. In other words, it’s all turnkey. Starbucks doesn’t need to spin up a whole production supply chain to sell the equivalent of a McRib. It can just rearrange its food stuffs to make something novel, a lot like Taco Bell combines its shells and sauces to make something new—but crowdsourced.

This strategy is a far cry from how Starbucks used to look at viral creations: as operational headaches that were at odds with its own business model. Instead, Starbucks can analyze a viral menu item, decide if it needs to be tweaked for scale, and then share it back with its audience in a way that can work.

“Some of the best ideas are coming from customers. Customers decide what’s in; customers decide what’s cool,” says Lieberman. “[With the Secret Menu] We’re really just working to help put media behind [fans] and get more reach around new ideas. It’s a lot about being visible, visible to our audience, and being really strategic about how we approach these different trends as well,” says Lieberman.

She points to a recent viral drink called the Gummy Shark, where TikTokers took the Summer Berry Refresher and added cold foam so it would taste like the popular candy, as a recent proof point of this strategy.

“That’s a gift from our customers,” says Lieberman. “Let’s jump on that. Let’s create content around it and celebrate it, instead of moving away from it.”

In other words, with its new Secret Menu, Starbucks is building a workflow so that they don’t need to come up with their next hit, while ensuring that you can taste the wild thing you’re gawking at online easily. (Its new point-of-sale terminals will even be getting a viral drinks tab so that if you walk into a store without your phone, you can order off this menu as well.)

The only question remaining is, can a secret menu stay cool when it’s available to millions of customers? Anyone who’s ordered a speak-easy-inspired Neapolitan shake or animal style fries from In-N-Out knows . . . the answer is a sad and true, “absolutely yes.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91365360-starbucks-secret-menu.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 14:13:36.773810

Polaris followed the launch with an internal survey, in which 100% of respondents said they wanted to learn more about women’s health.
This is just one of the examples of how the League can organically respond to women’s real-world concerns.
“I will praise the men at Polaris because of the allyship and the support they’re giving us,” Muir said.
Even now, as the League continues to grow, it has created a stronger sense of community among Polaris employees.","Polaris Transportation Group has officially launched the Polaris Women’s League — an initiative borne from the vision of late highway dispatcher Pam Lambe, who dreamed of creating a safe, inclusive space for women at the company.

The idea was first raised several years ago during one of Polaris’ virtual “hot chocolate hours,” informal social gatherings the company hosted to support employee morale during remote work. This is according to Laura Muir, Polaris’ chief human resources officer, who told trucknews.com that during one such gathering, Lambe suggested having women-only meetings to talk openly about topics like health, home life, and mental wellness.

“She said, ‘How great would it be to have just the women, where we could talk about health and just generally, have a free space to speak?'” Muir said. “She passed some time ago last year, and I wanted to launch this in her memory. She would be so happy.”

Launched on International Women’s Day this March, the League’s inaugural event — a tea party held both in-person and virtually — drew unexpectedly high turnout and overwhelming enthusiasm, she adds. Polaris followed the launch with an internal survey, in which 100% of respondents said they wanted to learn more about women’s health.

Since then, the League has evolved into a dynamic, employee-led initiative offering quarterly formal events and a range of ongoing activities that have branched out since. These include a book club, movie club, a walking group that meets weekly — and sometimes daily — during warmer months. Muir says there was even a discussion about general auto mechanics, sparked after someone asked how to check tire pressure and change a tire.

The conversation came up casually during one tea party, after Muir mentioned she had low air in her tires. Several women said they didn’t know how to check or refill them. That led to plans for Polaris’ driver manager to attend an upcoming session to give a hands-on demonstration of basic auto maintenance.

This is just one of the examples of how the League can organically respond to women’s real-world concerns.

“It’s just really brought us all together,” Muir said. “I’m seeing departments such as our dispatch department, our HR department, you know, we’re all working alongside with people we wouldn’t regularly work with, or chat with. So it’s really nice.”

Topics that have resonated the most with attendees include menopause, mental wellness, work-life balance and navigating family life. Women in the group have swapped meal prep tips, discussed parenting, and shared wellness resources, including information from Polaris’ community partners and benefits providers.

Polaris is also partnering with its benefits broker to host educational sessions on menopause in the workplace this fall.

Enabling the league with company-wide allyship

Muir emphasized that the League’s success wouldn’t be possible without company-wide support — including from male colleagues and leadership. Managers across departments have encouraged participation, and men at the company have even stepped in to cover duties so women can attend.

“I will praise the men at Polaris because of the allyship and the support they’re giving us,” Muir said. “It really does tighten the family of Polaris.”

As Polaris welcomes new hires, Muir hopes the League will serve as a lasting reminder of Lambe’s legacy and a model for fostering genuine connection and support at work.

“Polaris isn’t just the employees…In Pam’s case, her sister was an extension of her. Our whole families become part of this,” she said recalling the times of Lambe’s illness, adding that Muir and the team stayed in close contact with her sister. Even now, as the League continues to grow, it has created a stronger sense of community among Polaris employees. Women are more involved in each other’s lives — checking in when someone is sick, supporting and celebrating each other, Muir said.",https://www.trucknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Polaris_WomensLeague-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:50.997693

Q2 Earnings Whispers for Elevance

Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the company this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. That is not the case here.

ELV has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

What’s Shaping Elevance’s Q2 Results?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for product revenues indicates 11.1% growth from the year-ago period’s $5.5 billion. The consensus estimate for premiums indicates an 11.9% increase from the year-ago period. These are likely to have aided revenues in the second quarter.

The consensus mark for Commercial Individual membership implies 5.9% growth from a year ago, while our model estimate indicates a 5.6% increase. However, the consensus estimate for Commercial Fee-based memberships indicates a 0.1% year-over-year decline.

Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Carelon brand’s operating income for the second quarter indicates a 14.1% year-over-year increase. Growth in CarelonRx is primarily expected to have aided the brand. The results are likely to have been supported by the recent buyouts in home health and pharmacy services.

However, its expenses are likely to have remained elevated in the quarter due to substantial investments in digital capabilities and platforms. High benefit expenses, cost of products sold and interest expenses are likely to have affected profit margins, making earnings beat uncertain. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the benefit expense ratio is pegged at 88.4, higher than the year-ago level of 86.3. We expect total expenses to jump nearly 11% year over year in the second quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Health Benefits segment’s operating income for the second quarter indicates a 12.4% year-over-year decrease. Also, declining memberships in Medicaid are likely to have kept second-quarter premium growth in check.

Stocks That Warrant a Look

While an earnings beat looks uncertain for Elevance, here are some companies from the broader Medical space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:

Boston Scientific Corporation BSX has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

CVS Health Corporation CVS has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank of 2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVS Health’s bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $1.47. CVS Health’s earnings beat estimates in each of the past four quarters, with an average surprise of 18.1%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Summit Therapeutics’ bottom line for the to-be-reported quarter has witnessed one upward estimate revision in the past 60 days with no opposite movement. Summit Therapeutics’ earnings beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, met once and missed on the other occasion, with an average surprise of 3.1%.

Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson is facing legal action in the UK over claims that its talcum powder products contained asbestos and caused cancer in thousands of people.

Law firm KP Law says more than 100,000 people could have developed cancer, including ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, fallopian tube and peritoneal cancer after regularly using the company’s talc products.

“They knew it was dangerous”: Lawyers say company failed to warn public

As early as the 1970s, it is claimed that Johnson & Johnson knew that asbestos contamination in its talc-based products posed a serious cancer risk – but continued selling them in the UK until 2023 without consumer warnings. In 2023, Johnson & Johnson switched to a corn starch-based product despite making this change in the US in 2020.

“This once-trusted corporation knew for decades that asbestos in its talc products was dangerous,” said Tom Longstaff, partner at KP Law and the barrister leading the UK case.

“They did nothing to notify consumers, who are now paying the highest price imaginable for the sake of corporate greed.”

We’ve teamed up with KP Law to raise awareness of this claim. Have you been affected? Read more or start your claim with KP Law now.

Thousands of potential claimants step forward

KP Law is currently representing over 4,000 people who have joined the group action against Johnson & Johnson. The firm has issued a letter before action and is now preparing to file its claim against Johnson & Johnson.

Talcum powder linked to cancer by global health authorities

In July 2024, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified talc as “probably carcinogenic” to humans, including in relation to ovarian cancer.

Who may be affected by asbestos in talcum powder?

People who used talcum powder regularly for five or more years, starting 10 or more years before a cancer diagnosis, may be eligible to join the claim.

This includes people diagnosed with:

Ovarian cancer

Fallopian tube cancer

Primary peritoneal cancer

Mesothelioma (including in men)

“There are thousands of women in the UK with ovarian or related cancers who could be eligible to make a claim against Johnson & Johnson,” said Longstaff.

“Some men also qualify in relation to peritoneal cancer and mesothelioma.”

Claimants speak out: “We all used talc”

Linda Jones, 66, from North Devon, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2023. She used Johnson & Johnson talc from birth until her 20s.

“We all used talc, without exception,” she said. “If there was any suggestion that it could cause harm to babies or women, it should have been taken off the market decades ago.”

Cassandra Wardle, 44, from Derbyshire, was diagnosed in 2022 and shared a similar experience:

“Johnson & Johnson talcum powder was in every home and a trusted brand,” she said. “I want to know why they didn’t change the ingredients when they knew it was dangerous.”

Substantial compensation claims expected

KP Law says potential damages would reach six figures per claimant, especially for those who have experienced major health consequences or loss of life.

In the US, Johnson & Johnson has set aside more than $13 billion (£9.6 billion) to settle similar claims.

Johnson & Johnson denies claims, maintains product safety

In response, a Johnson & Johnson spokesperson said the company has always followed advanced testing protocols and worked transparently with regulators.

“Our findings show no asbestos contamination in Johnson’s Baby Powder or in the talc we used,” the company said.

“We’ve won the majority of US trials either initially or on appeal.”

With import tariffs on the horizon, shipments to the U.S. surged, inventory filled up, and the market posted strong early signs of growth. But that head start came with a catch: now, in the second quarter, U.S. PC sales have flattened slightly, dampening the global momentum.

However, despite the flatlining in the US, the global performance remains positive. PC shipments rose 6.5% year-over-year in Q2 2025, reaching 68.4 million units according to data from IDC. Demand across Europe, Asia, and other key regions continues to see traction. This was driven by an ageing installed base, combined with the continued rollout of Windows 11.

This international appetite for PCs is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Without it, global numbers would look very different. The U.S. current stagnation is being felt across supply chains and in vendor strategies. After a spike in Q1 shipments, timed to beat potential tariffs, sales in the U.S. have slowed significantly. Not a collapse, but a pause that adds friction to the broader recovery.

Still, the global market is holding firm. Lenovo grew shipments by more than 15% and maintained its position at the top of the market. Apple saw the biggest jump, up over 21% year-over-year, thanks in part to strong MacBook demand. HP posted modest gains, while Dell slipped into negative territory, down 3%. Overall, the performance was respectable, but it’s uneven.

As the second half of the year approaches, the challenge will be sustaining that momentum. The global market is proving it can grow even with headwinds, but the situation in the U.S.—great in Q1, flat in Q2—remains the wild card. If demand there continues to slow or tariffs shift pricing strategies too sharply, it could begin to drag on the broader performance.

That uncertainty is keeping the entire industry on edge. Ryan Reith, IDC’s group vice president for Worldwide Device Trackers, says the current growth feels counterintuitive, but not without explanation. Supply chain players, still cautious from past shocks, are moving to capture demand while they can, but walking a tightrope. Overextending means running the risk of bloated inventories. Holding back could mean missing the moment. If tariffs go into effect as expected, prices are likely to rise, but not uniformly.

For now, global sales are carrying the industry forward. But navigating the next few quarters will require adaptability and a close watch on the market that still sets the pace for much of the world.",https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1652430871152-0b95b204f8e5?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3wxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDM5fHxwY3xlbnwwfHx8fDE3NTI1MDIxNDd8MA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=2000,N,,2025-07-14 13:33:44.276599

(TRUE:CSE; TREIF:OTCMKTS; 939:FRA), through its subsidiary Rocket Doctor Inc., has launched a new virtual health screening initiative for adults over the age of 60 in collaboration with EngageWell IPA. The program, known as the Healthy Aging Program, is backed by a five-year US$1 million grant from the CVS Health Foundation and aims to improve healthcare access for older adults in New York City.

The program provides no-cost virtual screenings for heart health, cognitive and memory function, and mental health. Board-certified physicians conduct consultations via phone or video and offer follow-up care plans tailored to each patient. Community Health Workers assist with navigation and help participants access necessary local services. Patients on Medicaid can access the service at no cost, while Medicare patients are covered through insurance.

Dr. William Cherniak, Founder and CEO of Rocket Doctor, stated in the press release, ""We're proud to again partner with EngageWell to bring high-quality, proactive care directly into the homes of older adults across New York City."" The pilot aims to reduce barriers related to language, digital literacy, and mobility, and to address healthcare access issues in underserved communities.

The launch follows Treatment.com AI's recent acquisition of Rocket Doctor, finalized earlier this year. Since then, Rocket Doctor has reported significant growth across its operations. In Alberta, Canada, patient volume increased by 112% year-over-year, with 36,779 patients served in the past 12 months. Physician participation also grew from 22 to 70 over the same period, a 218% rise.

Rocket Doctor has also entered into new partnerships, including a virtual care program with Central California Alliance for Health, which serves approximately 450,000 Medi-Cal members, and an initiative with Melanoma Canada to improve follow-up care for high-risk skin cancer patients. In recognition of its clinical innovation, Rocket Doctor was named a Top Clinical Innovator by the American Telemedicine Association and was featured at events hosted by Harvard Medical School and the AARP AgeTech Accelerator.

The parent company, Treatment.com AI, continues to evolve and integrate its AI-powered diagnostic engine, the Global Library of Medicine (GLM), across medical education, telehealth, and provider platforms. According to the company's July 2025 investor presentation, the GLM currently includes over 10,000 expert medical reviews and is designed to assist with diagnosing more than 1,000 diseases in real time.

Telehealth Sector Faces New Standards and Growing Regulatory Demands

The virtual care and telehealth sector remained in a period of transition during mid-2025, as stakeholders navigated growing regulatory pressures, operational scrutiny, and efforts to redefine ethical practices across the industry.

On April 3, Fierce Healthcare published a retrospective analysis examining how the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped healthcare delivery in the United States. Jesse Ehrenfeld, M.D., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, emphasized that ""you can't have a conversation about the last five years and not talk about telehealth."" He noted a dramatic rise in adoption, with three-quarters of physicians offering telehealth by late 2023, compared to only one-quarter before the pandemic. Fierce Healthcare reported that this expansion improved access to care, especially for mental health services and patients in remote areas, and encouraged broader use of patient portals. However, experts like Patricia McGaffigan of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement advised that adoption must remain measured, stating, ""it's important for us to proceed with a reasonable level of enthusiasm, but also a clear degree of caution.""

The introduction of artificial intelligence tools into telehealth also drew attention. According to Ehrenfeld, ""AI is coming into practice in a way that is really exciting,"" citing a 78% increase in physician usage of health-related AI tools from 2023 to 2024. Yet, regulatory gaps and concerns around responsible implementation continued. Fierce Healthcare noted that general-purpose AI models were sometimes used for clinical decisions, raising questions about patient safety and oversight.

According to a June 12 report from Future Market Insights, the global wireless healthcare asset management market was projected to increase from US$52.06 billion in 2025 to US$155.40 billion by 2035. The report attributed this growth to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and real-time tracking tools within hospitals. These technologies were used to monitor high-value equipment such as infusion pumps and surgical instruments, improve maintenance scheduling, and enhance patient safety through predictive analytics.

The report also noted that cloud-based platforms enabled real-time equipment monitoring, predictive maintenance, and compliance tracking. It identified a trend toward integrating AI systems with electronic health records (EHRs) and hospital information systems (HIS) to support resource optimization and more informed clinical decisions.

Strategic Positioning in Virtual Care and AI Health Tools

The collaboration with EngageWell and the CVS Health Foundation aligns with Treatment.com AI's broader strategy to merge artificial intelligence with physician-led care models. The company's AI platform has been implemented in university clinical training programs, including the University of Minnesota Medical School, where it enabled OSCE testing of 240 students using AI-simulated patients. The institution estimates that the AI-driven platform could reduce exam costs by approximately 40%.

Rocket Doctor's model combines telehealth infrastructure with physician autonomy, allowing doctors to independently manage virtual clinics. As of July 2025, Rocket Doctor has facilitated care for over 600,000 patients across four Canadian provinces and three U.S. states, supported by a physician network of over 300 professionals.

Revenue generation is driven by a mix of per-appointment fees in the U.S. and Canada, monthly platform fees from physicians, and direct-to-consumer partnerships. According to Treatment's July 2025 presentation, these include pharmacy kiosks and device-enabled care stations used by independent provider associations.

The company has also attracted national attention through accelerator programs at institutions such as UC Berkeley and public recognition through speaking engagements and awards. These developments reinforce Treatment.com AI's role as a key player in expanding access to virtual care for aging and underserved populations through scalable, physician-led, AI-enhanced platforms.

Analyst Identifies Technical Rebound and Operational Strength at AI Healthtech Company

*On May 21, Technical Analyst Clive Maund published an assessment of Treatment.com AI Inc., highlighting what he described as the company's strategic positioning within the evolving artificial intelligence (AI) healthcare landscape.

Maund noted that Treatment.com AI had developed a physician-designed platform intended to address inefficiencies in healthcare by combining clinical intelligence, virtual care capabilities, and voice assistant technology into a unified system. He referred to the company's diagnostic tools — powered by the proprietary Global Library of Medicine (GLM) — as offering continuous availability and AI-driven voice interactivity intended to support clinical workflows.

He also referenced the company's Rocket Doctor subsidiary, describing it as a ""Shopify for physicians"" that allowed practitioners to launch remote clinics and expand access to virtual care. Maund cited the model's scalability as a factor in its relevance to the broader telehealth market.

From a technical standpoint, Maund observed that the company's stock had recently completed what he interpreted as a three-wave A-B-C correction pattern and was rising from a long-term base established over a 30-month period. He identified technical support levels that, in his view, marked a potential inflection point for the stock's movement.

In his analysis, Maund stated that recent volume patterns signaled growing investor interest, describing the accumulation since early 2024 as ""supportive of a significant new uptrend."" He outlined an initial target range of CA$1.08 to CA$1.12, with a secondary target of CA$4.00. Maund concluded that the combination of market positioning and technical indicators suggested, in his opinion, that it was ""an excellent time to buy or add to positions in Treatment.com AI.""

The store is located at 6939 Coal Creek Parkway S.E. in Newcastle.

In May, it was announced that CVS would take over many of the Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs locations that were closing in Washington, according to regulatory filings. The Newcastle location is one of 64 stores CVS is converting across Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, according to The Puget Sound Business Journal.

That includes 20 Bartell Drugs locations, marking the end of an era for the local brand.

Rite Aid, which filed for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years, agreed to sell more than 1,000 of its stores to a group of competitors. That group includes Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger, Giant Eagle, and, for the Pacific Northwest, CVS Pharmacy. The Pennsylvania-based pharmacy chain entered bankruptcy with more than $2 billion in debt.

CVS wants to make the switch smooth for customers, as prescription files have already been transferred and loyalty programs are in place. Some former Bartell employees were kept on through the conversion.

All stores plan to be open by Oct. 1.

Which Rite Aid stores in WA are closing?

Eight Rite Aid stores are closing in Washington across eight different cities.

Anacortes is losing its location at 1517 Commercial Avenue, while Ephrata is losing its store at 250 Basin Street. The other Rite Aid stores affected are in Granite Falls (608 W. Stanley Street), Kingston (27000 Miller Bay Road N.E.), North Bend (248 Bendigo Boulevard), Omak (609 Omache Drive), Snoqualmie (35013 Snoqualmie Parkway), and Yelm (909 E. Yelm Avenue).

The Ephrata and North Bend locations are Bartell’s pharmacy stores.

Bartell, founded in 1890 in Seattle, was believed to be the nation’s oldest existing family-owned drugstore chain until it was sold to Rite Aid in 2020 for $95 million.

Related: Private investors pumping billions into primary care

Loren Adler, a Brookings Institution researcher, led the team that wrote the article.

The team came up with the figures by analyzing Medicare program data. The authors did not look at figures for physicians who bill commercial health plans, but they likely reflect most primary care physicians in the United States, because Medicare program managers have estimated that 98% of U.S. physicians take Medicare.

The backdrop: A ""vertical integration"" deal involves efforts by one or more vendors to combine with one or more of their suppliers.

Defenders of vertical integration involving health insurers and health care providers have argued that at least some of the deals may improve the cost and quality of care in at least some markets. In 2018, for example, Ken Pokalsky, a vice president with the Business Council of New York State, wrote to the U.S. Justice Department Antitrust Division to support the CVS acquisition of Aetna. Pokalsky predicted that the deal would help CVS and Aetna hold down premiums, improve preventive care and improve primary care.

But Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, suggested in January in a public letter to Elon Musk, who then was overseeing efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to streamline the federal government, that the government should consider breaking up UnitedHealth because of its dominant size and breadth.

The researchers' views: The Adler team did not look in the new paper at the impact of vertical integration on the cost, availability or quality of primary care.

In May 2023, Adler told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee that vertical integration in health care could have both positive and negative effects.

Adler and his colleagues do recommend in the new paper that policymakers and other researchers look into the impact of vertical integration on the primary care market.

Vertical integration could ""give insurers an advantage over competing health plans by steering patients toward their own services or making it harder for other insurers to contract with their physician groups,"" the authors wrote. ""Additionally, payer acquisitions can directly reduce competition in local physician markets, potentially leading to higher prices or less choice for patients.""

Robert Moskow, an analyst with TD Cowen, wrote at the time the announcement meant some businesses would be divested, adding, “We, too, believe KHC should slim down its portfolio.”

In November 2021, the company sold portions of its cheese business to the Lactalis Group and Emmi Roth USA Inc.

The July 2015 merger of Heinz and Kraft was accompanied by considerable investor enthusiasm. Heinz had been acquired two years earlier by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway in a $28 billion deal, a transaction that appeared highly successful before the Kraft merger. Meanwhile, the Kraft grocery business had been separated in 2012 from its snack foods brands (mostly Nabisco), a business that was renamed Mondelez International.

While the Kraft Heinz combination appeared to go well briefly, sales and profits began flagging within a couple of years. Numerous efforts since then have failed to reignite growth. The company’s share price (adjusted for subsequent dividends) recorded its highest monthly close in May 2017 at $63.44 and has not returned to that level since. On July 10, a day before the Journal’s article, Kraft Heinz shares closed at $26.47, down 58% from the May 2017 adjusted close. Shares closed July 11 at $27.14, up 67¢, or 2.5%, for the day.",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2025/05/21/kraft-heiz-lead----MOJAHID-MOTTAKIN.jpg?height=635&t=1747842154&width=1200,N,,2025-07-14 13:34:17.376114

“That’s why Michelin is proud to introduce the Michelin X Line Grip D tire.
This tire has the potential to redefine the drive tire standard in fleets for years to come.
The X Line Grip D tire will be available in sizes 295/75R22.5 and 11R22.5.
“This fantastic leap in drive tire technology brings new levels of performance to the road and new levels of savings for our customers.”","Michelin recently introduced the X Line Grip D tire, which provides exceptional mileage, lasting traction, and features a durable casing designed to reach up to 1 million miles with up to four retreads—all of which assists fleets that are moving goods to consumers across North America.

Recently, Michelin partnered with television host and MythBusters legend Adam Savage and his team, providing an opportunity to witness testing demonstrations on the new X Line Grip D tire and learn about this revolutionary tire on his show Tested.

“We at Michelin are dedicated to evolving tire performance through relentless innovation and ongoing technological advancements,” Pierluigi Cumo, Michelin North America VP of B2B marketing, said in a news release. “That’s why Michelin is proud to introduce the Michelin X Line Grip D tire. This tire has the potential to redefine the drive tire standard in fleets for years to come.

“It is not an evolution to existing products, but something entirely different the fleet world has not seen before.”

The X Line Grip D tire is an example of benefit-focused innovation, and Michelin tire designers characterize this new product as a “once-in-a-lifetime” leap in tire technology for fleets, the company reported. This new SmartWay-verified drive tire helps fleets control their operational costs, providing 20% more mileage and 20% reduction in rolling resistance than the XDN2 tire. Drivers can also remain confident in this 3PMSF-rated drive tire’s excellent traction performance in wet and snowy conditions thanks to the unique chevron tread design. Based on testing of worn tires, the X Line Grip D tire provides more than 90% better snow-starting traction and more than 25% better wet-starting traction than the XDN2 tire. Additionally, fleets can get more out of their assets as the X Line Grip D tire is built on Michelin’s Duracore casing, featuring Infinicoil and Powercoil technologies.

The X Line Grip D tire will be available in sizes 295/75R22.5 and 11R22.5.

According to HP research, workers who feel confident using AI tools are significantly more likely to report high-quality connections with their colleagues.","In the workplace, as in life, humans crave connection. But how we connect is evolving. Today’s impromptu hallway conversation has been supplanted by video calls, chat threads, shared whiteboards, and AI-enabled platforms that aim to replicate—and even enhance—that sense of spontaneous collaboration.

But when these tools are fragmented or poorly designed, they can do more harm than good. That’s why business leaders must be intentional about how technology bridges physical distances and fosters connection, trust, and creativity.

Recently, a panel of experts discussed how to reimagine workspaces while at Fast Company’s New World of Work Summit, held in partnership with HP. Here are three takeaways from their conversation. (Some comments have been edited for length and clarity; scroll to the bottom to watch the entire panel discussion.)

1. Let people focus on the work, not the tech.

In the future of work, the workplace is no longer a fixed location—it is wherever the work is happening. “The focus will shift from the place where I do my work to the work I am doing and the people I’m collaborating with,” said Helen Sheirbon, svp and chief operating officer, Global HP Solutions.

That collaboration is increasingly virtual. To keep it fluid, technology needs to fade into the background—not get in the way. Sheirbon pointed out that video conferencing tools should work intuitively using AI to handle things like auto-framing the speaker, filtering out background noise, or adjusting lighting so people’s nuanced expressions and gestures can be clearly seen and heard.

“People need to be able to focus on what they’re talking about, not wondering if they look right on camera, or whether their colleague can hear the lawnmower,” Sheirbon said.

2. Design for inclusion—so everyone is seen and heard.

Historically, workplaces have been designed to maximize productivity. But comfort, belonging, and accessibility? Not always considered. That’s changing.

Rani Johnson, chief information officer at Workday, shared how poor lighting during a customer video call left her feeling like just a “set of teeth” on screen. “If I think about my IT team, 52% of whom are in India and many of whom share my complexion—if they’re not feeling seen, that’s a problem,” she said.

Her team took action—experimenting with lighting, conferencing tools, adjusting camera placement, and training employees on how to create a video-friendly space. In some rooms, cameras were positioned too low, creating awkward angles—especially for those wearing dresses or skirts.

They also layered in AI tools to improve accessibility, like real-time transcripts in Zoom for hearing-impaired team members. But tech is just part of the equation. Creating space for every voice to be heard—especially quieter or more introverted team members—requires cultural shifts too.

“I often use this analogy of double Dutch: I’m in a meeting and I’m trying to say something, but I don’t know when to jump in,” Johnson said. “We need to make sure we’re creating environments where everyone feels comfortable to offer their opinions.

“Some of it is tech, but a lot of it is how to facilitate the best environment to get the most out of the creativity that can’t be replaced by AI,” she added. “That’s just innately human.”

3. Demystify AI to unlock its potential.

According to HP research, workers who feel confident using AI tools are significantly more likely to report high-quality connections with their colleagues. But building that proficiency and trust takes more than tools. It takes leadership.

At Workday, Johnson launched a company-wide “Everyday AI” initiative to help employees explore AI through practical training and grassroots support. The company created a network of “AI champions” within departments to model use cases, share results, and answer questions—in some cases leading to three times more adoption of AI in those groups.

“It wasn’t the IT team or the leader coming down and saying, ‘You will do this,’ ” Johnson said. “It’s your teammate showing how it can be used and how to get to true ROI.”

Unlocking the potential of AI needs to happen at the functional level, the panelists agreed. When leaders publicly embrace opportunities to model its use, they create space for others to do so.

“People say all the time, ‘I asked ChatGPT to do this.’ Well, you can also say in a meeting, ‘Shall we get a transcript going?’ or, ‘Sorry I was late, but I’m all caught up because I checked out the AI meeting summary,’ ” Sheirbon said.

This modeling behavior is critical for building trust and normalizing AI adoption, she added. It sends a signal not just of endorsement but of accessibility. “Exploration is part of the process,” she said. “We don’t just want people to adopt AI, we want them to experiment, share, and grow more confident with it.”

Sheirbon added that small, visible actions like sharing how a tool saved time or improved a meeting can trigger curiosity and accelerate learning across teams. “Create that space where it may seem like play, but it’s not—it’s an exploration of what is possible.”

That was the focus of Fast Company’s recent New World of Work Summit in partnership with HP, which included a panel discussion on how to lead in this new era, featuring experts from different fields.
Two factors are shaping this new world: hybrid work and AI.
Hybrid work is here to stay, despite return-to-office mandates over the past few years, said Dave Shull, president, HP Solutions.
“IT working hand-in-hand with HR will allow companies to work through AI and hybrid in a very different way,” he said.","We’re in an era of hyperinnovation, full of rapid technological advancements in artificial intelligence and beyond. This environment is creating a new world of work, one that offers both opportunities and challenges. What are business leaders to do in such exciting, volatile times? That was the focus of Fast Company’s recent New World of Work Summit in partnership with HP, which included a panel discussion on how to lead in this new era, featuring experts from different fields. Here are three takeaways from their conversation. (Some comments have been edited for length and clarity; scroll to the bottom to watch the entire panel discussion.)

1. Two factors are shaping this new world: hybrid work and AI.

Hybrid work is here to stay, despite return-to-office mandates over the past few years, said Dave Shull, president, HP Solutions. He cited research from digital collaboration firm Vyopta showing that the number of virtual meetings has not declined, even as in-person meetings more than doubled as people returned to the office. “We thought hybrid was going to go away, and it hasn’t,” Shull said. “That’s a reality and a real challenge that I think we as companies need to address.”

Meanwhile, AI is also changing the face of work in multiple ways. For one, it can help people work cross-functionally and better understand other roles within the business, said Tobias Chen, CEO of Volumetric Camera Systems, which creates immersive video content for film, TV, and other media. He provided an example from the visual effects industry, in which technical backend workers historically had very separate tasks from artists—yet both sides are needed to make projects come to life.

“Now with AI tools, if you’re in a technical role, you can use AI to pre-visualize what those creative graphics could look like,” Chen said. “And those in a creative role can use AI to do those technical steps for you. That cross-pollination helps the whole organization better understand what everyone’s doing.”

AI also enables team members to experiment and iterate with concepts before deciding on the best solution. This iterative process allowed Volumetrics to create a project for The Sphere, an immersive entertainment arena in Las Vegas, in just one month—a deadline that, Chen said, would have been “impossible” otherwise. “Through AI, we’re able to create a lot of concepts and different ideas, then test them out really quickly and iteratively before locking in something and going through the final process.”

“It’s the intersection of those two points—hybrid work and AI—that defines the new world of work,” Shull added. “And the challenge for all of us is to figure out how to solve for our employees.”

2. Tools must foster connection to fuel productivity.

The panelists discussed the tension between engagement and productivity, with some noting that too many tools with too little guidance can undercut the employee experience. If employees do not feel engaged, their productivity will plummet.

Shull noted that technology is now so baked into the employee experience, that the IT function is as critical as the HR function. “IT working hand-in-hand with HR will allow companies to work through AI and hybrid in a very different way,” he said. “IT is key to the employee experience: Are we taking care of that employee experience as the primary metric? And how are we making sure our employees are as impactful as possible, whether they’re at home or in the office?”

As a result, the chief information officer and chief people officer roles are converging, Shull said. He recommended close collaboration between these two leaders and functions, including joint projects like an “early warning system” that flags the beginnings of waning employee engagement.

“There’s going to have to be a reinvention of IT,” Shull said. “It’s being charged in a strategic way like never before: ‘Take AI and transform the company.’ It is now a driving force for growth.”

3. Leaders must trust team members to choose the best way to execute their tasks.

Brian Elliott, the CEO at Work Forward, an advisory group dedicated to helping leaders build better ways of working through data, said the rapid pace of change and emergence of new tools is causing many executives to fall back on “command and control.” Rather than putting more policies in place in order to figure things out, he said they should be asking, “How do I align people around purpose, because that’s what’s going to [engage] them.”

Elliott’s advice is twofold. First, leaders must get their own hands on AI and other new tools if they expect their team members to adopt them. Too often, he pointed out, this isn’t the case. When employees see that their leaders are learning and adapting alongside the rest of the team, it inherently builds trust.

Second, Elliott recommends that leaders ensure they remain focused on business outcomes. Rather than dictate use of a certain tool or process, present it as one tool of an entire arsenal that team members can use to achieve that outcome. Trusting them to execute will engender trust in you as a leader.

“Give them a little bit of latitude instead of command and control,” he said. “Say, ‘Look, these are the big audacious goals we’ve got, but I want you to figure out how we’re going to get there. That’s why I’ve hired you.’ ”

Analysts estimate adjusted earnings of $9.197 per share on sales of $48.24 billion, as per data from Benzinga Pro.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) has been the first major health insurer to report quarterly earnings for several quarters. However, this quarter, the insurance giant will release its second quarter 2025 financial results on July 29.

As it's the biggest player in the industry, Forbes writes that analysts and investors often use its results to gauge the sector's overall health.

All eyes will be on the sector after Centene Corp's (NYSE:CNC) withdrawal of its 2025 GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS guidance, which stems from its initial review of 2025 industry data from Wakely, an independent actuarial firm.

While withdrawing its comprehensive EPS guidance, Centene has reaffirmed its fiscal year 2025 adjusted EPS to be greater than $7.25, aligning with the consensus of $7.23.

UnitedHealth suspended its 2025 outlook in May, citing that care activity continued to accelerate.

Earlier in July, managed healthcare service provider under the Medicaid and Medicare programs, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), issued preliminary second-quarter results and lowered its full-year 2025 earnings outlook, citing rising medical costs across its Medicaid, Medicare, and state marketplace businesses.

The company expects Q2 adjusted earnings of approximately $5.50 per share—slightly below earlier forecasts—due to expected cost pressures that will persist into the second half of the year.

As a result, Molina cut its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to $21.50 -$22.50, down from at least $24.50 previously. The new forecast reflects a consolidated pre-tax margin just under 4%, at the low end of the company's long-term target.

Forbes adds Centene's announcement is just the latest in a series of updates from health insurers who, over the past two years, have had a hard time managing the costs of people enrolled in government-subsidized health plans.

Price Action: UNH stock is down 1.29% at $300.19 at the last check on Monday.

The CEO and Executive leadership team are essential to executing the company's vision and strategic plan.
How can a board of directors be a table of leaders that set about transformational business change at a business?","Being on a board of directors is more than just a fancy title and compensation package. For many, the opportunity to serve on a board of directors allows them to assist in moving a company into the future, enabling the long-term strategic thought that is needed for guiding high-level executives to perform at their peak capabilities.

Bridget Ryan Berman serves on three boards: Newell Brands, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers and Asbury Automotive Group. She has extensive executive experience at brands that are household names including Ralph Lauren, Apple (Chief Operating Officer for Retail), Giorgio Armani and Victoria's Secret Direct (Chief Executive Officer).

All that experience has put Berman in the position of offering advice to those who aspire to be in her position one day. She told Newsweek how she got to where she is today and offered advice for those looking to reach new heights in their career.

Newsweek: How did you get into the role of serving on a board?

Berman: ""I appreciate the value of strong working relationships. Most of my board roles have come by way of recommendations from people who I previously worked with, or who served with me as a director on other boards. Personal references can be extremely powerful, particularly when someone has direct knowledge of your skills and understands the advantages you bring to the boardroom.""

What successes drove you to serving on boards? What are your areas of expertise?

""I was fortunate to have held various executive leadership roles in world-class brands and companies during high-growth periods. My experience has been in consumer and retail businesses where the breadth of responsibility is vast, and the ability to have a meaningful impact is significant. Retail is a dynamic industry with constant change and evolution. I felt prepared having led companies and organizations through large scale transformative growth and understood how to work constructively with CEOs and peer directors.""

Why is the leadership of a board of directors important to a company in ways that can complement a traditional corporate leadership hierarchy?

""I believe in strong partnerships between the board and management, and that theirs is a healthy and productive balance of responsibilities. A board is vital to a company's success. Their role is to set the strategic direction, provide oversight and accountability, and ensure that the company manages both its operations and potential risks effectively, while protecting shareholder interests. The CEO and Executive leadership team are essential to executing the company's vision and strategic plan. They oversee the company's goals, and provide the organizational talent, structure, and resources to deliver expected results. Given the speed by which business is changing and industries are evolving, boards are increasingly interested in understanding how technology and innovation can drive growth, enhance efficiency, and influence future strategies.""

How can a board of directors be a table of leaders that set about transformational business change at a business?

""It starts with building consensus amongst the directors about the future of the company. Boards should dedicate the right amount of time in every meeting to talk about strategy and growth. Though it is not the board's role to direct change in the business, they can be highly influential and encourage management to realize the need or potential. Where I have seen it work best is when there is ongoing honest conversation between management and the board about the future vision. The board should be a helpful resource, particularly when individual directors have had experience in large scale transformation and understand the dynamics and the risks. It requires patience and a nuanced style of management from both sides.""

What have you learned during your time on various boards that you implement as a strategy on others?

""Board governance and effectiveness comes to mind. We are dealing with a broadening range of complex issues, and having the right mix of diverse skills and experience on the board is important. I have focused on improving board performance, spending time on the most critical matters, and ensuring there is organizational succession and readiness to address significant issues and opportunities.""

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace.
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.
Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include the number of Virginia enrollees covered by the Aetna health insurance plans leaving the ACA marketplace.","Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services and the soon-to-be extinguished plans cover nearly 5,000 enrollees, as of January of this year.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

This figure marks a 57% increase from the estimated £5.6bn underpayment recorded the year before.

US corporations represent the largest share of tax underpayment among foreign entities, contributing to 46% of the total £19bn in tax underpaid by all international companies operating in the UK.

In light of these findings, HMRC has intensified its scrutiny of major US firms, particularly those in the technology sector.

Some analysts have suggested that these companies are minimising their tax obligations in the UK by reallocating profits to jurisdictions with lower tax rates, such as Dublin.

UHY Hacker Young pointed out that a prevalent strategy used by these firms is known as ‘transfer pricing’.

This involves transactions between subsidiaries, where one entity compensates another for goods and services, including intellectual property rights, potentially leading to reduced taxable income in the UK.

The US government has expressed concerns regarding what it perceives as unfair taxation practices imposed by other countries on American businesses.

The UK’s implementation of a “diverted profit tax” and a digital services tax has previously been identified by the US as examples of such unfair measures.

UHY Hacker Young partner and tax head Phil Kinzett-Evans said: “The amount of tax owed that HMRC suspects that US companies owe is continuing to grow at a scale that HMRC knows it can’t ignore.

“HMRC is under a lot of pressure help fill the shortfall in tax revenues by cracking down on large companies. However, that conflicts with the need to keep the US government onside but not to be seen as too aggressive towards US companies.

“HMRC needs to tread carefully as it faces the challenge of ensuring the UK keeps a good relationship current US administration whilst also investigating US companies for underpaying tax.

In sum – what to know:

SKT goes open source – SK Telecom released AX 3.1 Lite, a mobile-friendly Korean LLM, to an open-source AI hub to promote collaboration and open development.

Built for efficiency – The 7B-parameter model offers strong performance with lower power needs, optimized for mobile deployments and language-heavy apps like call assistants.

Korean LLM expertise – Developed from scratch, the model showcases SKT’s long-term investment in sovereign LLMs and local AI talent, with benchmark scores rivaling much larger models.

Koran carrier SK Telecom (SKT) has taken another step in its AI strategy by releasing AX 3.1 Lite, a compact large language model (LLM) designed for mobile applications, to the open-source AI hub Hugging Face, according to a Korean press report.

The new model, featuring 7 billion parameters, builds on the AX 3.0 Lite previously used in SKT’s A-dot AI call assistant and is part of the telco’s ongoing efforts to optimize LLMs for smartphones.

SK Telecom said AX 3.1 Lite offers Korean language capabilities on par with its larger sibling, AX 4.0 Lite, which has 72 billion parameters. The lightweight version achieved strong benchmark scores — 96% on the Korean language KMMLU2 test and 102% on CLIcK3, which measures cultural understanding, according to the report.

The company emphasized that AX 3.1 Lite was developed from scratch in-house, a continuation of a strategy that began in 2018.

The Korean carrier said the model will enable companies to deploy more efficient, power-conscious AI systems directly on mobile devices, especially where localised language processing is critical.

The model’s release via Hugging Face aims to encourage community feedback and collaboration, the reprot added.

Through its “AI Infrastructure Superhighway” and “AI Pyramid Strategy” initiatives, the Asian telco is investing heavily in AI data centers, cloud-based GPU services and edge computing to support the growing demands of AI applications and services.​

At the core of SK Telecom’s AI ambitions is the development of an “AI Infrastructure Superhighway,” a strategic initiative focused on three main components:​

-AI Data Centers (AIDCs): The carrier is constructing hyperscale AI data centers across South Korea, each designed to exceed 100 megawatts in capacity. These facilities aim to serve as central hubs for AI processing and storage, supporting both domestic and international AI workloads. ​

-GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS): To democratize access to high-performance computing, the company has launched a cloud-based GPU service. This platform allows businesses and developers to utilize powerful GPU resources on-demand, facilitating AI model training and deployment without the need for significant upfront hardware investments. ​

-Edge AI: Recognizing the importance of low-latency processing, the Asian telco is expanding its edge computing capabilities. By integrating AI processing closer to data sources, such as mobile devices and IoT sensors, the company aims to enhance real-time data analysis and decision-making across various applications.

​ SK Telecom previously said it experienced solid revenue growth in its artificial intelligence (AI) businesses, such as AI data centers (AIDC) and AI transformation (AIX), during the first quarter of the year.

In the first quarter, SK Telecom’s AIDC business recorded a 11.1% year-on-year increase, driven by increased data center capacity and utilization rates. AIDC is set to accelerate its push into hyperscale AIDC in the mid to long term, SK Telecom said.

In the AI services domain, the cumulative user base of the ‘A.’ (A-DoT) service surpassed 9 million. Meanwhile, ‘Aster’ (A*), SK Telecom’s global AI agent service, launched open beta testing in the U.S. at the end of March.

ArcelorMittal South Africa (Amsa), which continues to pay heavy prices for government infrastructure and policy failures, may be left with no option but to prepare for the wind down process of its Longs Business, well in advance of September 30, 2025.

This announcement, and despite a forecast of slightly reduced headline earnings losses for the six months to June 30, caused the share price to slump 7.89% to 105 cents on the JSE by Monday afternoon - considering that three years ago the price traded above R5 a share.

On March 31, Amsa announced its decision to wind down the Long Steel Business had been deferred for at least 6 months to September 30 after it received a R1.68 billion funding facility from the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC).

The facility was now fully drawn and would enable the Longs Business to operate through the third quarter. The business would also continue to trade until the end of September, having regard to the commitments made to its customers.

However, so far, “limited” progress was made to redress major structural issues, which was the main aim of the deferral period.

“High imports continue to flood into the domestic market. Transnet's rail performance deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk and unaffordable additional costs being borne by the company,” Amsa’s directors said.

The challenges that have faced the group over several years include structural distortions created by the Preferential Pricing System (PPS) and export tax on ferrous scrap in favour of scrap-based steel makers to the disadvantage of integrated steel makers, weak domestic demand, and the lack of growth projects for steel.

There is also insufficient import protection and continued circumvention of tariff protections by local companies, without prosecution.

The rail service performance remained poor with associated, high, globally uncompetitive and unaffordable tariffs. In addition, electricity tariffs were unaffordable and globally uncompetitive, they said.

On two occasions in the past six months, the risk of uncontrolled blast furnace stops arose due to major rail service interruptions, on account of an ""unprecedented spate of cable theft and locomotive failures.""

“Additional unplanned road transport had to be deployed, resulting in higher direct, operational and handling costs of R317 million for the period,” the group's directors said.

Since March, Amsa had been exploring options to address these challenges, while the IDC conducted due diligence into the company, and the government had been pursuing structural interventions, all of which were still ongoing, they said.

“Unless a solution is implemented timeously, and to ensure the orderly closure of the Longs Business as soon as possible after the deferral period, ArcelorMittal South Africa may have no option but to take certain operational steps to prepare for the wind down process well in advance of September 30, 2025.”

Meanwhile, the group predicted that earnings per share would improve 15% to a loss of between R0.82 and R0.93 a share for the six months to June 30, from a loss of R1.09 per share at the same time last year. The full interim results are expected to be released on July 31.

The group said a global cyclical downturn in the steel industry has continued now for almost two years, which is longer than the norm. Global crude steel production fell by 1.3% from January to May 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, according to the World Steel Association.

In South Africa, all sectors except agriculture contributed to a weaker annual GDP outlook, with tough trading conditions in key steel-consuming sectors: construction, automotive, mining, fabrication, and energy and transport.

First half sales volumes were expected to be about 10% down compared to 2024’s first half. Apart from lower demand, sales volumes for flat steel products continued to be affected by high import levels, whilst long steel product sales reflected the uncertainty around its continuation.

Net realised prices in rand terms were anticipated to be more than 5% lower, impacted in part by a stronger rand-dollar exchange rate.

The steel and manufacturing industry, represented by various industry associations, appeared before the portfolio committee responsible for trade, industry and competition on June 4, 2025.

The industry expressed disillusionment with policy developments and dissatisfaction with the continued decline of the steel sector, which is creating a challenging business and investment climate in South Africa.

Imports now represented more than 35% of apparent steel consumption and significantly undermined domestic supply.

These two financial hubs – in Dubai and Riyadh respectively – have become essential destinations.

African banking offices in the Arab world

Three major African banks have recently announced plans to either open or expand offices in these locations.

Even if global banks are present in the Gulf, they can no longer easily manage the entire corridor. This creates opportunities for African banks to step in

South Africa’s Absa Bank and Kenya’s Equity Bank will both establish offices at Dubai’s DIFC in early 2026, while Nigeria’s United Bank for Africa, already present at DIFC, plans to open an additional office at Riyadh’s KAFD by year-end.

“The primary rationale for these banks is following their clients’ growth ambitions. If major corporations are selling in the Middle East, banks must be there too,” says Frédéric Boutet, an associate director at Africa specialists Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Since 2016, African exports destined for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – comprising Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar – have grown faster than to any other region: up 145%, compared to 100% for China and 70% for the EU.

Dubai: Gateway to global markets

Equity Bank, ranked as Africa’s 16th-largest financial institution according to The Africa Report’s latest top 300 ranking, sees Dubai as integral to its strategic plans. Its goal is to build value chains across East and Central Africa by connecting these to global markets, with the UAE acting as a key entry point.

Equity CEO James Mwangi, alongside fellow banking chiefs Tony Elumelu (UBA) and Kenny Fihla (Absa Bank), recognises the importance of being present in the Arabian Peninsula. The region is a strategic marketplace where banks’ corporate clients find crucial business opportunities in energy, agriculture, and mining.

“Even if global banks are present in the Gulf, they can no longer easily manage the entire corridor. This creates opportunities for African banks to step in,” says Tijsbert Creemers-Chaturvedi, managing director and senior partner at BCG South Africa.

On 8 July, Emirati holding company NG9 agreed to a deal with authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Equity Bank and UBA have strong footholds, to finance a copper and cobalt refinery.

In May, Saudi energy firm ACWA pledged to invest R7bn (around $378m) over five years in water and energy projects, under an agreement with South Africa. African banks in the Gulf could act as co-arrangers for these initiatives.

Taking advantage of international bank withdrawals

Tijsbert Creemers-Chaturvedi, who leads BCG’s financial services practice in Africa, notes that major African banks are well-positioned to benefit from the development of these financial hubs, especially as global banks have struggled to sustain their African presence.

“BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, and Société Générale have closed branches. Even though these banks remain active in the Gulf, they no longer operate seamlessly across the entire Africa-Gulf corridor – African banks can therefore fill this gap.”

International banks see Africa as risky, politically and economically, leaving significant market opportunities open to continental banks.

Gulf nations also offer greater openness to diversified financing compared to their American and Chinese rivals.

A recent Afreximbank report highlights that “GCC investments focus on resource security and economic diversification, while American investment typically emphasises development initiatives and energy challenges. China’s strategy centres on the Belt and Road initiative, expanding markets and acquiring resources to boost trade and connectivity in Asia and Africa”.

A decisive part of African finance now unfolds in Dubai, shaped by East-West dialogue. Here, speed, robust legal frameworks, and deep markets are redefining capital flows

African banks thus stand to gain more than just following their corporate clients. The Middle East doesn’t only import – it invests substantially. Between 2012 and 2022, GCC countries injected $100bn into Africa. Investments between 2022 and 2023 alone reached $113bn, surpassing the previous decade. Over the next five years, investments are expected to range between $20bn and $30bn annually.

Diaspora: A new niche

African banks do not intend to compete directly with local Gulf banks for local customers. Yet, their presence unlocks another important niche: diaspora communities. In 2023, remittances from the Middle East accounted for 27% of total inflows into Africa, overtaking Western Europe’s 23%.

Money transfers from GCC nations to Kenya alone surpassed $3bn, significantly boosting foreign exchange reserves, according to Afreximbank.

Finally, at financial centres such as DIFC or KAFD, African banks aim to gain expertise in structured finance. Mastering these skills will allow them to become lead arrangers and bookrunners in major projects across Africa – roles currently dominated by international banks.

“African banks at DIFC find an ideal environment for creating special-purpose vehicles to structure debt portfolios, securitise trade flows, or set up debt funds, accessing institutional investors, family offices, and advanced compliance platforms,” says Moustafa Mourouvaye, CEO of Brweidge, a structured finance firm operating between Africa, Asia, and the Gulf.

“A decisive part of African finance now unfolds in Dubai, shaped by East-West dialogue. Here, speed, robust legal frameworks, and deep markets are redefining capital flows.”

Firms like Capgemini and HCL Tech are building moats with offshore talent, AI, and IoT expertise.","The global Product Engineering Services (PES) market is on a tear, projected to hit $1.8 trillion by 2030, growing at a 6.8% CAGR fueled by automotive electrification, IoT integration, and the rise of Asia Pacific's talent hubs. This isn't just another tech boom—it's a structural shift toward cost-efficient, AI-driven engineering that's rewriting the rules of product development. For investors, the question isn't whether to allocate capital here, but how quickly to act.

The Drivers: A Perfect Storm of Tech and Talent

The PES market's growth hinges on three pillars:

Automotive Electrification: Automakers are racing to modernize legacy systems for EVs, autonomous features, and “digital-first” consumer expectations. Partnerships like Tata Technologies' collaboration with BMW to build next-gen vehicle platforms are emblematic of this shift. Meanwhile, HCLTech's IoT-enabled vehicle-to-cloud integration and over-the-air updates are cornerstones of modernization.

IoT Integration: IoT isn't just a buzzword—it's a revenue engine. Businesses are embedding connected tech into products, from predictive maintenance systems in factories to telematics in cars. IoT engineering services are booming, with AI and edge computing enabling real-time data analysis.

Asia Pacific Talent Hubs: India's 1,700+ Global Capability Centers (GCCs) are the unsung heroes here. These hubs specialize in product engineering and platform modernization, leveraging 24/7 collaboration, AI-driven test automation, and cost efficiencies. North America leads in market share (thanks to aerospace and advanced manufacturing), but Asia Pacific's talent and scalability are its secret weapon.

The Winners: HCL Tech and Capgemini Are Leading the Charge

The firms best positioned to capitalize on this trend are those with offshore innovation centers and AI-driven engineering at their core. Let's dissect two leaders:

Capgemini: AI as the New Mainframe

Capgemini's Resonance AI Framework is a game-changer. Launched in July 2025, it uses generative AI to accelerate product modernization, with RAISE—a generative AI and AI agents gallery—already contributing 5% of bookings in Q4 2024. Their 6G lab in Gurugram and 5G lab in Mumbai are R&D powerhouses, while their CAALM (AI-Assisted Legacy Modernization) solution automates mainframe refactoring, cutting costs and time for clients like a U.S. life insurer that modernized its COBOL-based systems.

Capgemini's ESG commitments also stand out: 98% renewable energy usage, a 35% emissions reduction since 2019, and partnerships with tech giants like AWS and Mistral AI. This isn't just about profit—it's about future-proofing for a greener, smarter world.

HCL Tech: IoT and Automotive as Growth Engines

HCL's IoT-driven vehicle-to-cloud integration and over-the-air updates are direct responses to automakers' demands for agility. Their focus on model-based systems engineering and AI-driven test automation aligns with the need for faster, more reliable product cycles.

HCL's Global Delivery Model, with hubs in India and Eastern Europe, ensures scalability. Their partnership with Tata Technologies (BMW) and focus on cost-efficient talent pools give them an edge in a market where clients demand both innovation and affordability.

Why Act Now? The Clock Is Ticking

The urgency here is twofold:

1. Demand is outpacing supply: Automotive and IoT firms are desperate to modernize, but legacy systems are a bottleneck. Companies like Capgemini and HCL are the only ones with the tools to solve this at scale.

2. AI is a multiplier, not a fad: Generative AI isn't just a gimmick—it's slashing modernization timelines and costs. Firms that ignore this risk being left behind.

The Investment Case

This isn't a recommendation to “buy the dip.” It's a call to allocate capital now to companies at the forefront of PES modernization. Key metrics to watch:

- Capgemini: Track their AI bookings growth and CAALM adoption rates.

- HCL Tech: Monitor IoT and automotive revenue streams.

The window for cheap entry is narrowing. As automotive giants like GE Aerospace (which invested $1B in additive manufacturing) and IoT-heavy industries ramp up spending, PES providers will be the silent beneficiaries.

Final Take: Don't Miss the Boat

The PES market's 6.8% CAGR isn't just a number—it's a mandate. Firms like Capgemini and HCL Tech are building moats with offshore talent, AI, and IoT expertise. For investors, this is a decade-long opportunity. The question is: Will you be on the boat or left staring at the wake?

Action Items:

1. Add Capgemini and HCL Tech to your watchlist.

2. Monitor sector trends:

3. Act before the herd catches on—these companies are already ahead, but the best gains come early.

The next gold rush isn't in mines or crypto—it's in the engineers coding the future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-14 14:12:13.546247

Shares of Monogram more than doubled to $6.70 in premarket trading. WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Medical device makers, including larger peers Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson are seeking to strengthen their robotic surgery offerings.

The global market for robotic surgery devices is expected to be worth nearly $16 billion by the end of this decade, according to data analytics firm GlobalData.

The deal will allow Warsaw, Indiana-based Zimmer to broaden its robotics platform and gain access to Monogram’s semi-autonomous knee replacement technology, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2025. Zimmer expects to integrate Monogram’s technology and launch fully autonomous surgical robots and additional applications beyond prosthetic knee replacement by 2027.

BY THE NUMBERS

Monogram stockholders will receive $4.04 per share in cash upfront, which represents a premium of 22.8% to its last close. The terms also include up to $12.37 per share in contingent value rights, dependent on certain milestones being met by 2030.

Zimmer Biomet plans to fund the deal with a combination of cash and available debt financing.

WHAT’S NEXT

The deal is expected to close later this year. Zimmer expects the deal to be neutral to adjusted earnings per share until 2027, and accretive to earnings from 2028 onward.

Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s Varipulse platform treats AFib with a single device that combines PFA with the Carto 3 mapping system. Its variable-loop, multi-electrode Varipulse catheter uses laser-cut nitinol tubing for its loop shape. The platform also includes TruPulse generator and the Carto 3 3D cardiac mapping system.

The company joined Medtronic and Boston Scientific as companies with PFA technologies approved for treating AFib when it received an FDA nod in November 2024. Commercial activity hit a snag earlier this year when the company temporarily halted all U.S. cases using Varipulse in January. After reviewing four reported neurovascular events, the company resumed sales a month later.

At present, the company reports that it has now surpassed 10,000 Varipulse procedures across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Korea, Taiwan and Australia. It also notes that the platform has sustained a neurovascular adverse event rate of less than 0.5% to date.

Part 1 — Less than half of client-facing employees in public accounting were CPAs last year

The share of CPA-licensed staff working in public accounting firms dropped below 50% in 2024, according to Inside Public Accounting’s latest Data Dive. Research indicates that from 2020 to 2024, the average percentage of staff holding CPA licenses at said firms fell from 56% to 48.4%. At larger firms — where advisory and consulting services continue to expand as private equity money flows in — just over four in 10 (41.5%) of staff held CPA licenses in 2024.

Despite the trend occurring more frequently at larger firms, the decline spans firms of all sizes. This suggests a systemic change in credentialing trends, recruiting strategies and the makeup of public accounting teams — ideas CFOs have shared their thoughts on extensively.

As the accounting profession adapts to talent shortages, how the industry has done so has received mixed reviews. States are now lessening education requirements, while companies have been trying to change the way accountants are perceived through entertainment media and, most recently, highly criticized advertising campaigns from massive technology providers and public accounting firms.

On the inside, firms are increasingly hiring professionals without CPA licenses to fill roles once filled by credentialed or soon-to-be credentialed accountants. Many are also investing in AI tools to automate routine work in audit, tax and financial transformation, further shifting the types of skills they prioritize in new hires. It’s also worth noting that this shift is happening despite a recent, modest uptick in undergraduate accounting enrollment following several years of decline.

For CFOs, these staffing changes have implications beyond the firms themselves. Many finance leaders who rely on these firms for core services like audit, outsourced accounting and consulting expect a certain level of technical expertise. As firms broaden their talent mix, CFOs may need to re-evaluate how they engage with providers and what credentials and capabilities they prioritize when buying services from public accounting firms.

Unit share for private label products continued to grow, hitting 23.2% in the first half. This is a continuation seen over the past two years. In 2023, store brands unit share was 20.5%, rising to 22.9% in 2024.

January accounted for the first half’s largest gains in terms of dollar sales and unit sales. The month served as the inaugural Store Brand Month, a brainchild of PLMA. The initiative was designed to bring together retailers, manufacturers, and service providers to declare January as Store Brands Month.

By category, the largest growth in private label sales over the past 12 weeks were refrigerated foods up 10.5%, beverages up 4%, petcare up 2%, frozen food up 2%, and beauty up 1.6%.

The growth of private label sales during the first half is reflective of the continued growth of store brand products by several leading retailers. Target expanded its Good & Gather brand with the launch of its Collabs line, which features products developed with James Beard-Award winning chefs.

Albertsons this spring debuted its Chef’s Counter assortment, teaming with Chef Antonia Lofaso as its brand ambassador. The initial assortment includes a selection of ready-to-cook marinated meats priced from $4.99 for boneless pork loin chops in mesquite or garlic herb flavors to $12.69 for carne asada.

More recently, CVS revealed plans to overhaul its CVS Brand assortment with new packaging, and Kroger, which reported seven consecutive quarters of private label growth, announced it would introduce 80 new items under its Simple Truth brand.",https://storebrands.com/images/v/16_x_9_480/sb/2025-06/publix_pl_ice_cream.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:17:50.928429

A successful Circle trust bank would validate the model, encouraging competitors to seek their own national trust charter crypto approvals.","Is Circle launching a digital currency bank?

Circle, the fintech firm behind USDC, has filed an application with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to establish America’s first digital currency bank, a national trust institution that would bring stablecoins fully into the federally regulated financial system.

The proposed entity, First National Digital Currency Bank, wouldn’t operate like a traditional consumer bank. It wouldn’t offer deposits or loans. Instead, it would focus on Circle USDC trust bank functions: safeguarding USDC USDCUSD reserves, managing cash and short-term Treasury holdings and offering digital asset custody services to institutional clients.

Circle is becoming a serious contender in global finance. In fact, with over $62 billion in USDC in circulation, it’s the second-largest stablecoin globally.

Until now, reserve management relied on third-party custodians like BlackRock and BNY Mellon. By pursuing a Circle OCC charter application, Circle aims to internalize control, streamline operations, minimize risk and strengthen transparency.

It also aligns Circle with current legislation. The GENIUS Act, passed by the US Senate in June 2025, sets a new bar for regulated stablecoin infrastructure: 1:1 reserve backing, monthly attestations and federal oversight.

By applying for a federal trust charter, Circle shows it’s ready to meet (and help define) future US standards for digital currency banking.

Did you know? In 2024, USDC overtook Tether’s USDt (USDT) in onchain transaction volume (despite being smaller in market capitalization).

Why Circle’s Federal Charter matters for stablecoins and institutional crypto

A federal charter gives Circle regulatory credibility, full control over USDC reserves and the ability to offer secure custody services to institutions.

A stronger regulatory footing

A federal OCC trust charter would immediately improve Circle’s position.

Rather than operating as a BitLicense-only entity or depending on state-by-state clarity, Circle would become a federally regulated bank subject to OCC and Federal Reserve oversight.

For institutions wary of dealing with crypto-native firms, this change demonstrates compliance, permanence and trust, following in the steps taken by Anchorage Digital (currently the only other firm with a crypto bank charter) but with far broader implications, given USDC’s adoption.

Analysts suggest the charter could bolster Circle investor confidence, enabling broader partnerships across banking, fintech and capital markets.

Full control over USDC reserve management

Gaining a national trust charter would bring Circle’s $62.1 billion of reserves in-house. This means Circle can directly oversee the assets that back its stablecoin, adding operational efficiency while reducing counterparty risk.

As trust in stablecoins increasingly hinges on how reserves are held and reported, this move gives Circle stronger guarantees around security, liquidity and compliance with both US and international standards, like Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) compliance and the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation.

Opening new institutional services

As explored, Circle’s new trust wouldn’t offer deposits or retail lending. It would, however, unlock a suite of business-to-business opportunities.

With federal approval, Circle could expand its digital asset custody services — not just for USDC, but for tokenized assets, corporate treasuries and other blockchain-based financial instruments.

In doing so, Circle would develop into payment infrastructure, bridging traditional finance and Web3.

As firms across the globe, from Europe to the United Arab Emirates, pursue licenses (such as the Abu Dhabi crypto license), Circle’s US-based trust bank could serve as a model of how to structurally align with both US stablecoin legislation and global compliance norms.

Did you know? Circle earned roughly $1.7 billion in interest income in 2024 — almost all from holding USDC reserve assets.

Is it the right time for a Circle federally regulated bank?

With investor confidence surging after Circle’s blockbuster initial public offering (IPO) and new federal rules giving stablecoins a regulatory path forward, the conditions are finally right to launch a fully regulated digital currency bank.

Circle’s June 5 debut on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker: CRCL) sent a clear message that markets are ready to back a regulated stablecoin issuer.

The stock opened at $69 — more than doubling its $31 listing price — and briefly topped $100 before settling at $83. That day, Circle NYSE IPO CRCL closed with a market cap near $6.9 billion and nearly 200% growth, reflecting soaring demand for companies that sit at the intersection of TradFi and DeFi.

At the same time, Washington gave its strongest nod yet to stablecoin regulation. As touched upon, the GENIUS Act stablecoin regulation, passed by the Senate just 12 days after Circle’s IPO, set out comprehensive guardrails: 1:1 dollar backing, real-time attestations and oversight by federal banking regulators such as the OCC.

Under Acting Comptroller Rodney Hood, the agency has signaled support for responsible crypto integration, especially through the Circle OCC charter application process.

With this in mind, Circle’s decision to pursue America’s first digital currency bank feels like a precisely calculated one.

Did you know? Stablecoins facilitated an estimated $27.6 trillion in transactions in 2024, surpassing the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard by about 7.7%

Impacts of the Circle federally regulated bank

Circle’s bank could unlock institutional access, fuel USDC adoption and transmute how stablecoins fit into the global financial system.

Bridging stablecoins and traditional institutions

As a federally regulated bank, Circle would act as connective tissue between crypto and established finance. Pension funds, asset managers and insurers often require federally supervised partners before engaging in digital assets. A Circle digital currency bank, governed under OCC oversight, could unlock these channels.

Moreover, just as money market funds became mainstream after tighter rules boosted trust, Circle aims to make USDC reserve management a benchmark for stability.

Accelerating real-world stablecoin use

One key advantage of a Circle stablecoin bank is flawless integration. Institutional-grade digital asset custody services would support tokenized securities, real-time payments and programmable finance.

With partners like Visa, Stripe and BlackRock already experimenting with Circle payment infrastructure, the next phase is deeper adoption — OAuth-style plug-and-play modules that let banks and fintechs offer USDC without friction.

Industry-wide impacts

Circle’s charter could pave the way for a new category of federally recognized crypto bank charter holders.

Legacy firms like JPMorgan and Bank of America are reportedly working on jointly issuing a stablecoin. A successful Circle trust bank would validate the model, encouraging competitors to seek their own national trust charter crypto approvals.

In terms of the broader impact, we can expect stronger interoperability, better compliance frameworks and greater Circle investor confidence. Whether for regulators, institutions or global partners (like those pursuing MiCA compliance or Abu Dhabi crypto license equivalents), Circle’s move sets a precedent that stablecoins can evolve into bank-grade, regulated infrastructure.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:18:58.049283

While there have been a smattering of second quarter earnings trickling out in the past two weeks, they begin to roll out in earnest this week, starting, as always, with large banks and financial companies.

On Tuesday morning, five mega banks report Q2 earnings, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), and State Street (NYSE:STT). Also, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) releases its first quarter results.

On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), PNC (NYSE:PNC), Bank (NYSE:MTB), and First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) follow suit.

Other notable banks to report this week are US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) on Thursday. Finally, American Express (NYSE:AXP), Ally (NYSE:ALLY), Charles Schwab (NASDAQ:SCHW), Truist (NYSE:TFC), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF) and Comerica (NYSE:CMA) report Friday.

What should we expect? Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck anticipates investment banking, trading volumes, and higher asset levels to lead the Q2 growth. M&A activity was up 30% in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago, while trading volume rose 49% year-over-year, wrote Graseck in a research note, according to Seeking Alpha. In addition, the Nasdaq gained some 13% in Q2 while the S&P 500 gained roughly 4%.

These results should spur higher revenue and earnings from these banks and financial firms. Banks could also see lower loss provisions due to an improved economic outlook compared to Q1.

Netflix expected to have strong quarter

While banks are in the spotlight, there are some other significant names to report earnings this week, starting with streaming leader Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on Thursday. Analysts expect earnings of $7.06 per share on revenue of $11.04 billion.

Analysts at Wedbush are even more bullish, calling for earnings of $7.18 per share on revenue of $11.16 billion.

“Given the strong backdrop heading into the second half of 2025, we believe Netflix will be well-positioned to exceed its Q2 guidance and provide solid guidance for the remainder of the year,” Wedbush analyst Alicia Reese wrote in a research note, according to Kiplinger’s.

Other notable earnings this week are grocery store chain Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) on Tuesday; semiconductor firm ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), United Airlines (NYSE:UAL), and consumer staple Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on Wednesday; Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), and PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP) on Thursday, and chemical company 3M (NYSE:MMM) on Friday.

CPI inflation this week

Aside from the earnings kick off, there are two major economic reports to drop this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday. CPI inflation rose in May to 2.4%, marking the first time since January it has gone up.

With the tariffs in full effect, economists expect inflation to rise again in June, with the consensus targeting 2.7% inflation and 3.0% core CPI inflation. The core CPI would be up from 2.8% in May.

The direction of inflation, and the size of any move one way or another, could have a major impact on what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates when it meets on July 30.

The other key economic report to come this week is Retail Sales on Thursday. In May, retail sales actually declined by 0.9%, performing worse than expected, as consumers were cautious in uncertain economic conditions and wary of price hikes. In June, economists project retail sales to increase 0.2%.",https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/banks_1554265923-150x150.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:20:48.742769

That means production must be efficient to avoid passing excess costs on to the market.","Danone is close to meeting its global sugar-reduction target in Brazil. A new version of its children’s product Danoninho, set to launch in August, will help align the Brazilian portfolio with the company’s goal: by 2025, 95% of its children’s products must contain no more than 10% sugar. Currently, one cup contains 11.5% sugar, above the World Health Organization’s recommendation that sugar make up no more than 10% of total calorie intake.

“This reduction couldn’t come at the expense of flavor, otherwise people would stop buying,” said Isabelle Esser, Danone’s executive vice president for human resources, research and innovation, food quality and safety. She said the change in formula reflects investments in innovations using fermentation cultures that help deliver texture, flavor, and natural sweetness.

In 2024, the company invested €447 million in research and development, a 12.3% increase from 2023, according to its financial report. Danone’s global innovation team has 1,700 people, including 45 in Brazil. The country ranks as Danone’s 10th-largest market, with estimated annual revenue of $1 billion. The U.S. leads the ranking with $6 billion, followed by China with $3 billion.

Danone’s main revenue sources are dairy and plant-based beverages, specialized nutrition, and bottled water, including brands like Evian. “Brazil is considered a strategic market with strong growth potential,” said Gustavo Alvarez, director of research and innovation for Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.

Founded 106 years ago to help address childhood digestive issues through food, Danone has recently focused on targeted nutrition. One recent launch in Indonesia includes ingredients that enhance iron absorption, helping treat anemia.

In China, the company introduced a beverage designed to restore gut microbiota diversity—microorganisms in the digestive system—as a way to promote longevity.

Much of Danone’s research is conducted at the Paris-Saclay science and technology cluster, nicknamed the “Silicon Valley of France”, where it operates a research center focused on dairy and plant-based foods. The company developed 130 products there last year and expects to match that output in 2025.

The 21,000-square-meter facility includes laboratories with 1,900 types of fermentation cultures, a pilot factory, and testing rooms where consumers sample innovations and share feedback. A second center in the Netherlands specializes in medical nutrition products, such as supplements for cancer patients.

Danone is also using artificial intelligence to study the more than 100 trillion microorganisms that make up the microbiota. These findings are analyzed at D-Lab in Singapore, which also handles open data analysis. The digital innovation lab has received over €30 million in funding over the past five years.

Biotechnology investments come at a time when global food systems face major challenges, including limited natural resources to produce both animal and plant-based protein. “Science is emerging as an alternative. But most consumers aren’t willing to pay more for sustainable or low-carbon products, it’s just a bonus to them,” Ms. Esser noted.

That means production must be efficient to avoid passing excess costs on to the market. At Danone’s automated plant in Bailleul, France, 5 million yogurt cups are produced daily, 96% of which are consumed domestically, where yogurt is typically eaten as dessert. In the first quarter, Danone’s global sales rose 0.8% to €6.84 billion.

What does this mean?

ArcelorMittal’s South African division is facing tough times, with its long steel operations on the brink due to weak local demand and stiff competition. High electricity prices and inefficient freight logistics worsen the situation, pushing the company toward controversial plant closures. Government discussions are ongoing to prevent these closures, even after previous financial relief from the Industrial Development Corporation. Imports now supply over 35% of local steel needs, and with faltering logistics services, ArcelorMittal's challenges are growing. The firm showed slight improvement in expected headline losses per share, but sales volumes fell 10% in early 2025. Their half-year financial results, due July 31, will reveal more.

Why should I care?

For markets: Industry staples under pressure.

ArcelorMittal's troubles highlight broader issues in South Africa's industrial sector. Escalating operational costs and import dominance are red flags for similar firms, potentially reshaping which sectors investors should monitor. Steel, a backbone for construction and manufacturing, now demands careful watch amid global competition and local inefficiencies.

The bigger picture: Shifting foundations in global trade.

The challenges faced by ArcelorMittal underscore larger trends in global trade dynamics.

Monogram’s rapid-fire FDA green light for its knee tech just four months back, plus plans for wider robot-assisted surgeries, could help Zimmer leapfrog into the next wave of healthcare innovation. Investors took notice: Monogram shares more than doubled after the news, trading up to $6.70 premarket. The buyout is set to be earnings-neutral for Zimmer until 2027, before lifting profits from 2028 – pointing to a bet that robotics will reshape surgery long term.

Why should I care?

For markets: Surgical tech sharpens investor focus.

The robotic surgery market is drawing big money, as hospitals chase greater precision and improved patient outcomes. According to GlobalData, the sector looks on track to reach $16 billion by 2030. Zimmer Biomet’s $177 million price tag for Monogram – a 22.8% premium to its last close – highlights strong appetite for innovation in medtech. By funding the deal with a mix of cash and debt, Zimmer is banking on tech-fueled growth to deliver returns, echoing investor hopes that breakthroughs in health tech will set new paths for the industry.

The assets spun off could house the retail portions of the company’s ""protect"" and ""balance"" platforms.

Stifel's analysts quantified the accelerate platforms as including condiments, ready-meals brands Mac & Cheese and Ore-Ida, plus snacking lines such as Lunchables and Delimex.

The assets that could be spun off would include Oscar Mayer meats, Jell-O desserts, drinks brands Capri-Sun and Kool-Aid, cheese with Kraft and Velveeta, plus coffee, as in Maxwell House and Gevalia.

Meanwhile, Peter McDonald, a food-industry consultant and former General Mills executive of 20-plus years, weighed in on the failed merger angle of 2015 in what he described as one of the “darkest chapters in CPG food during my career”.

McDonald explained his thoughts in a LinkedIn post: “The new entity pursued a new-to-the-industry aggressive margin expansion playbook that sent competitors chasing ‘zero-based budgeting’ and other nonsensical corporate initiatives in a desperate attempt to avoid being gobbled up themselves.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017. Since then, food-industry reality has reasserted itself and the margin extraction from innovation, marketing, talent, and pricing aggression has taken its toll,” he wrote, putting Kraft Heinz’s current enterprise value at $50bn.

And acknowledging the reports of a spin-off are only based on speculation at this point, he added: “Now the company may be broken up into constituent parts not unlike things were when the whole fiasco started”.

Sales pressure

Kraft Heinz’s 2024 reported sales dropped 3% to $25.85bn, with organic growth down 2.1% in what CEO Abrams-Rivera described as “a challenging year with our top-line results coming in below our expectations”.

Net income fell to $2.74bn, from the $2.86bn booked for 2023. The company also reported a 63.2% slump in full-year operating profit to $1.7bn, which was linked to $3.7bn in non-cash impairment losses.

It was a poor performance echoed in the opening quarter of 2025, too. Net sales dropped 6.4% on a reported basis and declined 4.7% in organic terms to just shy of $7bn. In the three months to 29 March, operating income decreased 8.1% to $1.2bn.

Net income stood at $712m versus $801m a year earlier.

Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.

Kellogg demerger

“There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.

“The company has not set a timetable for completion of this process and does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the process unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”

Picking up on the WSJ report, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow estimated the likely valuation of the part of the Kraft Heinz grocery business spin-off at $14.5bn, short of the $20bn put forward by the publication.

He, too, linked his observations to the Kellogg demerger. “Bankers and board members of the food industry certainly have noticed the value capture of the 2023 Kellogg split up. After accounting for the Mars and Ferrero acquisitions of the two parts, investors will have realised 41% since the spin, while consumer staples stocks (by our math) fell 6% and fundamentals deteriorated due to changes in consumer preferences and external factors like GLP-1s,” Moskow wrote in a research note.

The TD Cowen analyst also speculated a buyer might step in – whether that’s Kraft Heinz’s intention or not – to snap up the offload, naming McCormick as a potential suitor.

“Our sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates 11% upside to KHC's current enterprise value based on eight times EV/EBITDA for grocery and 10.5x EV/EBITDA for sauces, condiments and spreads,” Moskow suggested.

“However, we could see another 20% upside if a strategic acquirer steps up to buy the sauces and condiments business (about 44% of KHC sales), which will look a lot like the original pre-merger Heinz business of 2013. For example, we see a good strategic fit with McCormick, which has been expanding into the condiments space for several years through tack-on deals, and a high degree of EPS accretion.”

Moskow added to his thesis by explaining that “mega-mergers in food have low success rates and that ‘depth’ tends to beat ‘breadth’”.

He continued: “The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable, and snacks) tend to differ.

“We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.”

Back to 2015

A common theme emanating from food-industry analysts is the throw back to the pre-2015 merger, what AllianceBernstein’s Alexia Howard deemed as a “reversal”.

“When we looked into the relative growth rates of the legacy Heinz company since the companies were merged in 2015, it looks as though the legacy Heinz business has grown retail sales at a 5.3% CAGR over the past decade, while the legacy Kraft brands have grown at only 2%,” Howard wrote in a research note.

“Looking at how the company could break up might mean that the remaining faster-growing company comprises the 25% of companywide sales in international markets plus another 30% of the 75% of the US sales for a total of around 47.5% of companywide sales.”

Howard explained further: “Looking at how the sales could break down, it seems that the faster-growing remaining company could represent around 47.5% of company-wide sales. Clearly, the margins in the international markets are significantly lower than in North America, which could mean that 38.2% of the total company’s adjusted EBITDA of $6.36bn in 2024 potentially sits with the faster-growing remaining company, while the remaining 61.8% sits with the spin-off.”

The Stifel analysts added: “The hypothetical slower growth ‘Spin Co’ would incorporate the retail protect platform featuring a projected low-single digit, ten-year, industry CAGR, high gross margins and low private-label penetration, as well as the retail balance commoditised business platform featuring a flat projected ten-year industry CAGR, low gross margins, and high private-label penetration.

“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.”

In a world where business decisions are ultimately based on revenue, sales and profits, circular business models are often siloed in sustainability strategies. To mitigate this reality, many fashion businesses are shifting their success metrics to provide clear, quantifiable evidence of how these models unlock resilience and competitiveness.

The Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s latest project — The Fashion ReModel — is working with leading brands, from high-street to high-end, on what it will take to implement circular business models at scale and begin to make the economics work, while also targeting key intervention points to improve commercial viability.

One year into the project, insights reveal which success metrics are most effective for building a compelling business case that drives internal buy-in and brings stakeholders on board.

Establish a revenue-based ambition for circular business models

Resale, rental, repair and remaking models enable businesses to offer new services, providing multiple revenue streams from one product. At the same time, costs can be reduced due to savings from better resource productivity and risk reduction. What the industry is missing is a meaningful metric to demonstrate the contribution of these models to a business’ overall revenue.

Participants of The Fashion ReModel are working towards their own revenue ambitions to increase the percentage of their total revenue derived from circular business models. By using gross percentage revenue, these brands and retailers have moved the success of circular business models into the core of their businesses, with a clear metric to monitor and align around.

H&M Group, for example, has invested in resale models to create additional growth. In 2024, resell sales represented 0.6 percent of H&M Group’s total turnover, up from 0.3 percent in 2022. Contributing to this growth is Sellpy, Europe’s largest secondhand clothing peer-to-peer platform. Sellpy has significantly increased its revenue contribution to H&M, doubling its share since 2022.

Identify new ways to articulate value — starting with customer benefits

In today’s linear system, the profit margins of circular business models can appear lower when compared like-for-like with linear models. The Fashion ReModel partnered with the NYU Stern Center for Sustainable Business to identify several benefits areas that showcase how circular models can drive business resilience in ways businesses aren’t currently tracking.

One of the critical areas identified is customer benefits. Circular business models offer an opportunity to diversify the relationship with the customer — improving loyalty, engagement and acquisition. Businesses can rethink their customer experiences, designing touchpoints beyond a single product sale.

Arc’teryx, for example, is capitalizing on this opportunity to tap into new customer bases. Its platform for resale and repair services, ReBIRD, has doubled its business year-on-year. Customers can visit ReBIRD Service Centers in stores to assess, wash or repair their product, keeping clothing in the loop and out of landfill.

Quantify the climate mitigation opportunity

With over 500 textiles, apparel, and footwear companies committed to science-based targets or commitments, circular business models offer an opportunity to deliver and demonstrate progress on ambitions by displacing upstream production and keeping products in use for longer, thereby cutting emissions.

Some organizations participating in The Fashion ReModel are using a combination of climate metrics to quantify this impact and further strengthen the business case. Absolute emissions, in particular, is the only metric able to evidence whether businesses are on track to meet decarbonization ambitions.

Take Coach’s Soho denim bag, a product that has been both commercially successful and lowered carbon emissions. It was created by two brands with a long history of reuse and repair. Tapestry (the parent company of Coach) partnered with Bank & Vogue (Canada’s largest secondhand clothing trader) to demonstrate how remaking products out of post-consumer existing denim has a lower environmental impact.

To quantify this, Tapestry commissioned a life-cycle assessment which found that Bank & Vogue’s repurposed denim has up to an 80 percent reduction in GHG emissions compared with conventional first-use denim. With this data, Tapestry can show this product’s ability to help meet its ambitious goal to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Largest expected beats, misses

Analysts predict Expand Energy Corp. will post the widest normalized EPS beat against expectations in its second-quarter earnings report on July 29, with the predicted $1.34 per share well outpacing the 1 cent normalized EPS reported in the same quarter of 2024.

Albemarle Corp., meanwhile, is forecast to post the largest annual decline in second-quarter earnings, swinging to a normalized loss per share of 67 cents from EPS of 4 cents a year earlier. In a first-quarter earnings release, Albemarle maintained its fiscal 2025 earnings outlook, citing exemptions on tariffs for certain critical minerals that offered a degree of certainty amid an unclear global trade picture.

Most of Magnificent 7 likely to grow as smaller companies struggle

The S&P 500's largest stocks at the end of the second quarter — NVIDIA, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. — are all expected to post normalized EPS gains year over year on higher revenues, according to Market Intelligence data. The companies are all part of the market-driving ""Magnificent Seven"" group, that also includes Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc.

Analysts predict Meta's normalized EPS will rise by about 13% to $5.83, though Tesla's earnings are forecast to fall by more than 19% on an expected drop in revenue.

He’s expected to testify about fallout at Facebook’s parent company from the Cambridge Analytica data mining scandal, in a trial starting Wednesday at the state’s Chancery Court. Meta settled similar class action claims in a California federal court in 2022.

The company may view the derivative case as good for them, win or lose. The claims at issue are notoriously difficult to prove, and the trial comes as Meta explores other states for its corporate home in the wake of unpopular Chancery rulings blamed for pushing Tesla Inc., Dropbox Inc., and other companies out of Delaware.

“Maybe they think the possible threat of them also leaving is enough to sway the court to rule their way and they don’t need to settle anymore,” Southern Methodist University law professor Carliss Chatman said. “Or maybe they want a bad decision so they can justify to the shareholders why they’re moving.”

‘Caremark’ Claims

The main claims in the trial are named for the 1996 Chancery ruling in In re Caremark Int’l Inc. Derivative Litig., which set parameters for oversight liability under Delaware law.

A group of pension funds allege Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg led Facebook to violate a 2012 Federal Trade Commission consent order regarding data sharing. Facebook’s board also failed to monitor the platform’s compliance, they say. They also accuse Zuckerberg of insider trading.

The Delaware lawsuit predates the company’s $5 billion settlement with the FTC in 2019 over policies that allowed Cambridge Analytica, a UK consulting firm linked to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, to acquire data from 87 million Facebook users. The pension funds say the board approved the accord to shield Zuckerberg from personal liability.

The FTC’s fine may have been crucial to the court’s 2023 decision allowing the claims to survive a motion to dismiss, but Zuckerberg’s and Sandberg’s high-profile personalities also likely advanced the case, Chatman said.

When corporate leaders’ identities become entwined with the branding, “it kind of makes sense that the Caremark claims should survive, because they give the public the perception that they are more aware and more involved in the company than a typical CEO,” she said. “It feels more like things are their personal decisions.”

Facebook thrived after reaching the FTC settlement, according to the defendants. It invested over $8 billion in its privacy program and preserved Zuckerberg’s reputation, they said.

“Cambridge Analytica was decidedly a traumatic episode for Facebook and its stockholders,” they said. “But it was the product of Cambridge Analytica’s studied deceit—not remotely the product of the bad faith inattention of Facebook’s fiduciaries.”

Evidence and Guidance

Earlier this year, the court sanctioned Sandberg over deleted emails. How the court handles the evidence will be interesting, said Joshua Newcomer of McKool Smith.

“The genesis of Caremark is lack of controls, right? So what does it say, if one of the board members is using personal email and the other board members go along with that, about the overall narrative of control?” Corporate attorneys and their clients want to know what remedies the court could impose if it finds the evidence points to a legal violation, he said.

“I really am going to be looking to see whether the Texas courts take any guidance from the Delaware courts regarding the appropriate relief at the end of a Caremark trial, particularly where the company has already made some adjustments, and whether that’s good evidence or bad evidence for the company,” Newcomer said. “And then what it means in terms of any order for remedial oversight requirements at the company, as opposed to just monetary damages.”

Other companies shouldn’t have anything to worry about so long as their internal controls are implemented in good faith, he said.

Dexit Drama

The trial is being overseen by Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick, who took over the case in March without explanation, years into litigation that had been before Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster.

The two judges have been lauded as “fearless,” but they’ve also weathered personal attacks from Elon Musk and other critics who believe their rulings illustrate a bias toward minority shareholders.

The venture capital firm co-founded by Meta director Marc Andreessen, who’s expected to testify during trial, cited “an unprecedented level of subjectivity” from the Chancery Court in its decision to relocate to Nevada.

Delaware lawmakers rewrote its corporate statutes in the last couple years in response to rulings by McCormick and Laster. Public records showed Meta executives participated in backroom meetings that led to a new law this year that lowered judge-made guardrails around insider deals, narrowed the definition of a “controlling stockholder,” and limited shareholder access to director texts and emails.

Meta might feel confident because of the unusual outside pressure that any judge in McCormick’s situation would have to acknowledge, said Renee Zaytsev of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.

The tech giant might expect “that a court is going to be wary about putting out another decision against another really big company,” she said.

However McCormick eventually rules—a decision would follow months after post-trial arguments—the stakes are high for Delaware’s attempts to portray itself as balancing the needs of shareholders with those of corporate leaders.

A pro-Meta outcome would send a strong signal that Delaware is pro-company. With a ruling against Meta, however, “I think you’re going to hear renewed discussions about how Delaware remains an unfriendly place for companies,” Zaytsev said.

Digital sales have proven to be crucial to grocery industry growth over the past year.
Albertsons launched its first-party digital experiences through its app just four years ago, and has been working to catch up to its competitors since then, Jill Pavlovich, SVP of digital shopping experiences at Albertsons, who oversees the grocer’s app, website, and in-store digital offerings, told Retail Brew.
Digital native: Four platforms—e-commerce, loyalty, pharmacy and health, and its mobile app—have been key to its blossoming digital business, Sankaran said in January.
Pavlovich is hopeful that customers will be receptive to digital in-store screens, though she noted the grocer has had “varying successes” with other innovations.","Since its highly publicized breakup with Kroger in December, Albertsons has been on a journey to prove that it’s just fine on its own.

The grocer has managed to get its “mojo” back, per former CEO Vivek Sankaran, in part by doubling down on its digital business to help it compete with giants like Walmart and Costco. Albertsons’ digital sales rose 24% YoY in Q4, the company reported in April, while its loyalty members jumped 15% to 45.6 million.

Digital sales have proven to be crucial to grocery industry growth over the past year. E-grocery sales surged during the Covid-19 pandemic, then cooled between 2021 and mid-2024 as shoppers returned to IRL shopping. But sales have picked back up again in the past year as retailers double down on promotions for their pickup and delivery services. Sales jumped 27% YoY to $8.7 billion in May, according to Brick Meets Click.

Albertsons launched its first-party digital experiences through its app just four years ago, and has been working to catch up to its competitors since then, Jill Pavlovich, SVP of digital shopping experiences at Albertsons, who oversees the grocer’s app, website, and in-store digital offerings, told Retail Brew.

“As we think about this year, the path that we have ahead of us, it’s really taking what we’ve developed a step farther and really bringing the digital experiences more deeply into stores,” she said.

Digital native: Four platforms—e-commerce, loyalty, pharmacy and health, and its mobile app—have been key to its blossoming digital business, Sankaran said in January.

Albertsons’s mobile app has served as a “Swiss Army knife of tools” to help shoppers, Pavlovich said, adding that last year was centered around “strengthen[ing] the core” and focusing on the “basics,” with updates that included in-store geolocation with real-time coupons. It’s also recently added a capability for consumers to upload their own recipes or recipes they’ve found online into the app and, using generative AI, digitize them, making the recipes shoppable across Albertsons’s offerings.

“This year is all about taking the things that reduce the cognitive load and taking them a step farther, leveraging the rate at which technology is changing to really give our customers a human multiplier—make it super easy for them to shop with us,” she said.

Daily monitoring of call service logs, checking reviews in the App Store and Google Play Store, and connecting with customers (and non-customers) directly to get their feedback helps the retailer establish both its annual digital product roadmap as well as make any real time adjustments necessary, Pavlovich said.

That continual iteration is necessary as more tech-savvy, younger consumers opt for online shopping for themselves and their early-stage families for the first time, she noted.

“Their expectation of technology is omnichannel experiences, so they have a lot less barriers to entry to engage digitally and convert online,” she said. “If we continue to keep up with our customer and meet their needs through our digital and omnichannel experiences, we’ll see that growth continue for Albertsons and also for the industry as well.”

As Albertsons takes on online grocery leaders like Walmart and Amazon, Pavlovich said its loyalty program (which it streamlined last year) and its “differentiated services” including special occasion planning offerings like catering and party supplies, will help it compete. This year, the grocer aims to add digital ordering capabilities for in-store services like its bakery and floral department, she noted.

Sharp as a tech: Albertsons also announced at Cannes Lions this year that it’s piloting in-store digital ad displays as it looks to grow the reach of its retail media network Albertsons Media Collective. The pilot is in its early days, but Pavlovich said “initial feedback is positive” as the grocer aims to use ads to boost discovery and brand awareness for shoppers.

“It’s not just an ad to be an ad; it really has to aid in the customer shopping journey and purchasing decision,” she said.

Pavlovich is hopeful that customers will be receptive to digital in-store screens, though she noted the grocer has had “varying successes” with other innovations. The in-store mode for its app has been a bright spot, quickly adopted by 10 million customers, Pavlovich said. However, checkout options similar to Amazon’s Just Walk Out technology, which the grocer previously piloted, hasn’t been so well-received.

""It’s been very experience-dependent, and we just continue to watch and keep a pulse, because the trends continue to emerge, and we’re learning of adoption in other industries or from other retailers,” she said. “We want to make sure that we keep up and we try again.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/deae628cabd516381a36c88247ff2c9d973e39cf-5197x3000.jpg?rect=0,135,5197,2728&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-07-14 11:08:43.330504

CVS is also exiting the individual health insurance business, leaving about 1 million Aetna members in 17 states looking for new coverage in 2026.","For years now, UnitedHealth Group has been the first of the major health insurers to report its quarterly earnings. And Wall Street analysts and investors have looked to the healthcare giant -- which owns the nation’s largest health insurer – for clues on how the sector is doing.

But not this week.

On Thursday, Elevance Health, the nation’s second largest health insurer, will be the first health insurer out of the box to report second quarter earnings as rivals reel or recover from higher-than-expected medical costs. UnitedHealth isn’t reporting its second quarter earnings until the end of the month.

Much is at stake. The Elevance Health report comes after government-subsidized health insurance provider Centene withdrew its 2025 financial guidance earlier this month due to higher costs in the individual health plans it sells under the Affordable Care Act as well as rising expenses from enrollees in its Medicaid plans.

Centene’s announcement was only the latest from a parade of health insurance companies that have struggled in the last two years to control costs of subscribers in plans subsidized by the government. Just last week, Molina Healthcare lowered its earnings guidance for the rest of the year in the face of cost pressures in all three of the government-subsidized health insurance programs it helps manage: Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and individual coverage under the ACA, also known as Obamacare.

And in May, UnitedHealth suspended its financial outlook for the rest of the year and replaced its top executive as the parent of UnitedHealthcare grapples with rising healthcare costs in its Medicare Advantage business. Medicare Advantage plans contract with the federal government to provide health benefits to seniors.

Medicare Advantage plans also contributed to struggles last year for Humana and CVS Health, which elevated a new chief executive in part to help gain control of its struggling Aetna health insurance business. CVS is also exiting the individual health insurance business, leaving about 1 million Aetna members in 17 states looking for new coverage in 2026.

In Elevance Health’s case, chief executive officer Gail Boudreaux, has kept the company’s portfolio of health insurance businesses diversified and somewhat free of issues that have dogged some of its rivals with more than half of its health plan membership coming from commercial or employer group accounts.

Elevance operates a healthy commercial business and is best know for its operation of Anthem brand Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states. In addition, Elevance manages Medicaid via contracts with multiple states and also sells individual coverage under the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare.

Analysts at GimmeCredit noted in a report in late April that Elevance’s Medicare Advantage book of business is “considerably smaller than UnitedHealth’s with 2.3 million members, according for 5% of its member mix, of which 15% is group Medicare Advantage.”

Still, Elevance does have exposure to some of the issues its rivals have faced with more than 8 million Americans enrolled in its Medicaid plans and more than 1 million enrolled in individual coverage under the ACA.

“We are constructive on Elevance for its diverse member mix, balance between commercial and government businesses, franchise value and brand recognition in 14 key states through its licenses with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, and efforts to diversify and expand services at Carelon,” GimmeCredit analyst Terri Cancelarich wrote in April.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/634fd98138f2f6f4c4c9a291/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-14 11:09:12.245924

ABT Q2 Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $11.07 billion, suggesting a 6.7% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for EPS is pinned at $1.25, indicating a 9.6% improvement from the prior-year registered figure.

Estimate Revision Trend Ahead of Earnings

Estimates for Q2 earnings have remained unchanged at $1.25 per share in the past 30 days.

Let's look at how things might have progressed for the MedTech major prior to the announcement.

Diagnostics: Similar to the previous quarters, we expect the segment’s revenue growth to have been impacted by the year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing revenues.

However, the Diagnostics arm is expected to have benefited from the widespread adoption of its top-tier systems and high testing demand across a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, retail pharmacies and blood screening facilities.

In the core lab business, continued global demand for routine diagnostic testing and continued adoption of the company’s market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology and blood screening testing panels, including recent large account wins, are likely to have helped sustain growth in the second quarter. The rapid diagnostics business is expected to have gained from the continued expansion of test menus and the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional healthcare settings.

Going by the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Diagnostics second-quarter revenues are likely to increase 0.1% year over year.

Established Pharmaceuticals (EPD): Abbott’s EPD business is likely to have continued its impressive streak of strong performance across several regions and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health, central nervous system and pain management. In addition, the company recently identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for EPD. Biosimilars currently represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market. Abbott achieved several milestones in recent times, advancing its portfolio of biosimilars, which are expected to have positively contributed to the company’s second-quarter top line.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s second-quarter revenues indicates a year-over-year increase of 6.1%.

Medical Devices: The segment has been a standout performer for the company, steadily growing over the past several quarters and making a notable impact on the margin performance. In the second quarter of 2025, the business sales are likely to have gained from the Diabetes Care division. This is expected to have been driven by the increasing adoption of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) systems, whose sales surged 20% in the previous quarter.

The electrophysiology portfolio is likely to have delivered robust performance across key regions and product categories. Within Structural Heart, we expect the company to report robust performance, led by the market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products.

Within the Rhythm Management arm, Abbott’s new leadless pacemaker, AVEIR, and the company’s newest implantable cardiac monitor, Assert, are making strides. In April, ABT released favorable clinical study data for its AVEIR and Volt PFA system. In Heart Failure, growth is expected to have been driven by its market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offers treatment for chronic and temporary conditions.

Meanwhile, Vascular arm’s growth can be attributed to Esprit, the company’s below-the-knee resorbable stent. Furthermore, the growth in the Neuromodulation division might have been led by the launch of next-generation delivery system, which will be used to streamline the implantation process for electrodes used as part of its Proclaim dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurostimulation system. All these developments are anticipated to have boosted Abbott’s top line in the quarter under review.

According to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Medical device segment’s second-quarter revenues are expected to improve 10.9% year over year.

Nutrition: In this division, the robust sales of adult nutrition brand Ensure are likely to have contributed to its second-quarter top-line performance. We also expect solid quarterly growth across the U.S. portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a 4.3% year-over-year improvement in the segment’s second-quarter revenues.

What Our Model Suggests

Per our proven model, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, have a higher chance of beating estimates. This is exactly the case here, as you can see below:

Other Stocks Worth a Look

Here are some other medical stocks worth considering, as these, too, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this reporting cycle.

CVS Health CVS has an Earnings ESP of +2.06% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is slated to release second-quarter 2025 results on July 31. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.

CVS’ earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 18.08%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter EPS implies a year-over-year decline of 19.7%.

Cencora COR has an Earnings ESP of +1.49% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Aug. 6.

The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 6.00%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter EPS implies a year-over-year increase of 13.2%.

Cardinal Health CAH has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #2 at present. The company is expected to release fiscal fourth-quarter results soon.

CAH’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 10.30%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter EPS suggests a year-over-year improvement of 1.3%.

Supply of labour expands at steepest rate since November 2020.

Permanent placements drop at fastest pace in 22 months.

Pay growth weakens for perm and temp staff.

Data collected 12-24 June

Summary

Uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June, according to the latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global. Permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Steeper reduction in recruitment activity in June

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

Permanent Placements Index

Temporary Billings

50.0 = no-change

Candidate supply expands at fastest pace since late 2020

The overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Steeper decline in overall vacancies signalled

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Slower growth in starting salaries and temp wages

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

Regional and Sector Variations

Permanent placements fell markedly across all four monitored English regions in June, with the steepest decline seen in the South of England.

Apart from a fractional rise in the Midlands, the decline in temp billings was broad-based and led by the South of England.

Retail saw by far the steepest reduction in demand for permanent staff across the eight job categories that posted a decline. The only sectors to record an increase in permanent vacancies were Construction and Engineering, though upturns were only mild overall.

Six of the ten broad job sectors monitored by the survey registered lower demand for temporary workers in June. The sharpest drops were signalled for Retail and Secretarial/Clerical roles. Construction recorded the strongest growth, experiencing a renewed and solid increase in vacancies.

Comments

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring. But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering - which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery. The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”

Methodology

The KPMG and REC, UK Report on Jobs is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Survey responses are collected in the second half of each month and indicate the direction of change compared to the previous month. A diffusion index is calculated for each survey variable. The index is the sum of the percentage of ‘higher’ responses and half the percentage of ‘unchanged’ responses. The indices vary between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month, and below 50 an overall decrease. The indices are then seasonally adjusted.

Underlying survey data are not revised after publication, but seasonal adjustment factors may be revised from time to time as appropriate which will affect the seasonally adjusted data series.

For further information on the survey methodology, please contact economics@spglobal.com.

The company’s research found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster.
This seeks to reduce the bottlenecks that can occur at self-checkout lanes and makes them easier for store employees to monitor.
The introduction of Express Self-Checkout has improved checkout times at both self-checkout and staffed lanes by 8%, the company said.
Other retailers that have recently set new limits on self-checkout items include discounter Five Below and grocery retailer Schnucks.","Why it matters:

Nearly four in five consumers (79.3%) use self-checkout regularly, according to a recent CapitalOne Shopping Research report.

Consumers appreciate the speed of self-checkout, according to NCR Voyix, which found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster.

As a result, retailers continue to invest in new self-checkout solutions such in-app checkouts, product-scanning smart carts, and item count limits to enhance the operational efficiency, meet the demands of their customers, and minimize theft.

Retailers are evolving their self-checkout strategies, in many cases leveraging advanced scanning technology and artificial intelligence. They are seeking to derive efficiencies and increase customer satisfaction through these labor-saving solutions while also addressing concerns about retail theft.

Consumers—especially young shoppers—have come to expect self-checkout at retail stores, and many consider it faster and more convenient than attended checkout. A recent CapitalOne Shopping Research report noted that 73% of shoppers prefer self-checkout, and 79.3% use self-checkout regularly. The report also projected that the market for self-checkout technology in North America will more than double during the next five years, reaching $5.43 billion in 2030, up from an estimated $2.63 billion in 2025.

Speed of checkout is one of consumers’ primary reasons for choosing self-checkout, according to a recent report from technology solutions provider NCR Voyix. The company’s research found that 70% of shoppers surveyed said they chose self-checkout over staffed lanes because it was faster. Nearly half (46%) said they prefer self-checkout because they like to bag their own items, and 36% said they opt to do it themselves because the lines are shorter.

Meanwhile, theft continues to be a concern for retailers offering self-checkout. A Lending Tree survey of 2,000 consumers found that 15% of self-checkout users have purposely stolen an item and that 44% of those who have stolen items planned to do so again.

In fact, a few large retailers have removed self-checkout from some of their stores, including Walmart, which eliminated self-checkout machines in a handful of locations last year. While those moves generated some headlines, the retail industry appears determined to make self-checkout work with a variety of strategies that seek to minimize theft, optimize efficiency, and cater to their shoppers’ preferences.

Following are some of that ways that retailers are seeking to turn self-checkout in a win-win for both businesses and consumers.

Retailers such as Target enforce a limit on number of items to speed checkout

Some retailers have made efforts to move their customers through checkout faster by enforcing a limit on the number of items consumers can purchase in self-checkout lanes. This seeks to reduce the bottlenecks that can occur at self-checkout lanes and makes them easier for store employees to monitor.

For example, last year, Target launched a 10-item limit in self-checkout lanes and renamed the service “Express Self-Checkout.” The efforts, combined with a new employee training initiative, have yielded positive results, the company said in a recent blog post.

The introduction of Express Self-Checkout has improved checkout times at both self-checkout and staffed lanes by 8%, the company said. Customers have also reported better checkout experiences overall, whichever option they choose. Target’s Net Promoter Score (NPS, a measure of customer experience) for checkout has improved by five points for wait times and by three points for interaction with employees.

“Express Self-Checkout has been a great success … with both our guests and team members seeing the benefits,” the retailer said.

Other retailers that have recently set new limits on self-checkout items include discounter Five Below and grocery retailer Schnucks.

The mobile-app solution: Putting self-checkout in the palm of customers’ hands

Another variation of self-checkout puts the entire checkout process—or most of it in many cases—in the palm of customers’ hands.

Mobile app–based checkout, which has been available in various forms for several years, gained some traction during the pandemic, with mixed results. More recently, app-based checkout has gained more attention with the announcement that Sam’s Club, the Walmart-owned warehouse-club retailer, is rolling out its latest Scan & Go checkout system at all of its 600-plus locations in the United States.

The system leverages the retailer’s Scan & Go mobile app, which shoppers use to scan items as they shop and pay for their purchases automatically, without the use of a self-checkout lane at all. The app has been available to members of the warehouse club since 2016, but Sam’s Club said it is now using AI-powered scanning technology to verify the content of shopping carts, which eliminates the need for employees to visually compare shoppers’ paper receipts to the content in their carts.

Sam’s Club’s two major rivals, Costco and BJ’s, have self-checkout apps of their own that they’ve been promoting to their customers. In addition to eliminating the need to wait in lines at checkout, the apps also off other features, such as product location and access to coupons and promotions.

In Costco’s recent fiscal third-quarter conference call with investors, CEO Ron Vachris said the company has been testing digital technologies to improve the speed of checkout.

“We’ve engaged in some ‘Scan & Go done by Costco’ kind of tests that have been extremely successful moving people through the lines and expediting the transactions,” he said.

Some “very, very early” results have been positive, and member adoption has also been encouraging, he said.

Amazon’s ‘Just Walk Out’ tech still has legs; in test mode at WHSmith North America

High-tech checkout solutions that use cameras and other monitors to record shoppers’ purchases are also expanding, despite some early challenges. Amazon’s aptly named Just Walk Out technology, for example, has proven to be successful at small retail stores where customers are pressed for time, such as in airports and sports venues and at student halls on college campuses, according to the company.

With the Just Walk Out platform, customers generally scan a credit card when they enter the store, and a system of sensors and cameras monitors which items they select and leave the store with. Amazon last year said it had plans to double the number of third-party stores using Just Walk Out. Among the retailers testing the technology is WHSmith North America, which operates retail stores in airports. It debuted Just Walk Out at a location in New York’s LaGuardia Airport in 2022.

The technology appears to be gaining traction in small stores where customers are buying a limited number of items—like a bottle of water or a box of popcorn—but it has yet to prove itself in bigger, more complicated shopping trips such as a weekly grocery shop at a full-scale grocery store.

Smart carts, ‘self-checkout on wheels,’ are on a roll

Sometimes described as “self-checkout on wheels,” so-called smart carts use a combination of sensors, built-in scales, and cameras to automatically scan items as customers shop. They also incorporate interactive touch screens and features that enable digital payments in order to smooth the checkout process.

Instacart, the third-party grocery delivery specialist, has rolled out a smart cart called Caper Cart that allows brands and retailers to promote products to customers as they shop, among other features. Customers can also see a running tally of their purchases, sync with their digital shopping list, and search for products’ locations in the store. The carts have been tested or rolled out at several grocery chains, including Schnucks and Save Mart.

Amazon, meanwhile, as its own version of smart carts called Dash Carts, which it has deployed in its 65 Amazon Fresh grocery stores in lieu of Just Walk Out technology. The company is also testing the technology in a handful of its Whole Foods Market locations. When customers are done shopping, they simply push their carts through special, sensor-equipped Dash Cart lanes, and then bag their own groceries.

A tentative agreement had been reached July 2, subject to approval by union members.
Workers at Stater Bros., Gelson’s, Super A and El Super stores in Southern California are negotiating similar terms with their employers, according to the UFCW.","LOS ANGELES – The United Food and Commercial Workers announced Friday night that its approximately 45,000 members at Albertsons, Pavilions, Ralphs and Vons stores from San Luis Obispo to the U.S.-Mexico border voted to approve a new three-year contract.

A spokeswoman for Albertsons Saturday called the recently approved contract covering unionized workers at four Southern California supermarket chains “fair and equitable.”

“We are pleased to have reached a fair and equitable agreement with the UFCW,” said Courtney Carranza, director of communications and public affairs of the Southern California Division of Albertsons. Albertsons is also the parent company of Pavilions and Vons.

“We appreciate the union’s partnership in reaching a contract that will benefit our associates and allow us to continue to serve our customers in Southern California.”

Key provisions of the agreement include substantial wage increases, a new supplemental pension plan to help workers in their retirement, increased health care benefit contributions, faster health care eligibility for new hires and staffing language that includes the union “in evaluating reasonable staffing levels that address efficient operation of the stores, the health and safety of employees, and the quality of customer service,” according to the union.

The six UFCW locals released a statement saying “the journey to contract ratification saw a record turnout of grocery workers, customers, and community members, all fighting for the same thing — better stores, better lives, better communities. They fought to ensure that grocery workers could feed their own families and afford health benefits and a dignified retirement at the end of a long career. They also fought for more staffing to improve the customer experience at their stores.

“Their fight took to the streets where they organized numerous rallies and marches that showed their power. It took to their stores where they stood up and demonstrated their unity by signing petitions and wearing buttons. Grocery workers also joined with customers in the fight for better staffing, talking to over 3,000 customers about their shopping experiences and sharing their feedback with these companies that can afford to do better.

“These actions built the strength needed to reach this agreement. Only by rising up together were grocery workers able to make a change in their workplaces that will benefit all grocery workers and customers in the future.”

The contracts will go into effect immediately.

Workers’ separate contracts with Ralphs and Albertsons expired on March 2.

The union announced June 11 that its members had voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike. Although a walkout had not been called by the union, workers held a series of “practice strike” demonstrations.

A tentative agreement had been reached July 2, subject to approval by union members.

There was no immediate response to an email sent late Friday night to a spokesman for Ralphs seeking comment.

For loyal customers and longtime employees, the announcement feels less like a corporate manoeuvre and more like the end of a relationship. Kroger, one of America’s most recognised supermarket names, is preparing to close 60 stores across the country—a surgical cut to its vast empire of over 2,700 outlets.

But this is more than a routine consolidation. It is, in many ways, the visible scar left by an invisible war—a failed merger, regulatory pressure, shifting consumer patterns, and the changing geography of American retail.

Texas First, but Not Alone

The first confirmed farewell comes from McKinney, Texas, at 1707 W. University Drive—30 miles from Dallas, where generations of families picked up their weekly groceries, prescriptions, and household staples. Over the next 18 months, more doors will shut in Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Indiana, Louisiana, and Virginia.

These closures are not abrupt—there will be no sudden extinguishing of lights. Kroger is planning a slow retreat, giving communities time to adjust, employees time to transfer, and competitors time to circle.

The Collapse of a Supermarket Superpower Dream

Just months ago, Kroger was preparing for a different kind of announcement: a historic merger with Albertsons that promised to rewrite the rules of grocery retail in the United States. Together, the two giants would have rivalled Walmart’s dominance and defied Amazon’s digital siege on the physical store.

But regulators thought otherwise. The FTC, under increasing political and public scrutiny, blocked the deal. They feared monopoly, price hikes, and a vanishing middle ground for consumers. In rejecting the merger, the government sent a clear message: big isn’t always better.

Now, without its Albertsons alliance, Kroger must navigate alone. And the map has changed.

Why the Closures Matter

On paper, 60 stores out of 2,731 sounds negligible—just over 2%. But to the communities they serve, they are the cornerstones of daily life. A supermarket is never just a place to buy food. It is a place of routine, familiarity, sometimes even sanctuary.

For employees, many of whom have worked in these stores for years or decades, the closures are personal. The company insists relocation options are on the table—but not everyone will find their way back into the fold.

And for shoppers? It’s not just about convenience. It’s about trust. Trust built on weekly visits, knowing where every item sits, and being greeted by name. When a supermarket vanishes, it creates a hole in the neighbourhood that no press release can fill.

An Industry at a Crossroads

Kroger’s retreat marks a moment of reckoning. The American grocery landscape is being reshaped not just by economics, but by emotion, ethics, and evolving expectations.

Consumers want value—but also connection. They demand technology—but not at the expense of human touch. They are shopping with their values, their wallets, and increasingly, their feet.

Kroger’s closures are a lesson for all large retailers: scale is not security. Survival now hinges on precision, empathy, and adaptability.

What’s Next for the Retail Giant?

Kroger has not said this explicitly, but the closure of underperforming stores is an act of self-preservation. Without the Albertsons merger to carry it into the future, it must now streamline, refocus, and perhaps even reinvent.

Whether this is the beginning of a leaner, smarter Kroger or the slow fade of a once-unquestioned titan remains to be seen. What’s certain is this: in every zip code where the lights go out, Kroger leaves behind more than a vacant building—it leaves behind memories, habits, and a space waiting to be filled.

And in American retail, empty spaces never stay empty for long.",https://internationalsupermarketnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-download-4-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 11:08:51.166187

Nike is said to be focusing on different sports categories across its various brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse.

The brand has been grappling with slower sales growth and increasing competition within the global market recently.

In its fourth-quarter revenues of fiscal 2025, Converse recorded a 26% decrease in sales, amounting to $357m on both reported and currency-neutral bases. The brand also saw a 19% drop in annual revenue to $1.7bn, with an 18% decline on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues at Nike fell 10% to $46.31bn in FY25.

These challenges have led to cost-cutting initiatives and a strategic shift towards performance-oriented sports products.

Carver's tenure at Converse spanned 15 years and included key leadership positions in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Cain, who has been with Nike for over two decades and currently serves as vice president and general manager of Nike Global Men's, is set to assume his new responsibilities after a transition period concluding at the end of July.

Cain's appointment follows a broader series of executive reshuffles at Nike.

In May this year, the company promoted Amy Montagne, Global Women’s VP/GM to president at Nike.

Phil McCartney, formerly VP of Footwear advanced to EVP, chief innovation, design and product officer.

Chief marketing officer Nicole Graham was also promoted to EVP, chief marketing officer to lead Nike, Jordan and Converse.

Tom Clarke, the strategic advisor to the CEO, transitioned into the role of chief growth initiatives officer.

Wegmans announced the launch of Caper Carts, Instacart’s AI-powered smart carts, at its Dewitt location in Syracuse, New York, earlier this month.

“This marks the first deployment of Caper Carts at Wegmans,” the press release said.

The innovation — part of the Instacart’s technology Connected Stores — allows customers to track their spending while shopping. The carts will automatically recognize items as they are put into them, and customers can bag as they shop.

The tech — including cameras, a digital scale and location sensors — also allows for a seamless checkout, enabling payment for items directly from a cart and eliminating having to wait in a checkout line.

The tool that tracks spending as you shop could make a huge difference for shoppers on a budget, as they won’t have to anxiously await the total cost at checkout.

To use the wheeled tool, Wegmans shoppers can log in to their Shoppers Club account via a screen on the cart.

“Caper Carts are transforming everyday grocery shopping into a faster, more personalized experience,” the Chief Connected Stores Officer at Instacart, David McIntosh, said in a statement.

While Instacart’s Caper Carts are only being tested at the Syracuse location, a representative for Wegmans told Food & Wine that they are “doing smart cart test-and-learn pilots in four stores — Perinton and Pittsford in Rochester, Alberta Drive in Buffalo, and at our Dewitt store in Syracuse — with two different technology providers,” adding that they “are limiting the program to these stores as we gather customer feedback to drive improvements.”

Whether the technology will expand to more Wegmans stores is dependent on how smoothly the grocery shopping process goes at the test stores.

Kraft Heinz Co is considering spinning off a large portion of its grocery business into a separate company that could be valued at up to $20 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The proposed separation would carve out several Kraft-branded products - primarily packaged meals, processed meats, and slower-moving grocery staples - into a new entity. The existing company would retain higher-growth categories such as condiments and sauces, including Heinz ketchup and Grey Poupon mustard.

Kraft Heinz said in May that it was reviewing strategic options to unlock shareholder value but has not confirmed any specifics regarding a spinoff.

Spinoff mirrors industry pivot as processed food demand slows

The planned breakup marks a major shift for a company once seen as a symbol of efficiency and global scale after the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz, orchestrated by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. Since then, the firm has faced headwinds from changing consumer preferences, inflation, and growing competition from private labels.

Kraft Heinz has also faced setbacks in selling underperforming brands like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House, and in 2019, it wrote down $15 billion in value from its Kraft and Oscar Mayer businesses. The company has promised to remove artificial colours from U.S. products, following increased scrutiny of food additives.

Shares of Kraft Heinz rose 2% on Friday following the Journal's report. The stock has lost over 60% of its value since the merger, erasing nearly $57 billion in market capitalisation.

The potential split reflects a broader trend in the packaged food industry. Kellogg Co separated its business into Kellanova and WK Kellogg last year, and this week, WK Kellogg agreed to a $3 billion sale to Italy's Ferrero Group.

While discussions are ongoing and final terms may change, the spinoff would result in two independently operated companies with focused portfolios. Berkshire Hathaway remains Kraft Heinz’s largest shareholder but has stepped back from board involvement, while 3G Capital exited the company in 2023.

The move underscores how legacy food giants are adapting to a market that increasingly favours fresher products, streamlined operations, and sharper brand focus.

It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.","July 14 (Reuters) – Talks with the South African government have so far yielded little progress to avert the closure of loss-making long steel operations at ArcelorMittal South Africa, the company said on Monday.

The South African unit of world number two steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA initially said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

“Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,” ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a trading update. It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

South Africa’s trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 that the government was in “firefighting mode” as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal’s operations in KwaZulu Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors as well as components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and the government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service “deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk,” the steelmaker’s statement said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa expects to report a headline loss per share between 0.89 rand and 0.99 rand ($0.0498-$0.0554) for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from 1 rand per share during the same period last year.

Sales volumes declined by about 10% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, the company said.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017.
Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.","A “strategic transaction” proposition put forward by Kraft Heinz in May could well be about to emerge with a business split a tad over the ten-year anniversary of the mega-merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz.

Such a development would surely not be much of a surprise to market watchers following a slew of poor results from Kraft Heinz and perhaps a veiled submission of what might be considered as the failed combination of 2015 – the company’s shares are currently trading at $27.14 in New York compared to circa $88 when that deal was completed on 2 July of that year.

Berkshire Hathaway, the US investment group led by Warren Buffett, is reportedly weighing up the disposal of its estimated 27% share in the Heinz ketchup maker, while private-equity firm 3G Capital, which joined the billionaire in the 2015 business combination, is long gone having sold its shares in 2023.

Kraft Heinz pledged in May to “unlock shareholder value” as the company assessed strategic options for a business that generated revenue of $26bn last year. CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera, in the job for only 18 months, may well have been encouraged by the split initiated by Kellogg Company in 2023.

Confectionery giant Ferrero announced a $3.1bn deal for WK Kellogg last week, the North American breakfast cereals business that emerged from that separation. The other portion, Kellanova, is in the throes of a $35.9bn takeover by another sweets heavyweight, Mars.

A valuation of $20bn has been attached to a potential spin-off by Kraft Heinz, according to unnamed sources at The Wall Street Journal, which reported on Friday (11 July) a demerger may feature a ‘large chunk of its grocery business’. Sauces, condiments and spreads such as its namesake ketchup brand and the Grey Poupon Dijon mustard line would remain as Kraft Heinz.

Industry analysts were quick off the blocks to comment on the speculation, no doubt galvanised by the speed in which the Ferrero-WK Kellogg deal came to fruition last week, from speculation through to fact the same day.

The WSJ report, meanwhile, came days after Kraft Heinz announced the sale of a handful of brands in Italy to the recently created NewPrinces for €120m ($140.2m).

“Non–sensical”

Investment bank Stifel, in a report led by Matthew Smith, threw some perspective on what might emerge.

“We believe the potential spin of a part of the grocery business would include the company’s slower growth and highly competitive/commoditised categories, with the remaining entity keeping Kraft’s priority platforms including sauces/condiments and snacking/easy meals.

Smith said the Stifel analysts believe the faster-growing assets to remain would include Kraft Heinz’s North America retail “accelerate” platforms, the company’s global away-from-home unit and its emerging markets businesses. The assets spun off could house the retail portions of the company’s “protect” and “balance” platforms.

Stifel’s analysts quantified the accelerate platforms as including condiments, ready-meals brands Mac & Cheese and Ore-Ida, plus snacking lines such as Lunchables and Delimex.

The assets that could be spun off would include Oscar Mayer meats, Jell-O desserts, drinks brands Capri-Sun and Kool-Aid, cheese with Kraft and Velveeta, plus coffee, as in Maxwell House and Gevalia.

Meanwhile, Peter McDonald, a food-industry consultant and former General Mills executive of 20-plus years, weighed in on the failed merger angle of 2015 in what he described as one of the “darkest chapters in CPG food during my career”.

McDonald explained his thoughts in a LinkedIn post: “The new entity pursued a new-to-the-industry aggressive margin expansion playbook that sent competitors chasing ‘zero-based budgeting’ and other nonsensical corporate initiatives in a desperate attempt to avoid being gobbled up themselves.

“Investors lapped it up and Kraft Heinz hit a maximum enterprise value of $140bn in 2017. Since then, food-industry reality has reasserted itself and the margin extraction from innovation, marketing, talent, and pricing aggression has taken its toll,” he wrote, putting Kraft Heinz’s current enterprise value at $50bn.

And acknowledging the reports of a spin-off are only based on speculation at this point, he added: “Now the company may be broken up into constituent parts not unlike things were when the whole fiasco started”.

Sales pressure

Kraft Heinz’s 2024 reported sales dropped 3% to $25.85bn, with organic growth down 2.1% in what CEO Abrams-Rivera described as “a challenging year with our top-line results coming in below our expectations”.

Net income fell to $2.74bn, from the $2.86bn booked for 2023. The company also reported a 63.2% slump in full-year operating profit to $1.7bn, which was linked to $3.7bn in non-cash impairment losses.

It was a poor performance echoed in the opening quarter of 2025, too. Net sales dropped 6.4% on a reported basis and declined 4.7% in organic terms to just shy of $7bn. In the three months to 29 March, operating income decreased 8.1% to $1.2bn.

Net income stood at $712m versus $801m a year earlier.

Alongside the first-quarter numbers, Kraft Heinz also cut its 2025 outlook across a range of metrics to factor in the potential upward pressure on input-cost inflation from changes in tariffs.

Kellogg demerger

“There can be no assurance that the company’s assessment process will result in any transaction, or any assurance as to its outcome or timing,” Kraft Heinz said in a statement in May as it revealed the strategic transaction proposition.

“The company has not set a timetable for completion of this process and does not intend to make any further announcements regarding the process unless and until it determines that further disclosure is appropriate or necessary.”

Picking up on the WSJ report, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow estimated the likely valuation of the part of the Kraft Heinz grocery business spin-off at $14.5bn, short of the $20bn put forward by the publication.

He, too, linked his observations to the Kellogg demerger. “Bankers and board members of the food industry certainly have noticed the value capture of the 2023 Kellogg split up. After accounting for the Mars and Ferrero acquisitions of the two parts, investors will have realised 41% since the spin, while consumer staples stocks (by our math) fell 6% and fundamentals deteriorated due to changes in consumer preferences and external factors like GLP-1s,” Moskow wrote in a research note.

The TD Cowen analyst also speculated a buyer might step in – whether that’s Kraft Heinz’s intention or not – to snap up the offload, naming McCormick as a potential suitor.

“Our sum-of-the-parts analysis indicates 11% upside to KHC’s current enterprise value based on eight times EV/EBITDA for grocery and 10.5x EV/EBITDA for sauces, condiments and spreads,” Moskow suggested.

“However, we could see another 20% upside if a strategic acquirer steps up to buy the sauces and condiments business (about 44% of KHC sales), which will look a lot like the original pre-merger Heinz business of 2013. For example, we see a good strategic fit with McCormick, which has been expanding into the condiments space for several years through tack-on deals, and a high degree of EPS accretion.”

Moskow added to his thesis by explaining that “mega-mergers in food have low success rates and that ‘depth’ tends to beat ‘breadth’”.

He continued: “The skill set and investment requirements to succeed in disparate parts of the grocery store (e.g. refrigerated, frozen, shelf-stable, and snacks) tend to differ.

“We believe that food companies with focused portfolios and category leadership (e.g. Hershey) have a better chance of long-term success than diversified companies trying to leverage operating and marketing capabilities across a wide range of categories.”

Back to 2015

A common theme emanating from food-industry analysts is the throw back to the pre-2015 merger, what AllianceBernstein’s Alexia Howard deemed as a “reversal”.

“When we looked into the relative growth rates of the legacy Heinz company since the companies were merged in 2015, it looks as though the legacy Heinz business has grown retail sales at a 5.3% CAGR over the past decade, while the legacy Kraft brands have grown at only 2%,” Howard wrote in a research note.

“Looking at how the company could break up might mean that the remaining faster-growing company comprises the 25% of companywide sales in international markets plus another 30% of the 75% of the US sales for a total of around 47.5% of companywide sales.”

Howard explained further: “Looking at how the sales could break down, it seems that the faster-growing remaining company could represent around 47.5% of company-wide sales. Clearly, the margins in the international markets are significantly lower than in North America, which could mean that 38.2% of the total company’s adjusted EBITDA of $6.36bn in 2024 potentially sits with the faster-growing remaining company, while the remaining 61.8% sits with the spin-off.”

The Stifel analysts added: “The hypothetical slower growth ‘Spin Co’ would incorporate the retail protect platform featuring a projected low-single digit, ten-year, industry CAGR, high gross margins and low private-label penetration, as well as the retail balance commoditised business platform featuring a flat projected ten-year industry CAGR, low gross margins, and high private-label penetration.

“We view a potential spin of the lower growth and lower-margin retail businesses as a way to unlock value within the higher growth and higher-margin remaining businesses.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/06/shutterstock_2501948921-heinz-edited.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:05:32.391146

Developed by the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium, the project brings together ENGIE (35%), Orascom Construction PLC (25%), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (20%), and Eurus Energy Holdings (20%).
Since 2015, the country’s renewable output has increased by over 340%, with wind energy playing an increasingly central role.
François Xavier Boul, ENGIE’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasised the project’s economic and environmental value: “This renewable energy is cheaper than burning gas.
Looking ahead, the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium is already planning a follow-up project expected to exceed 900 MW, further consolidating Egypt’s role as a renewable energy leader on the African continent.","ENGIE has successfully commissioned the 650-megawatt Red Sea Wind Energy project, making it the largest operational wind farm in both the Middle East and Africa. Located on Egypt’s Red Sea coast near Ras Ghareb, the onshore wind complex is now fully operational and delivering clean power to more than one million homes.

The project was delivered in phases, with the first 306 MW coming online in December 2024, followed by an additional 194 MW in April 2025. The final 150 MW segment was completed in June, bringing the project to full capacity four months ahead of schedule. This early completion highlights both the efficiency of the project team and the strength of collaboration between international and regional partners.

Developed by the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium, the project brings together ENGIE (35%), Orascom Construction PLC (25%), Toyota Tsusho Corporation (20%), and Eurus Energy Holdings (20%). Together, these partners have built a landmark facility that will cut around 1.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, while helping Egypt meet its ambitious renewable energy targets.

Safety was a top priority throughout construction. The team completed over seven million man-hours without a single lost-time incident, reflecting a strong safety culture and project discipline. This is particularly notable for a development of this scale and complexity.

The wind farm operates under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC), ensuring long-term economic and grid stability. The project’s financing was secured through a consortium of international institutions including Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Norinchukin, Société Générale, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), with additional support from NEXI.

This milestone boosts ENGIE’s renewable footprint in Egypt to nearly 1 gigawatt, reinforcing its strategic position in the region. Egypt, meanwhile, is making major strides in expanding its renewable capacity—aiming for 42% of its electricity mix to come from renewable sources by 2030. Since 2015, the country’s renewable output has increased by over 340%, with wind energy playing an increasingly central role.

François Xavier Boul, ENGIE’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, emphasised the project’s economic and environmental value: “This renewable energy is cheaper than burning gas. It clearly allows for burning less gas and for the country to either import less or export more.”

ENGIE’s broader ambition is to expand rapidly across the MENA region, where faster permitting and shorter development timelines offer an edge over markets in Europe and North America. The company is targeting 95 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030, up from about 51 GW today.

Looking ahead, the Red Sea Wind Energy consortium is already planning a follow-up project expected to exceed 900 MW, further consolidating Egypt’s role as a renewable energy leader on the African continent. With this flagship development, Egypt not only strengthens its energy independence but also sets a replicable model for other nations in the region aiming to accelerate their energy transition.",https://www.energyconnects.com/media/hqahcvem/wind-energy-desert.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=132741752282930000,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:14.403716

Consumer spending continues to benefit from a resilient labor market, though momentum has begun to moderate. The resumption of student loan payments in the U.S. has added financial pressure on households, compounding concerns over rising tariffs. Earlier this year, anticipation of new tariffs prompted a pull-forward in spending, particularly on big-ticket items like motor vehicles. All the heightened discussion around tariffs has not only impacted business strategies but also weighed on consumer sentiment. The constant media coverage and policy uncertainty have made consumers increasingly anxious about potential price hikes and economic instability, further dampening their willingness to spend. Moreover, it has led many retailers to revise their earnings outlook downward for the remainder of the year.

Accordingly, the Q1 2025 LSEG Retail/Restaurant Index 7.5% earnings growth rate is expected to decline to -1.7% in Q2 2025, its first negative showing since the pandemic, underscoring a slowdown in consumer spending (Exhibit 2). The index is also estimated to remain in the low single digits for the second half of the year. Similarly, the blended revenue growth estimate for the 197 companies in this index is 2.0% for Q2 2025 (Exhibit 2). This is also the weakest showing since the pandemic and is also expected to remain below 3.0% for the second half of the year. Looking ahead, retailers are bracing for a challenging and volatile environment. They report that consumers are increasingly value-conscious, navigating a landscape shaped by persistent inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions, regulatory uncertainty, and tariff-related disruptions.

A closer look at the data reveals that this year’s slowdown is concentrated around three main consumer sectors. The Leisure Products sector is expected to post the weakest Q2 2025 performance, with profits projected to decline by 44.7% (Exhibit 3). The Textiles, Apparel & Luxury Goods sector follows, with a -44.4% growth estimate that reflects underlying softness in earnings momentum. Both sectors are also forecast to deliver the weakest earnings growth in the second half of the year. Additionally, the Household Durables sector is on track to report negative earnings growth for 2025, further highlighting the pressure facing consumer discretionary categories.

This is in line with the LSEG/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index, which finds that overall American consumer sentiment has declined for three consecutive months. The latest drop in consumer sentiment is driven by a sharp decline in purchasing comfort and the continued decline in current views of the job market. Previously, much of the unease shown by consumers was rooted in fears about the future of the economy. However, consumers are now more pessimistic about their current situation. American consumer confidence continues to demonstrate the broader economic uncertainty the public feels today.

Despite broader sector challenges, there are pockets of optimism. Looking ahead to Q2 earnings, analysts surveyed by LSEG are already bullish on MGM Resorts International. The consensus estimate for MGM’s Q2 2025 EPS stands at $0.52. Notably, a highly rated five-star analyst with a very accurate rating has issued a Bold Estimate of $0.83, significantly above the consensus. This divergence suggests a potential earnings beat and the possibility of a positive surprise when MGM reports.

The StarMine SmartEstimate is a weighted average of analyst estimates, with more weight given to more recent estimates and more accurate analysts. Our studies have shown that when the SmartEstimate differs from the consensus (I/B/E/S mean) by more than 2%, the company is likely to post subsequent earnings surprises directionally correct 70% of the time. This percentage difference is referred to as the Predicted Surprise (PS%) (Exhibit 4).

Similarly, the companies listed below have a Predicted Surprise exceeding 2.0% for Q2 2025, Q3 2025, and the current fiscal year. This indicates a strong likelihood of outperforming earnings expectations and delivering positive surprises.

Conversely, the companies listed below have a negative Predicted Surprise of less than -2.0% for Q2 2025, Q3 2025, and the current fiscal year; indicating they are likely to miss earnings expectations and deliver negative surprises.

Pricing pressures

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.1% month-over-month from April to May 2025, and 2.4% year-over-year. Retailers continue to face headwinds from weak consumer sentiment and a value-conscious shopper grappling with elevated living expenses. The CPI data highlights that consumers are contending with higher costs for essentials such as food, electricity, medical care, and transportation compared to a year ago.

However, apparel prices have bucked the broader inflation trend, declining 0.4% month-over-month and 0.9% year-over-year. This trend is consistent with LSEG data, which shows widespread apparel price reductions. In collaboration with Centric Market Intelligence, we are tracking weekly average original prices across selected categories in U.S. mall stores. Since December 2024, average prices have been monitored weekly through June 2025. Among the categories tracked, Men’s Apparel has experienced the steepest decline, with prices falling 3.0%, followed by Women’s Apparel falling 2.2% (Exhibit 7).

Discount levels – U.S. online retailers

Despite declining apparel prices, retailers are offering fewer promotions. The discount penetration, defined as the percentage of merchandise on sale, has fallen below the historical range of 34% to 42% observed over the past decade (Exhibit 8). Year-to-date in 2025, the average discount penetration stands at just 26%, down from 34% last year and below pre-pandemic levels. This shift comes at a time when retailers are contending with increasingly value-conscious consumers, highlighting a strategic shift in promotional activity amid evolving demand dynamics.

However, the average percent discount has remained relatively stable at 35%, just below last year’s average of 36%.

Retail Same Store Sales

In the retail sector, approximately 42% of the companies in our SSS index are on track to deliver positive same-store sales (SSS) results for 2025. Aritzia led the pack with the strongest SSS performance in Q1 and is expected to maintain robust comps throughout the year. Similarly, Ralph Lauren and TJX are also projected to post consistently healthy same-store sales in 2025.

Meanwhile, Kohl’s is on track to report consistently negative comps in 2025. In fact, about 58% of the retailers in our SSS Index are on track to report consistently negative comps this year. Target reported a -3.8% comp in Q1 2025. While the following quarters’ estimates remain negative, the results reflect a sequential improvement in performance (Exhibit 11).

E-commerce sales

According to the latest e-commerce report from the U.S. Census Bureau, online sales reached $300 billion in Q1 2025, representing a 6.1% year-over-year increase. However, this marks a slowdown from the 7.6% growth observed over the past year (Exhibit 14). LSEG data suggests that total consumer spending online in 2025 is likely to remain below 2024 levels.

E-commerce currently accounts for just 16.2% of total U.S. retail sales, indicating that the majority of consumers still prefer shopping in brick-and-mortar stores. A significant portion of the retail market remains underpenetrated by major online players like Amazon.

Shifting consumer behavior

Retailers have just concluded reporting Q1 2025 earnings, with 88% referencing tariffs during their earnings calls, underscoring the growing influence of trade policy on the sector. New and expanded tariffs on imports from key trade partners, including China, are reshaping cost structures and altering supply chain dynamics. While large retailers such as Walmart have the scale, capital, and pricing power to absorb or strategically offset these pressures, smaller players remain significantly more vulnerable, with limited flexibility to manage rising costs and operational disruptions.

Despite elevated import costs, many retailers are choosing to absorb part of the burden rather than risk losing demand from increasingly price-sensitive consumers. Preserving market share has become a top priority, prompting companies to implement mitigation strategies such as diversifying supply chains, renegotiating supplier terms, and optimizing inventory management. Still, some are selectively raising prices or absorbing costs to remain competitive in a challenging environment.

The recent decline in consumer sentiment reflects a sharp drop in purchasing confidence, driven largely by rising prices, and a continued deterioration in perceptions of the labor market. While earlier concerns were centered on long-term economic uncertainty, consumers are now increasingly focused on immediate financial pressures.

Although gasoline prices have eased over the past four months, renewed tensions in the Middle East have reignited concerns about a potential rebound. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that, as a rule of thumb, every $10 increase in oil prices can add approximately 0.2 percentage points to the inflation rate. He also emphasized that the Fed is in no rush to cut interest rates, preferring to wait for more data to assess the broader economic impact of tariffs and inflationary pressures.

Amid rising costs for essentials such as food, housing, and energy, apparel stands out as one of the few categories experiencing outright price declines. This deflationary trend may signal a broader consumer pullback. According to LSEG Retail Index data, the apparel sector is on track to post the weakest earnings growth in 2025. Brands caught between rising production costs and softening demand are increasingly turning to discounting strategies, an approach that risks eroding both margins and brand equity.

Despite inflation across most sectors, falling apparel prices, driven by subdued demand, excess inventory, and retailers’ reluctance to pass on cost increases, highlight the strain on consumer spending. This underscores the delicate balance retailers must strike between maintaining competitiveness and protecting profitability in today’s volatile economic landscape.",https://lipperalpha.refinitiv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/RTXZZ44.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:06:06.278659

Consumers are leaning towards healthier food options, and the rising inflation is also squeezing in on consumer spending, which has led to a slowdown in sales for the food manufacturing company.

Despite Kraft Heinz’s attempts to cater to the current consumer trends of healthier food by launching a zero-salt-and-sugar ketchup, the food brand is struggling to stay afloat amid rising competition.

The FMCG giant has reported a mixed financial performance in its most recent results, with its revenue going down for two years consecutively and lowering its future outlook.

Kraft Heinz is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 30.","Kraft Heinz Co. (Nasdaq: KHC) is exploring the breakup of its business operations, considering spinning off grocery brands into a separate company worth as much as $20 billion, the Wall Street Journal said Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The plan would separate many traditional Kraft-branded products into a new public company. This would allow Kraft Heinz to focus on faster-growing segments like sauces and condiments, including its flagship Heinz ketchup, as the food giant seeks to reverse years of declining sales.

Shares rose 2.5% Friday, giving the company a market value of about $31 billion. However, the stock has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since the 2015 merger that created Kraft Heinz.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said. The structure could change, and there’s no guarantee the company will proceed with any deal, the people said.

The potential breakup follows struggles with shifting consumer preferences toward fresher, less processed foods and mounting cost pressures. Net sales dropped 6.4% in the first quarter of 2025, while full-year 2024 sales declined 3%.

The move would echo Kellogg Co.‘s 2023 decision to spin off its declining cereal business, which was later acquired by Italy’s Ferrero for $3.1 billion.

Kraft Heinz emerged from a 2015 merger orchestrated by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital, which joined Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. The merger aimed to cut costs and boost profits, but has proven disappointing for Berkshire, which recently gave up its board seats.

CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera has acknowledged being “acutely aware of the building pressures across food,” including inflation and consumer anxiety affecting demand for the company’s packaged products.

The company recently announced it would eliminate artificial food coloring from US products by 2027, responding to health officials’ concerns about synthetic dyes.

Any split could be announced soon, though details remain under discussion, the sources said. Kraft Heinz is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July 30.",https://thedeepdive.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kraft-Heinz-Explores-20B-Grocery-Business-Spinoff.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 10:05:41.034898

Instore, advertisers can expect targeted signage, sampling events and digital displays, all informed by member data.
It has also signed a deal with Yahoo DSP, allowing Yahoo’s customers to target Costco’s members across the the open web.
Through partnerships like this, Costco’s retail media network extends beyond physical stores to digital environments.
Brands can engage Costco members across instore displays, Costco.com and offsite digital channels, creating a seamless advertising experience.","Costco, the third largest retailer in the US with $250bn in global sales in 2024, is rapidly developing a retail media network built on its unique membership model and robust first-party data.

Costco is a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing members the best possible prices on quality brand-name merchandise. With more than 900 locations worldwide, it provides a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all at a bargain price.

With this captive and data rich audience, Costco has started to embrace what it can do with retail media, specifically instore as that is where the bulk of all its sales still take place.

Unlike many competitors, Costco’s approach to retail media is rooted in its core value proposition: enhancing member experience and loyalty, rather than simply maximising ad revenue. This network is still in its early stages – still beta testing in late 2024 – but is poised to become a formidable player in the retail media landscape, leveraging both instore and digital touchpoints.

Costco’s greatest asset is its 80 million US cardholders, all of whom must use their membership cards for purchases. This creates a closed-loop environment, enabling Costco to link every transaction to a specific household and build detailed shopper profiles. Advertisers can then target audiences such as “Frequent Shoppers”, “Tenured Shoppers” and “Category Shoppers” using behavioural and purchase data to deliver highly relevant campaigns.

Already, Costco is expanding both instore and offsite media capabilities. Instore, advertisers can expect targeted signage, sampling events and digital displays, all informed by member data. Offsite, Costco has begun running campaigns with CPG partners on third-party media channels, achieving two to three times the typical return on ad spend in early tests.

It has also signed a deal with Yahoo DSP, allowing Yahoo’s customers to target Costco’s members across the the open web. Through partnerships like this, Costco’s retail media network extends beyond physical stores to digital environments. Brands can engage Costco members across instore displays, Costco.com and offsite digital channels, creating a seamless advertising experience. The Yahoo partnership also enables integration with Yahoo ConnectID, allowing for future-proof identity solutions and advanced measurement infrastructure.

Advertisers receive robust analytics and closed-loop measurement across this whole omnichannel portfolio of retail media, tracking campaign performance and sales impact within Costco’s audience segments. This transparency is a major draw for brands seeking to connect media spend to actual purchase behaviour.

With its membership driven data – which gives a uniquely rich dataset for ad targeting – Costco has been a late arrival in retail media, however this ‘last to market’ approach is also an advantage. The company is focused on building out infrastructure and capabilities over a multi-year roadmap, prioritizing data foundations and merchandising collaboration. It has also watched and learned from its competitors and, despite not actively pitching to agencies, Costco sees strong inbound interest from suppliers and brands. However, its limited product range compared to mass retailers may constrain the number of advertisers, ensuring campaigns remain highly relevant to members.",https://internetretailing.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Costco-Mike-Mozart-15410820046_7323e12d40_k.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 12:19:58.596618

Brown",,,,,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/airbnb-gets-experiential,"of Airbnb, was in SoHo the other day, standing near the cash register at the Housing Works Bookstore.
The Experiences section of the Airbnb app was still in beta mode, and the New York selection was slim (“Make beats with a New York DJ”; “Catacombs by Candlelight”).
Between texts, Chesky continued his pitch for the Airbnb redesign.
Naturally, the discussion turned to how much the building might rent for on Airbnb.
It wasn’t a serious idea, but it also wasn’t a radical one—Airbnb once offered an overnight stay at the Louvre, and another at the Musée d’Orsay.","You are an entrepreneur who has achieved the impossible. You have disrupted an entire sector of the economy and practically invented a new one. Most startups fail, but you have built yours into a billion-dollar company—a genus so scarce that it’s called a unicorn. Your brand has become a transitive verb. What do you do now? Stop growing? Stop disrupting? Of course not. Winners don’t quit. They find new ways to win.

Brian Chesky, the co-founder and C.E.O. of Airbnb, was in SoHo the other day, standing near the cash register at the Housing Works Bookstore. In addition to being a forty-three-year-old multibillionaire, he is among the swolest of the swole C.E.O.s, with a swoop of dark curly hair and lats that make Jeff Bezos look like a featherweight. There was a steady rain, but Chesky walked outside in pleated slacks and a form-fitting T-shirt, risking his suède Celine sneakers. “Unlike a lot of tech companies, our business exists in the real world,” he said. “To launch something the right way, you need to get out into the community.”

He was starting what he called “the next chapter of the company, an evolution I’ve been thinking about for a long time.” (Wired: “Airbnb Is in Midlife Crisis Mode.”) Since 2007, travellers have been able to Airbnb a place to stay; now they can also Airbnb a Service (haircut, massage) or an Experience (cooking class, Jet Ski outing). Chesky was in SoHo to have an Experience.

He had just arrived from California, where he lives alone (when he’s not renting out his guest room on the app). Next, he was on his way to Paris, Berlin, Milan, Rome, Seoul, and Tokyo, sampling new wares along the way. The Experiences section of the Airbnb app was still in beta mode, and the New York selection was slim (“Make beats with a New York DJ”; “Catacombs by Candlelight”). Chesky was going on a walking tour of SoHo, focussed on architectural photography.

“I’m out in these streets in all kinds of weather,” the photographer Ethan Barber, who was leading the tour, said. “The only compromise I’ll be making today, because of the rain, is I’ll be shooting iPhone-only.” Walking backward, his glasses fogging, Barber headed to the first destination, a cast-iron building on the corner of Prince and Greene. He was used to leading groups, but this one was a private demo for Chesky. Chesky, however, travels with an entourage: press attachés, a couple of executives, and a guy named Chase, whose job is to fill Chesky’s social-media accounts with humanizing photos of the boss. A black S.U.V.—driver, plus private security—kept pace with the group.

Someone handed Chesky an umbrella; he waved it off, walked half a block, then changed his mind and took it. At the first stop, Barber pointed to the building—a French Renaissance landmark from 1883, now a Ralph Lauren store—and located his favorite spot to shoot from, marked by a wad of chewing gum ground into the sidewalk. Chesky stood next to the gum, finished tapping out a text, then held his iPhone in landscape mode and took a few snaps of the building while Chase took snaps of him.

“This could be cool,” Chase said, reviewing a moody black-and-white shot of Chesky. “Not for grid, but for Stories, maybe.”

Chesky went back to texting, and Barber moved along—to an Isabel Marant store on Broome and then to a former Isaac Mizrahi warehouse at 102 Wooster. Between texts, Chesky continued his pitch for the Airbnb redesign. “Most apps want you down here, in the phone,” he said, bending his neck down. “Our purpose”—head up, shoulders back—“is to get you out and about, making memories.”

The final stop was a walk-through of an artist’s foundation. Two women guiding the tour asked the guests to refrain from indoor photography. Everyone complied, except Chesky, who may or may not have heard the instruction. “I’m redoing my house, and I would be so into a wood floor like this,” he said, taking a video and sending it to his designer. “I want it to have that artist feel.”

Throughout the space, there were places for the artist to rest—a daybed, an East African headrest, a wooden platform holding two mattresses and a sculpture. Naturally, the discussion turned to how much the building might rent for on Airbnb. It wasn’t a serious idea, but it also wasn’t a radical one—Airbnb once offered an overnight stay at the Louvre, and another at the Musée d’Orsay. This building could be similarly enticing, the group mused, if not even more so. One of the curators said, with a tight smile, “Thanks, but it’s not available.” ♦

Supply of labour expands at steepest rate since November 2020

Permanent placements drop at fastest pace in 22 months

Pay growth weakens for perm and temp staff

Data collected 12-24 June

Summary

Uncertainty over the business outlook and budget constraints led companies to reduce their hiring activity again in June, according to the latest KPMG and REC UK Report on Jobs survey, compiled by S&P Global. Permanent staff appointments fell at the steepest rate for nearly two years, while the downturn in temp billings also gathered pace. At the same time, overall vacancies continued to fall, particularly for permanent positions.

Recruiters also signalled a rapid upturn in overall candidate availability, which increased at the sharpest pace since November 2020, amid reports of redundancies and reduced appetite for staff. Improved labour supply, tighter budgets and lower demand for workers dampened pay growth in June, with starting salaries and temp wages increasing only modestly overall.

The report is compiled by S&P Global from responses to questionnaires sent to a panel of around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies.

Steeper reduction in recruitment activity in June

The latest survey of recruitment consultancies signalled an accelerated decline in hiring activity across the UK at the end of the second quarter. Permanent staff appointments fell at a substantial pace that was the quickest in nearly two years, while temp billings decreased at the fastest rate since February. There were widespread reports that companies had pulled back on hiring due to reduced confidence around the outlook and worries over costs.

Candidate supply expands at fastest pace since late 2020

The overall availability of staff increased rapidly in June amid reports of redundancies and weaker demand for workers. While the supply of permanent labour expanded at a slightly faster rate than that seen for temporary candidates, in each case the rate of growth was the sharpest recorded since November 2020.

Steeper decline in overall vacancies signalled

Total demand for workers continued to decline during June, and at a quicker pace than in May. Underlying data indicated that this reflected a steeper reduction in permanent vacancies, as demand for short-term staff fell at the softest rate in ten months.

Slower growth in starting salaries and temp wages

Lower demand for workers, tighter client budgets and improvements in candidate supply dampened pay growth in June. Starting salaries and temp wages both increased modestly overall, with rates of inflation notably weaker than their historical trends.

Regional and Sector Variations

Permanent placements fell markedly across all four monitored English regions in June, with the steepest decline seen in the South of England.

Apart from a fractional rise in the Midlands, the decline in temp billings was broad-based and led by the South of England.

Retail saw by far the steepest reduction in demand for permanent staff across the eight job categories that posted a decline. The only sectors to record an increase in permanent vacancies were Construction and Engineering, though upturns were only mild overall.

Six of the ten broad job sectors monitored by the survey registered lower demand for temporary workers in June. The sharpest drops were signalled for Retail and Secretarial/Clerical roles. Construction recorded the strongest growth, experiencing a renewed and solid increase in vacancies.

Commenting on the latest survey results, Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said:

“Ongoing geopolitical turbulence and the threat of rising costs, alongside the promise of technology efficiencies, mean companies continue to wait and see with their hiring. But where there have been recent Government commitments, such as in housebuilding and infrastructure, we are seeing a small increase in permanent vacancies in related sectors – construction and engineering - which is encouraging.

“As we head into the second half of the year, global headwinds will continue to impact the overall economic outlook, but clear priorities set out in the Industrial and Trade Strategies and growth in the services sector should provide some of that confidence business leaders need to start planning future investments and to consider their hiring activities.”

Commenting, Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said:

“There is more volatility month by month in the jobs market right now, as employers assess a complex picture and hire when they need to, but not yet at the rate they might want to. Much of that hesitation stems from the scar tissue left by the Spring tax hikes and fear of further business tax rises. But underlying this, there are some signs of improving demand. Temporary vacancies, especially in the private sector, are resilient. And we are seeing more sectors adding vacancies in construction, logistics, engineering and healthcare. There is potential out there – if businesses are given a clear run at doing what they do best.

“Clarity and transparency from government is vital to build trust with business and drive recovery. The new roadmap for the Employment Rights Bill allows for full and frank consultation on how the new rules will be shaped and gives breathing space to embattled businesses. Updating workplace protections is important, but striking the right balance with the business growth ambitions is the crucial part.”",,N,,2025-07-14 13:35:22.468302

It took Welch's Fruit Snacks 10 years,Mark Wilson,,,,,https://www.fastcompany.com/91367059/how-hard-is-it-to-remove-artificial-dye-from-food-it-took-welchs-fruit-snacks-10-years,"Today, the company is announcing that it’s removed all artificial dyes from its “mixed fruit” Welch’s Fruit Snacks, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year.
As of today, a simple Welch’s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain.
The other unique challenge facing Welch’s is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.
The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.
“Scientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,” Ramani concedes.","American food is about to look a little bit duller, but that’s probably for the best.

Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. introduced a ban targeting eight synthetic dyes in processed food, Kraft Heinz and General Mills have both committed to removing them across all their product lines by the end of 2027 in what will be the most significant ingredient shift in the processed food industry since the ban of trans fats in 2018.

But PIM Brands—makers of Welch’s Fruit Snacks, the top seller in its category worldwide—posits that this transition may be harder than it looks, at least if companies want to protect the bright color experience of their products.

“It would be darn impossible, in my opinion, to just snap your fingers and say, ‘Okay, we’re gonna make everything better in the next year or two,” says Michael Rosenberg, president & CEO of PIM Brands. “I think Americans are just a little bit more aggressive and punchy and just want to visually enjoy their products.”

It’s a challenge of both consumer expectations around product consistency, but also, in terms of human perception: Bright colors can actually make things taste sweeter or skew our tastebuds in other ways.

Today, the company is announcing that it’s removed all artificial dyes from its “mixed fruit” Welch’s Fruit Snacks, with the remainder of its portfolio transitioning next year. But the road to get here was anything but quick or easy for the company—despite having its own food science team in-house.

Instead, it’s been a 10-year process, the company says, adding that it couldn’t have possibly reacted rapidly to the demands of the new administration.

“It happens that all this coalesced just as the MAGA movement was really intensifying, but that’s just pure coincidence,” says Rosenberg. “Because we started working on this before any of this ever was even on anybody’s radar screen.”

The challenge of natural dyes

The big truth about dyes is that they make up very little of the food we eat—maybe 0.5% of a Welch’s Fruit Snack is added color by volume, according to Bhavna Ramani, chief R&D and production officer of PIM Brands. But their use has still prompted legitimate health concerns from researchers. The synthetic dyes used in the U.S. aren’t actually banned in Europe, but since 2010 manufacturers have had to place a warning label on foods in the region using them. Manufacturers have tried to avoid using these warnings, so their versions of products like Fruit Loops often eliminate artificial dyes and appear duller as a result.

The Welch’s team tracked these concerns a decade ago, and began a plan to transition its product. Its challenges ranged from feasibility (how do you source a color as rare as blue?) to its own scale—the company’s own color suppliers couldn’t meet their demand.

As of today, a simple Welch’s Fruit Snack is a portrait of our complex global industrial supply chain. The majority of its ingredients are a real fruit puree that match the flavor they’re advertising. That means for a strawberry snack, the company uses strawberries rather than defaulting to cheaper ingredients like apples and pears and supplementing flavor with extracts. But these fruits generally don’t supply the amount of color to which artificial dyes have accustomed us: peach, for instance, would be but the faintest shade of orange without dye.

Welch’s approach means that it already sources 30 different fruits from countries around the globe, tracking seasonal produce worldwide so that it can constantly produce all of its flavors of fruit snack. “When it’s hot in one place, it’s cold in another,” says Rosenberg. “So we’re really traversing the globe for our raw materials.”

Shifting to natural dyes meant shifting from a synthetic supply chain, derived from abundant petroleum, to a complex global footprint with similar problems to Welch’s primary fruit sourcing.

advertisement

Imagine that you need a certain fruit to source a certain color. If it’s grown in China instead of India, it will be different due to the climate and terroir. Each fruit’s hue could shift alongside ensuing chemical differences. That means fruits sourced from two different parts of the globe for color need to be constantly rebalanced and mixed appropriately to control each shade. Furthermore, those natural ingredients come with added concerns around contamination and food safety that don’t accompany their sterile synthetic counterparts.

Any color but brown

Making matters tricker is that processed foods add dyes in part because they oxidize, turning food brown over time. That’s specifically a concern for Welch’s, which are mostly oxidation-prone fruit that’s been stabilized in gelatine (which is less color-dependable than drier processed foods due to its water content). The team clarifies that not all products are as tricky to update with natural dyes as their own product—Ramani notes that hard candies, for instance, should be much easier, as desiccant sugars and corn syrup keeps colors more stable. The other unique challenge facing Welch’s is that this fruit creates acidity, and acids, too, will break down natural colors.

Each different color—like the yellows in its orange snacks, and the reds in its strawberry—had to be developed on its own. The company also created a new, proprietary process to add its natural dyes to its puree on the assembly line at a precise moment, using just the right method—and it updated its own packaging to tweak the exchange of oxygen.

Even still, to validate each color, they didn’t want to simply simulate the effects of heat or humidity. So they created the snacks and let them sit on the shelf, analyzing them each month for 18 months to see if the color shifted. The tests involved dozens of different natural dyes to find those that worked best.

“There were times where we’re at, you know, six months, seven months, and we didn’t like the way the color had held up,” says Ramani. “And so then we got to start over again, right back at one month.”

Yellow was the first color Welch’s solved—in 2015, concerns of yellow dyes spiked with research linking them to cancer triggers—and in what the team deemed to be relatively easy fix, it replaced its synthetic yellow with turmeric and annatto (both popular natural yellow dyes Kraft used to update their macaroni and cheese around the same time).

Its other colors are only coming to market now and over the next several months. The new red is made from purple carrot, red grape, and anthocyanins. Of all of the colors, its most difficult update was blue. Despite it filling our oceans and sky, blue is actually one of the world’s rarest colors. The company found its solution in South America’s huito fruit, which looks something like jackfruit crossed with a lime, but develops blue tones when exposed to air. Alongside a little spirulina, it created just the right color.

Trying the new version

After hearing so much about Welch’s commitment to a perfect color switch, as I open two packs of Welch’s Fruit Snacks side-by-side—one with artificial dyes and one with natural—I am surprised that I can definitely see a difference, as can my kids (who do both partake in Welch’s now and again). The naturally dyed snacks are undeniably less saturated, with slightly less rich reds and oranges.

“Scientifically there will never be complete parity between artificial and natural colors,” Ramani concedes. “We conducted side-by-side visual and sensory panels internally and externally . . . most consumers either couldn’t tell the difference, or preferred the new colors knowing they came from natural sources.”

If I weren’t looking at them side-by-side, I’d never know myself. But I do swear the new snacks taste a little less sweet. It’s something my son notes, too, unprompted and unaware of research pointing out just this phenomenon. If we were blindfolded or in a dark movie theater, would we have noticed? We’d need to set up a larger blind taste test to know.

That said, there is no shortage of sweet treats on the market if your only concern is a sugar blast. And as a consumer who has loathed unnecessary artificial dyes for years—perhaps the one health topic on which RFK Jr and scientifically minded liberals agree—I’m only more likely to buy Welch’s now. And watching my kids eagerly nosh on my remaining press samples, it doesn’t seem they’re sweating the changes, either.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms-2/2025/07/p-1-91367059-welchs-natural-colors.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 08:09:17.431266

Nike is said to be focusing on different sports categories across its various brands, including Nike, Jordan, and Converse.

The brand has been grappling with slower sales growth and increasing competition within the global market recently.

In its fourth-quarter revenues of fiscal 2025, Converse recorded a 26% decrease in sales, amounting to $357m on both reported and currency-neutral bases. The brand also saw a 19% drop in annual revenue to $1.7bn, with an 18% decline on a currency-neutral basis.

Revenues at Nike fell 10% to $46.31bn in FY25.

These challenges have led to cost-cutting initiatives and a strategic shift towards performance-oriented sports products.

Carver’s tenure at Converse spanned 15 years and included key leadership positions in North America and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA).

Cain, who has been with Nike for over two decades and currently serves as vice president and general manager of Nike Global Men’s, is set to assume his new responsibilities after a transition period concluding at the end of July.

Cain’s appointment follows a broader series of executive reshuffles at Nike.

In May this year, the company promoted Amy Montagne, Global Women’s VP/GM to president at Nike.

Phil McCartney, formerly VP of Footwear advanced to EVP, chief innovation, design and product officer.

Chief marketing officer Nicole Graham was also promoted to EVP, chief marketing officer to lead Nike, Jordan and Converse.

Heinz Co. and Kraft Foods. News of the potentially impeding breakup was reported July 11 by The Wall Street Journal.

Under the plan, several Kraft products would be spun off into a new entity, and the remaining company would produce and market a portfolio focused on condiments and sauces, including the Heinz brand, the Journal said.

In response to an inquiry from the publication, a Kraft Heinz spokesperson said, “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

The May remarks by Carlos Abrams-Rivera, chief executive officer, prompted speculation Kraft Heinz would shed businesses. Robert Moskow, an analyst with TD Cowen, wrote at the time the announcement meant some businesses would be divested, adding, “We, too, believe KHC should slim down its portfolio.”

In November 2021, the company sold portions of its cheese business to the Lactalis Group and Emmit Roth USA Inc.

The July 2015 merger of Heinz and Kraft was accompanied by considerable investor enthusiasm. Heinz had been acquired two years earlier by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway in a $28 billion deal, a transaction that appeared highly successful before the Kraft merger. Meanwhile, the Kraft grocery business had been separated in 2012 from its snack foods brands (mostly Nabisco), a business that was renamed Mondelez International.

While the Kraft Heinz combination appeared to go well briefly, sales and profits began flagging within a couple of years. Numerous efforts since then have failed to reignite growth. The company’s share price (adjusted for subsequent dividends) recorded its highest monthly close in May 2017 at $63.44 and has not returned to that level since.

It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.
In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.
ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.","(Reuters) -Talks with the South African government have so far yielded little progress to avert the closure of loss-making long steel operations at ArcelorMittal South Africa, the company said on Monday.

The South African unit of world number two steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA initially said in November 2023 it planned to close the two plants, citing weak domestic demand, high electricity tariffs, poor freight logistics and competition from local scrap metal recycling mini-mills and imports from China.

""Regrettably, limited progress has been made to date in redressing the major structural impediments,"" ArcelorMittal South Africa said in a trading update. It said the closure could no longer be postponed beyond September 30 unless a solution is found soon.

South Africa's trade and industry minister Parks Tau told lawmakers on July 4 that the government was in ""firefighting mode"" as it tries to avoid the closure of ArcelorMittal's operations in KwaZulu Natal and near Johannesburg.

The closure of the plants, which supply rail, roads and bars to the construction, mining and manufacturing sectors as well as components for the automotive industry, has been deferred twice as the company and the government sought to save the 3,500 jobs directly under threat.

In March, the steel company postponed the closures to September 30 after the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation injected 1.683 billion rand ($94.22 million) in cash.

Imports have flooded the domestic market, taking up more than 35% of local steel demand, while freight rail service ""deteriorated to its lowest levels ever, resulting in significantly elevated operating risk,"" the steelmaker's statement said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa expects to report a headline loss per share between 0.89 rand and 0.99 rand ($0.0498-$0.0554) for the six months to June 30, narrowing its loss from 1 rand per share during the same period last year.

Sales volumes declined by about 10% in the first half of 2025 compared to last year, the company said.

ArcelorMittal South Africa will release its half-year financial results on July 31.

This ended a five-quarter sequence of expansion in new business and is most likely a reflection of the uncertainty that changing US trade policy is causing.
On a more positive note, all three sectors that make up business activity, were in expansion mode in Dublin in Q2 2025.
The rise in staffing levels in Dublin was softer than in the Rest of Ireland (52.2).
The Overall PMI is based on the output/business activity question from each survey.","The latest PMI survey from S&P Global, shows that business activity in Dublin’s private sector increased in the second quarter of 2025, albeit at the softest rate of expansion since late 2023.

The headline rate stood at 52.2, broadly in line with the 52.6 seen in the previous quarter. Crucially this remains above the 50-point mark that denotes expansion. At 52.6 output across the rest of Ireland increased in line with that in Dublin.

The Capital’s New Orders component contracted for the first time since Q4 2023. It dropped 2.1 pp from the first quarter of the year to 49.9 indicating a marginal contraction. This ended a five-quarter sequence of expansion in new business and is most likely a reflection of the uncertainty that changing US trade policy is causing. In contrast, new orders across the Rest of Ireland expanded to 53.0, up from 52.7 last quarter.

On a more positive note, all three sectors that make up business activity, were in expansion mode in Dublin in Q2 2025. The Manufacturing sector (54.2) showed the strongest rate of growth which was particularly notable as it bounced back from a contraction of 48.9 last quarter. Both the Construction (55.8) and Service (50.3) sectors posted increases in activity but at slower rates than seen in Q1 when they were at 57.8 and 53.4 respectively. Similarly, the Rest of Ireland saw increases in activity in all sectors; Manufacturing (53.4), Service (53.0) and Construction (50.4).

Continuing the trend seen since the opening quarter of 2021, employment increased in the latest three-month period. The modest pace of job creation (51.3) was fractionally quicker than in the opening quarter of 2025 (51.2). The rise in staffing levels in Dublin was softer than in the Rest of Ireland (52.2).

Commenting on the PMI, Andrew Harker, Economics Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence said:

“It was good to see a return to growth in manufacturing production in Dublin, which meant that all three monitored sectors contributed to the overall expansion in business activity seen in the second quarter of the year. Overall, however, the picture was quite subdued, with little movement in new orders during the quarter meaning that firms increased their output and employment only modestly. With US trade policy potentially becoming clearer soon, the Dublin private sector is at something of a crossroads as we enter the second half of the year. We will hopefully see a demand environment more conducive to growth in Q3.”

Despite the increased administrative burden and financial pressure, some insurers may aim to retain coverage by working closely with federal and state partners.
Experts say this shift signals a challenging period for Medicaid insurers navigating policy changes while trying to balance access, cost, and care quality.","President Donald Trump’s new spending bill, known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" is expected to significantly raise administrative costs for Medicaid insurers like UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health’s Aetna, Centene, and Molina, while complicating cost management. The legislation introduces stricter work verification requirements for Medicaid recipients in states that expanded coverage under the Affordable Care Act, requiring proof of employment every six months starting in 2026 or 2027. Experts warn this will overwhelm state Medicaid departments already operating with limited staff and resources.

The bill’s changes may lead to mass disenrollments, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting 7.8 million people could lose coverage by 2034. The process is expected to begin in 2027. This poses a challenge for insurers, as the remaining enrollees are likely to be sicker, increasing healthcare costs and shrinking profit margins. States may also reduce payments to insurers due to federal funding cuts, further tightening margins.

Companies like Centene and Molina, which have significant exposure to Medicaid, could be more impacted than those with diversified portfolios like Aetna and UnitedHealthcare. Insurers may respond by exiting less profitable states, focusing on strongholds with scale, or adjusting plans to retain healthier members. Strategies may include enhanced benefits such as transportation services, social support programs, and perks to make plans more attractive.

Despite the increased administrative burden and financial pressure, some insurers may aim to retain coverage by working closely with federal and state partners. However, the industry could face a period of retrenchment, prioritizing markets where profitability is more predictable.

The joint membership program also sets up a two-way incentive mechanism: Starbucks members can receive 100 Eastern Airlines miles after activation, while Eastern Airlines members can receive a Starbucks gift star.
In terms of accelerating consumption, Starbucks Diamond members can earn 1.5 times Eastern Airlines points reward when purchasing tickets through Eastern Airlines' direct channels; meanwhile, Eastern Airlines platinum, gold, and silver card members can also enjoy 1.5 times star rewards for their consumption at Starbucks.
Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines has long been deeply engaged in Yunnan, possessing extensive route coverage and targeted support experience.","On July 14, Starbucks China announced a comprehensive collaboration with China Eastern Airlines (hereinafter referred to as ""Eastern Airlines""). This partnership not only covers the integration of the joint membership system but also extends to three major areas: co-creation of Yunnan coffee, co-creation in cultural tourism, and co-creation in sustainable development, marking Starbucks China's outstanding innovation in value-based experiences.

""Creating a higher quality 'Star-style life' for our members has always been Starbucks' unwavering pursuit. By partnering with Eastern Airlines, we are bringing our members a completely new 'in-air' experience,"" said Liu Wenjuan, CEO of Starbucks China. ""In the future, whether they are in the clouds or strolling through the city, they will gain a familiar and definitive sense of value.""

Currently, competition in the Chinese coffee market is becoming increasingly intense, and consumer attention is constantly diverting. This move once again demonstrates Starbucks' confidence and determination in deepening its presence in the Chinese market: adhering to a 'long-termism' strategy that focuses on the customer and relies on value-based experiences, to create a higher quality and more valuable 'Star-style life' for Chinese consumers. A cup of coffee is no longer just a medium for functional consumption, but an emotional symbol of a continuous connection between the brand and its users.

Exploring value co-creation under the 'Coffee Journey Model'.

A cup of coffee during travel has become part of modern living. As representative companies deeply focused on user experience in their respective fields, Starbucks and Eastern Airlines have joined forces, with the core focus on building a joint membership system, integrating the Star Enjoy Club and Eastern Airlines’ Wanlihang Club’s membership systems to explore multi-dimensional value co-creation under the 'Coffee Journey Model'.

Members of different tiers from both parties can now initiate the 'Coffee Journey Model', enjoying an exclusive experience covering the full chain of ""membership binding, consumption points, and flight"". For example, on the day of flight travel, Starbucks Diamond Joint members can enjoy free in-flight Wi-Fi, while Eastern Airlines Platinum and Gold Joint members can receive a complimentary medium drink at airport stores without the need to redeem stars or points.

The joint membership program also sets up a two-way incentive mechanism: Starbucks members can receive 100 Eastern Airlines miles after activation, while Eastern Airlines members can receive a Starbucks gift star. In terms of accelerating consumption, Starbucks Diamond members can earn 1.5 times Eastern Airlines points reward when purchasing tickets through Eastern Airlines' direct channels; meanwhile, Eastern Airlines platinum, gold, and silver card members can also enjoy 1.5 times star rewards for their consumption at Starbucks. Members at other levels can receive additional star incentives by meeting spending thresholds within a limited time.

This mechanism not only bridges the membership path between the airline travel and coffee scenarios but also enhances the flexibility of point usage and the perception of the value of membership rights. Unlike traditional shallow collaborations across brands, the 'Coffee Journey Model' emphasizes multiple consumption touchpoints before, during, and after the flight, creating an integrated life chain of 'Coffee + Airline Travel' value co-creation, further enhancing the continuity and stickiness of brand interactions.

This cooperation will also extend to three key co-creation directions, reflecting both parties' innovative exploration around 'value-based experiences' and promoting the transformation of functional consumption into a value-based experiential form that carries more emotional warmth and cultural connections.

First is Yunnan coffee co-creation, where Starbucks and Eastern Airlines have natural synergy in Yunnan. Since establishing its first Asia-Pacific coffee grower support center in Pu'er in 2012, Starbucks has continuously promoted the high-quality development of Yunnan's coffee industry through open-source agronomy support, premium price procurement mechanisms, and brand empowerment. Meanwhile, Eastern Airlines has long been deeply engaged in Yunnan, possessing extensive route coverage and targeted support experience. In this cooperation, the two sides will jointly launch 'Yunnan Coffee Themed Flights' to allow travelers to deeply experience the unique Yunnan coffee culture through multiple forms such as cabin decorations, coffee tastings, film screenings, and themed gifts during the flight.

Secondly, in terms of cultural and tourism co-creation, relying on Starbucks’ network of over 7,700 'third space' stores across the country and Eastern Airlines' deep layout in 'aviation + local' cultural and tourism resources, both parties will jointly create culturally distinctive tourism products and service experiences that enrich the cultural content and emotional value during consumers' travels, thereby promoting local cultural and economic development.

In terms of sustainable development co-creation, both parties adhere to a shared environmental protection philosophy and practice, and will jointly launch a 'Green Flight' project that encourages more customers to participate in green and low-carbon actions, collectively injecting more energy into a sustainable future. Starbucks' long-term investment in eco-friendly packaging and green store operations, combined with Eastern Airlines' aviation experience in energy saving and carbon reduction, will provide solid support for this plan, collaboratively promoting the implementation of green concepts in the travel and consumption chain.

'Coffee +' empowers the membership system, enhancing emotional stickiness.

'Coffee + Airline Travel' cooperation is not only a functional commercial collaboration but also reflects the deep synergy between both parties in brand values, user needs insights, and ecological co-building capabilities. Through this cooperation, Starbucks no longer provides services solely in the 'coffee scenario' but further integrates into a broader life journey, continuously enhancing the brand's cultural connectivity and emotional penetration beyond functional value.

In fact, this innovative exploration is another key initiative for Starbucks to continuously deepen the value of its membership system. Since the launch of the Star Enjoy Club in 2011, this membership system has become an important connecting bridge between the brand and consumers. In June of last year, the Star Enjoy Club membership system underwent a comprehensive upgrade, enhancing exclusivity and participation through the addition of Diamond Star membership levels, a new star redemption mechanism, and gameplay. The upgraded system not only enhances the personalized dimension of user experiences but also becomes a key carrier for Starbucks to build 'value-oriented consumption.'

Meanwhile, Starbucks accelerates its cross-scenario ecological layout, relying on system upgrades to 'break the circle' for the first time in collaboration with Hilton Group to launch a 'Coffee + Hotel' joint membership program, integrating multiple unique benefits that connect travel and daily consumption scenarios.

Data shows that since the upgrade in 2024, the registered members of the Star Enjoy Club have grown from 0.13 billion to 0.16 billion, with a steady increase in loyal members. Among them, the number of active members within 90 days has surpassed 20 million, and the membership sales contribution rate has reached 75%. These numbers reflect not only the emotional stickiness users have towards Starbucks but also demonstrate the strategic value of its membership system in promoting long-term user engagement.

Faced with the common pressure of a 'price war' in the coffee industry, Starbucks consistently chooses 'value' and 'experience depth' as its core competitiveness, and through cross-border collaboration, scenario extension, and membership system upgrades, it continues to empower member rights, expanding the depth and density of user touchpoints, injecting new connotations into its brand moat in the battle for existing customers.

From beverage innovation to spatial resonance, continuously expanding the boundaries of the 'Star' lifestyle.

In addition to the continuous optimization of the membership system, Starbucks' deepening of user value is also reflected in its collaborative layout across three aspects: products, spaces, and cross-content, presenting a strong focus on consumer needs, experience optimization, and an emphasis on local cultural integration.

At the product level, in April of this year, Starbucks officially launched the 'True Taste Sugar-Free' innovative system. This is the result of several months of work by Starbucks China, involving 74 rounds of sensory flavor testing and more than 40 versions for development and iteration, capable of completely separating the flavors and sugars in the original flavored syrups while satisfying consumers' health and sugar reduction demands without sacrificing flavor. As a trial product of this system, the Starbucks Rose 20 and Jasmine 100 series received positive market feedback shortly after their launch in the first quarter, validating the user acceptance of the innovative path.

Customization has always been a very unique beverage customization play for Starbucks, and it has become an important way to establish interaction between the brand and its customers. Consumers can freely combine different sweetness, milk bases, tea bases, and flavor ingredients according to their personal preferences, creating 'their own cup.' This flexibility not only increases customer engagement and fun during ordering but also gives rise to 'secret menus' on Social Media, becoming a source of inspiration for product innovation. The previously popular Hongcha Yuanyang Latte and Fully Iced Americano hidden hits, for instance, are 'Star-style' plays widely communicated by customers that ultimately feed back into the permanent menu, forming a two-way co-creation mechanism between the brand and consumers.

The launch of the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' innovation system further expands the combination space, achieving over 500 different flavor and sweetness pairing options, which undoubtedly enhances the breadth and depth of the customization dimension.

In addition to coffee Ontology, Starbucks is also accelerating the expansion of 'non-coffee' scene layouts to meet consumers' diverse beverage needs throughout the day and across multiple scenarios. In June of this year, Starbucks proposed the consumption rhythm of 'morning coffee, afternoon non-coffee' for the first time, strengthening the three flagship categories of Frappuccino, Iced Shaken Tea, and Tea Latte. In fact, these three categories have already accumulated a stable consumer base due to their unique characteristics, with significant growth potential. Among them, Frappuccino is particularly popular, serving as the 'entry choice' for many non-coffee drinkers to experience Starbucks and is also the mainstay of summer sales. In this push, Starbucks is more leveraging the launch of the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' innovative system to create a certain price space, encouraging more customers to explore customization play.

On the basis of product innovation, Starbucks also actively responds to the current trend of 'emotional consumption' by co-creating cross-industry content, strengthening the emotional connection between the brand and consumers. This year, Starbucks China has collaborated with IPs such as Snoopy and Disney, launching a series of themed beverages, including three iced shaken teas inspired by the three main characters of 'Zootopia.' At the same time, the brand invited Mayday to serve as summer ambassadors, creating a communication bridge that aligns with the cultural interests of younger demographics. Fans of Mayday have also utilized the 'True Flavor Sugar-Free' system to independently customize the 'Bubu Frappuccino,' which has gradually become a 'beverage code' among communities, further deepening emotional identification and participation with the brand.

The rich customization options help consumers escape the monotonous consumption experience, while store space serves as an important interface for the brand to reach users, becoming a cultural field that enriches the 'Star-style life.' Starbucks has always emphasized the localized expression of the 'third space,' avoiding template replication and continues to actively promote the deep expansion of high-quality, localized stores in recent years.

From the Ningbo Dongqian Lake Taolu Street Store 'in the village' to the 'highest altitudinal' store in Yunnan's Yulong Snow Mountain, and then to cultural tourism landmark stores in Jiuzhaigou, Dunhuang, and Zhangye, Starbucks, through localized 'third space' design and site selection strategies, enhances cultural locality and the brand's presence in urban life. This 'non-standardized' spatial layout not only boosts social attributes but also constructs a deeper cultural resonance between the brand and consumers.

Essentially, Starbucks is no longer just a coffee brand in the Chinese market, but is building the ""Star-style"" lifestyle it advocates—a framework of experiences that can be extended, iterated, and embedded into consumers' daily life scenarios. From drink flavors to service scenarios, from the memberships system to cross-border collaborations, Starbucks revolves around ""people"" in its business logic, emphasizing a sense of ""value"" rather than ""price"", offering long-term service that accompanies rather than a one-time Trade conversion.

In an increasingly competitive and rational market environment, the contest of brand power is no longer limited to the product itself, but rather to its ability to position itself within diverse life scenarios, shaping lasting and rich user relationships. Starbucks China is continuously validating this proposition through the ""Coffee+"" model: a cup of coffee is not just the starting point of consumption, but also the entry point that connects lifestyle, cultural identity, and even value choices.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/20220801035174077aff53868dc.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:08:34.551260

At ETBrandEquity's Brand World Summit 2025, marketing leaders unveiled the shift in live entertainment during an intriguing panel discussion. The statistics are nothing short of revolutionary - over 30 million Indians attended live events in 2024, a jaw-dropping three-fold increase from 2019. The live entertainment industry is set to explode, projected to surge from ₹12,000 crore to ₹23,000 crore by 2030.

This is a cultural metamorphosis reshaping how brands connect with audiences. The constellation of marketing leaders who decoded this phenomenon during the panel ""Live Events Unleashed: What CMOs Make of Concert Crazy Indians"" moderated by Anirban Chowdhury, senior assistant editor,The Economic Times revealed insights that are transforming the marketing landscape entirely.

Chandrika Jain, CMO, Lenovo India who sees technology as the heartbeat of culture. ""Technology isn't just a tool; it's the very DNA of modern culture,"" she proclaimed during the discussion. Her 'Brave New Art' initiative has already captured 10 million organic views, proving that creativity knows no boundaries. Her most profound insight resonates throughout the industry: brands must breathe the culture they want to inhabit rather than merely observe it from the outside.

The approach taken by Shantanu Gangane, senior director- integrated marketing experience, Coca-Cola India and Southwest Asia, demonstrates how brands can become cultural anthropologists. ""We don't just support events; we create cultural moments that become generational memories,"" he explained to the assembled marketing leaders. Coca-Cola's Coke Studio isn't just a music platform - it's evolved into a cultural institution that has fundamentally redefined musical collaboration in India, bridging generations and musical traditions.

Vineet Sharma, VP marketing , AB InBev, views live events through an entirely different lens - one that places fans at the absolute centre. ""We're not selling a product; we're crafting experiences that become lifelong memories,"" he shared with the audience. Budweiser's strategy transcends traditional beer marketing; instead, the brand creates immersive narratives that resonate deeply with young India, from NBA collaborations to music festivals that become cultural touchstones.

Fashion intersects with this live entertainment revolution in fascinating ways, as Amit Kothari, head of marketing, H&M eloquently demonstrated. ""Fashion is a language of self-expression,"" he noted during the panel discussion. For H&M, a concert isn't merely an event - it transforms into a runway of personal storytelling where brands become enablers of individual creativity, allowing people to express themselves with joy, positivity, and confidence.

Advt

Understanding Generation Z proves crucial to this transformation, as Akanksha Dalal, marketing director, Mountain Dew, PepsiCo, clearly articulated. ""This generation doesn't just consume content; they want to be part of the narrative,"" she observed. This insight reveals why brands that don't evolve risk becoming cultural footnotes, as Gen Z demands authentic, immersive experiences rather than passive consumption.

What truly transforms these events from mere concerts to cultural phenomena is the alchemy of music, fashion, technology, and genuine human connection. Brands are no longer passive observers but active creators of experiences that resonate on multiple levels. These events have become platforms for self-expression, cultural exchange, and brand storytelling, where concerts serve as canvases for brands to paint their narratives.

Infrastructure remains a significant challenge as these experiences aim to go mainstream. The journey from niche to mass market requires breaking down multiple barriers, with accessibility becoming paramount for widespread adoption. However, the ROI paradigm has shifted fundamentally - success isn't measured in sales alone anymore but calculated in cultural capital, social media engagement, and brand perception. Metrics have become more nuanced, more human.

As India's live entertainment industry strikes its crescendo, brands are discovering that the sweetest melodies emerge when they become part of the symphony rather than merely conducting from the sidelines.

The big picture: This initiative draws a direct line from social media to the Starbucks app — a strategy familiar to Niccol and Tressie Lieberman, Starbucks' global chief brand officer, from their days at Chipotle.

In 2023, the fast-casual chain introduced three menu items based on TikTok users' personalized orders.

However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.

News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier this week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day.

According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalised in the coming weeks.

A company spokesperson said, “As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value.”

Its shares closed up 2.5%.

The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion.

‘Echoes The Kelloggs Spinoff’

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with HJ Heinz, which they bought in 2013.

But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the US after health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

Analyst at Consumer Edge Conor Rattigan said, “KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kelloggs spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time.

“As CPGs (consumer packaged goods makers) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to M&A and/or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory.”",https://img.resized.co/checkout/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzE3MTYzNjAxXFxcL0hlaW56XzM2Mjg1NzI3X20uanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5jaGVja291dC5pZVxcXC9pXFxcL25vaW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjFlMzIxMDc5N2MxODk3NDExYmQwYzYxMzUyYmU4YTk4YjNhNjk5NmQifQ==/kraft-heinz-explores-grocery-business-spinoff-worth-up-to-20bn-checkout.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 09:07:54.623776

A Checklist for Supply Chain Leaders To avoid being caught off guard during peak season, supply chain leaders must act now.","As summer heats up, supply chain leaders are already bracing for the year’s holiday season. From warehousing and logistics to production and fulfillment, every link in the chain must operate at peak performance. But amid the rush to secure seasonal labor and optimize operations, one critical question often goes overlooked:

Do you have the right supervisors in place to lead your teams through the busiest time of the year?

The Hidden Weak Link in the Supply Chain

Research from Express Employment Professionals and The Harris Poll reveals a growing crisis in middle management that’s already straining supply chain performance. Supervisors, the essential bridge between frontline workers and upper management, are burning out, stepping down, or opting out of leadership roles altogether.

55% of supervisors have quit or plan to quit due to a lack of fulfillment or advancement.

33% cite mental health challenges as a reason for leaving.

Younger workers are increasingly rejecting management roles, citing high stress and low reward.

In supply chain environments, where precision, speed, and coordination are non-negotiable, the absence of experienced supervisors can lead to costly disruptions, including missed deadlines, safety incidents, increased turnover, and reduced throughput.

Training Gaps Are Fueling the Fire

Many companies assume they’re preparing supervisors for success, but the data tells a different story. While 86% of hiring managers believe their supervisors have the tools they need, only a fraction offer training in the areas that matter most, such as conflict resolution, emotional intelligence, and providing constructive feedback.

This disconnect is particularly hazardous in supply chain settings, where supervisors must manage diverse teams, resolve real-time issues, and maintain morale under intense pressure. Without proper training and support, even the most capable supervisors can quickly become overwhelmed, leading to burnout, disengagement, and operational breakdowns.

The Cost of Turnover in Supply Chain Roles

When a supervisor leaves, the impact ripples across the entire operation. Productivity drops. Safety risks increase. And the cost of replacing that leader, often 50% to 200% of their annual salary, can be staggering.

In fact, one in five hiring managers say turnover costs their company up to $100,000 per year. In logistics, manufacturing, and distribution, where margins are tight and timelines are critical, such disruptions can derail an entire season.

A Checklist for Supply Chain Leaders

To avoid being caught off guard during peak season, supply chain leaders must act now.

Based on insights from Express franchise owners nationwide, here’s what companies should prioritize to prevent supervisor burnout and turnover:

Set Clear, Reasonable Expectations—Define realistic goals and workloads.

Enforce Time Off—Encourage supervisors to take real breaks to avoid burnout.

Use Contract Workers—Bring in temporary help to manage seasonal spikes.

Train for Real-World Leadership—Focus on conflict resolution, communication, and team management.

Build Peer and Mentorship Networks—Create support systems for supervisors.

Recognize Effort, Not Just Outcomes—Celebrate leadership behaviors, not just KPIs.

Give Supervisors More Autonomy—Empower decision-making on the floor.

Invest in Mental Health Resources—Offer counseling and stress management tools.

Cross-Train Teams—Share responsibilities to reduce pressure on any one role.

Simplify Admin Work—Cut back on busywork that distracts from leadership.

The new facility is supported by a syndicate of 19 leading international and regional banks, with ING Bank N.V., UBS Switzerland AG, Natixis CIB, Banque Internationale de Commerce – BRED (Suisse) SA, and Afreximbank acting as initial Bookrunning Mandated Lead Arrangers (BMLAs).

The potential spin-off comes as Kraft Heinz seeks to address persistent challenges in its grocery segment, which has struggled to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences.
Reports suggest that the spin-off would allow Kraft Heinz to retain its core brands, such as Heinz ketchup, Grey Poupon mustard and a range of sauces, while divesting traditional grocery items like boxed dinners and processed cheese.
Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.
Despite initial optimism surrounding the merger, Kraft Heinz has faced significant hurdles, including inflationary pressures that have negatively impacted demand for its products.","According to reports from major media outlets, including Bloomberg and Financial Times, Kraft Heinz Company is actively considering a significant restructuring that would involve spinning off a substantial portion of its grocery business, which includes several iconic Kraft products.

Sources familiar with the company's situation indicate that this new entity could be valued at as much as $20 billion. However, the exact structure of the deal remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that it will be finalised.

The potential spin-off comes as Kraft Heinz seeks to address persistent challenges in its grocery segment, which has struggled to keep pace with evolving consumer preferences.

The company has been under pressure from shareholders to enhance value, particularly as economic conditions prompt consumers to seek more affordable options and healthier alternatives.

This exploration follows a similar move by WK Kellogg, which recently agreed to a $3.1 billion acquisition by Ferrero, indicating a trend of consolidation in the food sector.

Reports suggest that the spin-off would allow Kraft Heinz to retain its core brands, such as Heinz ketchup, Grey Poupon mustard and a range of sauces, while divesting traditional grocery items like boxed dinners and processed cheese.

Such a separation could potentially position the remaining business for faster growth, capitalising on the increasing consumer demand for condiments and sauces over processed meal solutions.

As of now, Kraft Heinz's market capitalisation stands at approximately $31.33 billion, and the company's shares closed up 2.5% following the news of the potential spin-off.

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods and HJ Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital. Despite initial optimism surrounding the merger, Kraft Heinz has faced significant hurdles, including inflationary pressures that have negatively impacted demand for its products.

The company has also lowered its annual forecasts and reported disappointing results in recent quarters, citing muted consumer spending.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8a42ce_e61303a6250d4f4e8f12c8e88c6ddfdd~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1220,h_686,al_c,q_85/8a42ce_e61303a6250d4f4e8f12c8e88c6ddfdd~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-14 08:10:03.049772

ID13,CVS Health,2025-07-14 09:40:08+00:00,Virginia Mercury,Certain Aetna health insurance plans leaving the Affordable Care Act marketplace next year,"Charlotte Rene Woods, Phil Galewitz",,,,,https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/individual-family-plan-aetna-health-insurance-leaving-the-affordable-care-act-marketplace-next-year/,"Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace.
Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.","Starting next year, Aetna clients in Virginia and other states will no longer be able to purchase individual or family health insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.

Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well.

“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated.

Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.

Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.

As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners).

The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.

An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.”

An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall.

“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads.

Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.

Last year, the company introduced a DCS Card that lets users instantly convert stablecoins into Singapore dollars.
“Consumers can expect better transaction speed and more optimal cost.” But as digital payments grow, strong regulations are needed.
With users wanting fast, borderless payments, Leng believes digital and decentralised tools will keep changing how money moves.
With users demanding real-time, borderless payments, Leng thinks digital and decentralised solutions will continue to reshape the way money moves.","A stablecoin conversion card offers a bridge between crypto and cash.

DCS Card Centre Pte. Ltd is embracing digital asset innovation as superapps, fintechs, and blockchain technology transform the payment landscape.

“The broader payment ecosystem is undergoing a rapid shift in standards, and that is very much propelled by the rise of digital banks and fintechs,” Dayna Leng, chief marketing officer at DCS Card Centre, told Asian Banking & Finance.

Leng noted that the shift isn’t limited to traditional financial institutions.

“They're all coming up with super apps—proprietary wallets like ShopBack Pay, Shopee Pay, GrabPay, and BNPL (buy now, pay later) options even in nonfinance apps,” she said via video teleconference. “All of this is moving towards creating this new level of standard for financial institutions.”

DCS, formerly Diners Club Singapore, has expanded beyond issuing credit and charge cards to include broader payment solutions and, more recently, Web3 services.

Last year, the company introduced a DCS Card that lets users instantly convert stablecoins into Singapore dollars. This means customers can spend their digital assets directly, while merchants still receive payment in fiat currency.

“For Web3 community [members] who really want to have cash on hand from the stablecoins that they owned, they can do that through a physical card,” Leng said. “They can withdraw from the ATM.”

She said the payment space is now more fluid than ever, as digital tools blur the lines between traditional finance and decentralised systems.

“We have gone from debit to credit to mobile to digital, from operating within the traditional finance ecosystem to dual real payments across both [traditional finance] and Web3 economies,” Leng said.

This shift includes programmable tokens—smart contracts that make payments automatically when certain conditions are met. Banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and DBS Bank Ltd. are exploring this, and Leng sees it as a step toward better system integration.

Successful financing accelerates CityFibre’s next phase of growth and boosts UK economy

CityFibre, the UK’s largest independent full fibre platform, has reached agreement with its shareholders and existing lenders on a major £2.3bn financing round, accelerating its next phase of growth.

The financing includes £500m in new equity secured from CityFibre shareholders, Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding, underscoring their continued commitment to CityFibre’s long term strategy and the company’s role in providing critical digital infrastructure across the UK.

CityFibre has also agreed a committed £960m expansion of its existing debt facilities, supported by lenders including ABN AMRO, BBVA, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo IMI CIB, Lloyds, the National Wealth Fund, NatWest, SEB and Société Générale. The facility will support CityFibre’s continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers across its nationwide network.

An accordion facility of £800m is also being made available to help drive CityFibre’s continued expansion through the acquisition of full fibre network assets. This facility will be used to finance the company’s M&A pipeline and cement its position as the sector consolidator.

Greg Mesch, CEO of CityFibre, said: “This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre’s next phase of growth, as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network, for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

“There is huge opportunity ahead for CityFibre and it is testament to the success of the company that we have such strong backing from our lenders and shareholders. This multi-billion-pound investment into critical digital infrastructure will deliver significant benefits across the UK, helping to realise potential and unlocking economic growth.”

This investment marks a significant moment in upgrading the UK’s digital infrastructure. It will deliver world-class infrastructure and services to millions of consumers and businesses and provide the digital foundations for the UK’s economic growth for decades to come.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said: “Today’s announcement shows Britain is attracting billions of pounds of investment, including through the National Wealth Fund, driving growth across British businesses.

“Investing in our digital infrastructure is key to ensuring our economy is fit for the future. Through our Plan for Change we’re growing the economy by boosting investment in Britain and working hand in hand with businesses to create jobs, to put more money in working people’s pockets.”

Secretary of State for Technology, Peter Kyle said: ""This investment in CityFibre is welcome news. It's proof our telecoms industry is driving investment into the UK, as well as building the digital foundations that will serve generations to come.

“The success of the UK's network providers will help accelerate the rollout of gigabit-capable broadband to millions of homes and businesses across the country. I hope to see even more success stories like this one, because this sector is critical not just to improving internet speeds, but to transforming quality of life for communities and creating opportunities in every part of the country as part of our Plan for Change.""

Over the past 12 months, CityFibre has announced its first full year of profitability1, launched Sky’s full fibre and Gigafast+ services across CityFibre’s nationwide network, completed the integration of Lit Fibre, announced the acquisition of Connexin’s full fibre infrastructure2 and reached more than 4.5 million premises with its full fibre network, over half way to CityFibre’s milestone of 8 million premises.

However, the structure of the deal could change and there is no guarantee Kraft Heinz would move forward with any such deal, the source said.

News of the potential move is the second effort this week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier this week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a $3.1 billion (€2.7 billion) buyout deal from Italy's Ferrero.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the development earlier in the day. According to the report, a split, which would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, could be finalised in the coming weeks.

""As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,"" a company spokesperson said.

Its shares closed up 2.5%. The company currently has a market value of $31.33 billion (€26.82 billion).

A Challenging Investment

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for Kraft Heinz's lunch combos and other products. It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the US after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

""KHC spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spinoff in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,"" said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

""As CPGs (consumer packaged goods makers) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to M&A and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,"" Rattigan said.",https://img.resized.co/esmmagazine/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLm1hZGlzb25wdWJsaWNhdGlvbnMuZXVcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDIxXFxcLzA1XFxcLzEwMTQxMDM0XFxcL0tyYWZ0X0hlaW56XzgzMDUyNjExX20uanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltZy5yZXNpemVkLmNvXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI5ZTUxMGYyMTBmZTNjYmI0N2RmN2E4MjUwZDIzMjk4ZGFkZGQwODhkIn0=/kraft-heinz-explores-grocery-business-spinoff-worth-up-to-20bn-source-says.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:06:52.216030

In commemoration of their annual social responsibility week, AXA Week for Good, hundreds of the company’s employees visited various schools across Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, educating students and teachers on the identification, prevention, and reporting of sexual and domestic violence.

AXA Week for Good is the flagship volunteering programme of AXA Hearts In Action (AHIA), a programme through which AXA encourages its employees to contribute to positive societal and environmental impacts through volunteering, expertise, related financial support, and in-kind donations.

Through the AHIA, our employees do not just give time to great causes; we work together for a better future. We share our knowledge and expertise as a people with a shared purpose of acting for human progress by protecting what matters by helping vulnerable communities and people around us, said Rashidat Adebisi, Chief Client Officer, AXA Mansard.

Under the theme “Being a Girl Shouldn’t Be A Risk,” AXA Mansard employees participated in awareness walks to sensitize the public about the danger of domestic and sexual violence on children and the nation’s future.

According to Adebisi, this theme presents the organization with an opportunity to demonstrate the social, economic, and ethical benefits of protecting the girl child. She said Nigeria’s 105 million children and adolescents aged 0–17 years represent about half of the country’s population.

For a country betting its economic growth on the strength and human capital of its young population, the alarming rate and spate of Violence Against Children (VAC) threaten the future not just of our country, but of the African continent.

She noted that the staggering reality that 60% of Nigerian children experience one or forms of violence before age 18 is a call to action for everyone, and our employees are responding to this clarion call so that the thousand of Nigerian girls who go through physical, emotional, sexual and psychological violence can find safe places to get help; but most important, we can rid our society of perpetrators, she furthered.

Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley reacted positively to Rose's appointment after WPP announced the news on July 10.
We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list.
WPP has the most brilliant, talented, creative people, and I can't wait to write the company's next chapter together.”","Martin Sorrell, founder and executive chairman of S4 Capital, has said that WPP may be “too far gone” for incoming chief executive Cindy Rose to have the effect needed to turn around the business.

The founder and former CEO of WPP, who has previously advocated for the sale of the holding company’s media arm WPP Media (then known as Group M), again raised the question of whether or not WPP may be “better off” breaking down its units to sell them off, criticising outgoing CEO Mark Read’s leadership over the past seven years.

Speaking to Campaign, he said: “Cindy Rose’s operating experience at Disney, Vodafone and Microsoft may be stellar and she may be very talented, but the question is whether the business is too far gone as a result of the approach of the last seven years and would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.”

The market cap of rival Publicis is now four times the size of WPP and WPP issued a profit warning for Q2, revising its full year revenue forecast to a decline of between 3% and 5%.

Sorrell quipped: “I’m sure John Wren [the CEO of Omnicom], with 20:20 hindsight, would have preferred to acquire WPP rather than IPG. In any event, the jury is out.”

Primarily, Sorrell added, WPP “needs leadership, a new strategy and a clear structure” to rival the “clear strategy around digital, data and media and a country-led structure”, which, according to him, Publicis has.

Rose, he continued, fits the criteria sought by WPP chairman Philip Jansen, but, he noted, she will have to “be located in, and 24/7 laser-focused on, the US, undoubtedly the centre of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralised”.

The US was among the first of WPP’s markets to face job cuts as part of the restructure of Group M and employees were disgruntled earlier this year by Read’s return-to-office mandate.

Sorrell expressed scepticism over agencies’ ability to build software-as-a-service type businesses, as WPP is attempting to do with Open, in competition with companies like Adobe, which are already dedicated to such a set-up.

He also pointed to client and talent losses as the result of the ""collapse"" of brands, including Wunderman, J Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as a cause for concern.

He said: “WPP has spent over £1.5bn over the last five years below the headline operating profit line on mostly cash restructuring charges and built up multiple levels of overhead at group, sub-group and company levels.

“Under the guise of simplification, the leadership has collapsed storied brands such as J Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, Wunderman, Grey, Hill&Knowlton, losing not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.”

WPP has been approached for comment.

Analysts at Barclays and Morgan Stanley reacted positively to Rose's appointment after WPP announced the news on July 10. However, they flagged up her lack of experience in capital markets and within ad agencies.

Jansen praised Read for his “tireless commitment” and “progress he has made to modernise, simplify and transform the company over the last seven years as CEO” in the statement to the stock market about Rose’s appointment.

She was also optimistic about the agency group's future: “WPP is a company I know and love — not only from my six years on the board [as a WPP non-executive director] but as a client and partner for many years before that — and I couldn't be happier or more excited to be appointed as CEO.”

Rose added, “There are so many opportunities ahead for WPP. We have and continue to build market-leading AI capabilities, alongside an unrivalled reputation for creative excellence and a pre-eminent client list. WPP has the most brilliant, talented, creative people, and I can't wait to write the company's next chapter together.”",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2f20250714015938_Untitled+design+(2).png&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 05:04:10.635547

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels. This follows US President Donald Trump's tariff announcement on the European Union. The EU is a major trade partner for the US. The EU is delaying retaliatory tariffs. They hope to reach a trade deal with the US. Negotiations will continue. The EU is also exploring new markets.

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels on Monday, following U.S. President Donald Trump's surprise announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union.

The EU is America's biggest business partner and the world's largest trading bloc. The U.S. decision will have repercussions for governments, companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.

""We shouldn't impose countermeasures at this stage, but we should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox,"" said Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. ""So we want a deal, but there's an old saying: 'If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.'""

The tariffs, also imposed on Mexico, are set to start on Aug. 1 and could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the U.S., and destabilize economies from Portugal to Norway.

Meanwhile, Brussels decided to suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods scheduled to take effect Monday in hopes of reaching a trade deal with the Trump administration by the end of the month.

Live Events

The ""countermeasures"" by the EU, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of its 27 member countries, will be delayed until Aug. 1.

Trump's letter shows ""that we have until the first of August"" to negotiate, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday.

MaroS Šefčovič, the EU's trade representative in its talks with the U.S., said negotiations would continue

""I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,"" he told reporters in Brussels on Monday.

""I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.""

The letters to the EU and Mexico come in the midst of an on-and-off Trump threat to impose tariffs on countries and right an imbalance in trade.

Trump imposed tariffs in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. As the three-month grace period ended this week, he began sending tariff letters to leaders, but again has pushed back the implementation day for what he says will be just a few more weeks.

If he moves forward with the tariffs, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.

In the wake of the new tariffs, European leaders largely closed ranks, calling for unity but also a steady hand to not provoke further acrimony.

Just last week, Europe was cautiously optimistic.

Officials told reporters on Friday they weren't expecting a letter like the one sent Saturday and that a trade deal was to be inked in ""the coming days."" For months, the EU has broadcast that it has strong retaliatory measures ready if talks fail.

Reeling from successive rebukes from Washington, Šefčovič said Monday the EU is ""doubling down on efforts to open new markets"" and pointed to a new economic agreement with Indonesia as one.

The EU top brass will visit Beijing for a summit later this month while courting other Pacific nations like South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore, the Philippines, and Indonesia, whose prime minister visited Brussels over the weekend to sign a new economic partnership with the EU. It also has mega-deals in the works with Mexico and a trading bloc of South American nations known as Mercosur.

While meeting with Indonesia's president on Sunday, Von der Leyen said that ""when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together.""

The making of the NewMatter pump “We used NewMatter resin for the pump because we wanted to show that beauty packaging can be made from beauty waste,” said Ross of Credo.
“This is a really high value source of plastic.” One pound of plastic waste stays out of landfills or oceans for every 38 pumps that Credo makes, according to Pact.
Next steps Beyond the pump, Pact also turned recycled high-density polyethylene into soap dishes with Terrazzo-like flecks in them.","Less than 10 percent of single-use plastic is recycled, most of it bottles and jugs.

In the cosmetics industry, for example, few of the 120 billion units of lotion pumps, mascara wands and other components made each year are recycled, according to the Pact Collective.

The San Francisco nonprofit has gathered 140 cosmetics makers and retailers — including Sephora, Ulta Beauty and L’Oréal — to attack small-format plastic waste. Pact maintains more than 3,300 bins for spent makeup jars, lids and applicators at North American stores including Nordstrom Rack and Saks Fifth Avenue.

To further its mission, the collective created something new from nearly 232 tons of detritus it has collected since 2022. Last year, as its collection volumes tripled, the organization transformed piles of plastics into a novel resin.

Credo Beauty, a founding member of Pact, then used that resin, called NewMatter, to create recyclable pumps for its moisturizer bottles. Those pumps usually blend several types of plastic with a metal coil, which prevents its recycling. Credo, however, used a single material — polypropylene — to make it easier to recycle later. Now that it has cracked this challenge, Pact seeks to encourage investors and infrastructure builders to support systems to collect, sort and recycle more small-format plastics.

“As the first beauty retailer to co-create a recycled resin from hard-to-recycle empties, we saw an opportunity to show circularity at work,” said Christina Ross, head of science and impact at Credo Beauty, a founding member of the Pact Collective. “This pump became a proof point and we can’t wait to see what brands do with the material next.”

Banding together

As international negotiations continue on a global plastics treaty, Pact isn’t the only corporate collaboration trying to keep packaging components out of landfills and incinerators. In February, the Consortium for Small Formats launched with backing from L’Oréal Groupe, Kraft Heinz and P&G. Individual brands’ efforts at circular packaging include refill programs from the likes of Kiehl’s and customer collection programs run by nonprofit Terracycle for Sephora and MAC.

Members of the U.S. Plastics Pact, meanwhile, have focused on sweeping benchmarks for reducing the proliferation of petroleum-based plastics, but their 2025 and 2030 deadlines are slipping out of reach.

“We are taking a different angle,” said Pact Collective Executive Director Carly Snider. “We’re collecting this material and then proving that it has value.” The initial heavy lift shows that certain cosmetics plastics can be integrated into municipal recycling systems, she added. “I’m hopeful that we can have this case study to show that this material has value, and therefore it’s worth the investment to your infrastructure for us to collect this material curbside.”

Pact’s June 26 impact report described how Credo’s custom pump, announced in September, fit into a busy year of scaling up recycling. Ninety-eight percent of the paper, glass and metal collected by Pact has been recycled. So has 70 percent of sorted, clean plastics.

Retail collection bins are core to Pact’s mission to grow as a household name for consumers, three-quarters of whom care about sustainable packaging, according to the nonprofit. Pact also collected 88,959 pounds of industrial waste of returns and expired or damaged goods last year.

The making of the NewMatter pump

“We used NewMatter resin for the pump because we wanted to show that beauty packaging can be made from beauty waste,” said Ross of Credo. “No one had ever made a high-functioning component from post-consumer beauty packaging before, so we knew the road wouldn’t be easy but also that it mattered.”

The journey to make the recycled pump started as Pact’s consumer-and-industrial packaging streams shipped to a plant in Lake Zurich, Illinois. After being sorted into 14 categories, the would-be trash was sent to mechanical recycling partners.

Next, the plastic recycler shredded and turned the waste into pellets.

The recycler required some 40,000 pounds of incoming material, which Pact’s collections alone did not reach. Therefore, Credo’s fully polypropylene pump blended 84 percent of material from Pact’s collection bins with 16 percent ocean-bound plastic gathered by hand in Malaysia. “It took a lot of work with them to figure out ways that we can get this material in there,” Snider said. “This is a really high value source of plastic.”

One pound of plastic waste stays out of landfills or oceans for every 38 pumps that Credo makes, according to Pact.

Next steps

Beyond the pump, Pact also turned recycled high-density polyethylene into soap dishes with Terrazzo-like flecks in them. “It’s really creating a way that customers can hold circularity in their hands,” Snider said. “It’s not this abstract thing.”

Credo is exploring where else it can use NewMatter resin, such as closures and other components that tend to be hard to recycle.

“Now that the infrastructure is set up to use take-backs on a more circular level, we need to continue to create a demand for post-consumer beauty-grade materials,” Ross said. That includes exploring how extended producer responsibility regulations cropping up in multiple states can help brands to advance innovative packaging, she added.

“You’re missing a huge piece of the puzzle here by just sending this to the landfill and not being able to sell it again,” Snider, of Pact, said.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/trellis_editorial_credo_beauty_1470x894.png,N,,2025-07-14 05:03:25.836721

Ageras aims for more acquisitions Founded in 2012 by Rico Andersen and Martin Hegelund, Ageras operates a software platform that serves over 400,000 small businesses across Europe.
With more than 30 years of combined experience in building internet companies, the founders created Ageras to simplify administration for small businesses.
According to the CEO, Rico Andersen, Ageras plans to continue expanding through further acquisitions to grow its presence in the European market.","Copenhagen-based Ageras, a software platform for accounting, administration, and banking for small businesses, has acquired Amsterdam’s Employes, a payroll software company.

This is Ageras’s second acquisition in 2025 and its eighth overall. The company has expanded its operations in several European markets, including through the 2024 acquisition of Shine from Société Générale. With the acquisition of Employes, Ageras adds payroll software to its services in the Netherlands.

Rico Andersen, CEO and co-founder of Ageras, completed the acquisition of Danish payment reconciliation software company Storebuddy in 2025.

With the latest acquisition, Andersen says, “Employes is a perfect match for Ageras as they too believe in putting business owners first, and building a product that radically simplifies their administration.”

“The acquisition doesn’t just make our Dutch offering much stronger, but also gives us a proven, scalable platform to do even more with payroll – ultimately changing the way small businesses pay their wages and take the pain out of payroll. No doubt, this is our most significant acquisition since Shine joined us last year.”

Payroll administration, simplified

Founded in 2018 by Rob Kroezen and Marius van den Oever, Employes provides a platform that allows businesses in the Netherlands to manage payroll independently within the country’s regulatory framework.

Currently, the company serves over 6,000 businesses and is used or recommended by more than 300 bookkeeping firms.

Co-founder Rob Kroezen, who will stay on the combined journey with Ageras, says, “We started Employes because we were frustrated with how difficult payroll management was for small business owners. Joining Ageras gives us the scale, reach, and resources to bring our product to even more entrepreneurs, and we’re therefore very excited for what’s ahead.”

Ageras has acquired Employes as part of its expansion. Employes’ teams in Amsterdam and Zwolle will now join Ageras’ workforce of approximately 450 people, a number that increased during 2024.

Ageras aims for more acquisitions

Founded in 2012 by Rico Andersen and Martin Hegelund, Ageras operates a software platform that serves over 400,000 small businesses across Europe. With more than 30 years of combined experience in building internet companies, the founders created Ageras to simplify administration for small businesses.

The platform integrates invoicing, accounting, payroll, banking, and financing into one system, enabling business owners to manage their operations more efficiently. Ageras is backed by investors including Investcorp, Coller Capital, Lazard, Rabo Frontier Ventures (Rabobank), and Folketrygdfondet.

In its 2024 annual results, Ageras reported an EBITDA of €8.7M and revenue of €55.5M, reflecting a 114 per cent increase. According to the CEO, Rico Andersen, Ageras plans to continue expanding through further acquisitions to grow its presence in the European market.

Andersen says, “Small businesses across Europe are increasingly looking for all-in-one platforms to run their businesses. Payroll is a crucial piece of that puzzle, however, it does not conclude our vision to empower businesses everywhere to spend less time on admin and more time on what matters. Therefore, we will still be scouting the market for the right opportunities to arise in Europe.”",https://siliconcanals.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Employes-co-founders-Marius-van-den-Oever-and-Rob-Kroezen-Image-credit-Employes.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:07.601062

“From a regional perspective, North America PC shipments declined 0.5% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year,” said Padhi.
“The total PC market in APAC remained flat year-over-year, which is a slight improvement after consecutive quarters of decline.
Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5.3% year-over-year.
Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9% year-over-year.","Worldwide PC shipments totaled more than 63 million units in the second quarter of 2025, a 4.4% increase from the second quarter of 2024, according to preliminary results by Gartner, Inc.

Expert Take:

“In the second quarter of 2025, enterprise demand outpaced consumer demand, underpinned by Windows 11 migrations and pandemic-era desktop renewals, while consumer refreshes slowed as buyers deferred purchases,” said Rishi Padhi, Research Principal at Gartner. “PC shipments are forecast to rise 2.4% in 2025, propelled by a tariff-driven front-loaded inventory surge in the first half of 2025 in the U.S., and ongoing Windows 11 replacement cycles in the rest of the world. In the second half of 2025, shipment growth is expected to plateau as vendors draw down stock in response to demand, potentially creating excess inventory by year-end.

“From a regional perspective, North America PC shipments declined 0.5% in the second quarter of 2025, compared to the same time last year,” said Padhi. “The total PC market in APAC remained flat year-over-year, which is a slight improvement after consecutive quarters of decline. Meanwhile, the EMEA PC market grew 5.3% year-over-year. This illustrates signs of a modest recovery and stronger-than-usual seasonal demand. The Windows 11 refresh cycle remains a key driver, particularly for desktop replacements. However, the expected surge in new device purchases has been subdued, as many organizations opt to update existing PCs to Windows 11 rather than invest in new hardware.”

There were no major changes in the top five vendor rankings worldwide in the second quarter of 2025 (see Table 1). Lenovo saw the strongest growth in global PC shipments among the top five vendors at 13.9% year-over-year.

The tariffs could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals more expensive in the US. Trump has also imposed a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico, according to a post from his Truth Social account.

Meanwhile the EU’s retaliatory tariffs on US exports have been delayed again, reports the BBC. The countermeasures, which were due to start on Tuesday, came in response to US President Donald Trump’s initial import taxes on steel and aluminium. The EU’s retaliation, which would have hit € 21bn worth of US goods, was first suspended in March. This break has been extended until early August, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a press conference on Sunday.

Morrisons has told ‘idling’ shop floor staff they will no longer be allowed access to stockrooms as the supermarket races to boost customer service ratings, the Telegraph reports. The supermarket has written to staff saying that new restrictions will mandate which of them are allowed in backrooms, to ensure it had “the right colleagues in the right place to deliver the best service to customers at all times”. Only authorised managers and staff will be allowed to enter stores’ warehouse areas from August.

The Bank of England is ready to make larger cuts to interest rates if the jobs market shows signs of a pronounced slowdown, The Times reports. The governor of the bank, Andrew Bailey, told the newspaper there was “consistent” evidence of businesses “adjusting employment” after Rachel Reeves increased employers’ national insurance contributions (NICs). He said Britain’s economy was growing behind its potential, opening up “slack” that would help to bring down ­inflation, which is expected to rise above 3.4% when official figures for June are published this week.

Louis Vuitton has said the data of some UK customers has been stolen, as it became the latest retailer targeted by cyberattackers, reports The Guardian. The retailer said an unauthorised third party had accessed its UK operation’s systems and obtained information such as names, contact details and purchase history. The brand, which last week said its Korean operation had suffered a similar cyber-attack, told customers that no financial data such as bank details had been compromised.

The company behind brands including McVitie’s biscuits and Jacob’s crackers is to pump millions of pounds into its UK operations in an effort to “supercharge” growth, according to The Times. Pladis has revealed it will plough £68 million into its British business, with the bulk to be spent on its manufacturing sites in the northwest, including Stockport, Carlisle and Aintree. Pladis, which owns United Biscuits, said the cash would be used to increase capacity, capability and productivity by modernising infrastructure in its factories and launching more automated production lines.

Kraft Heinz, the US food group, is preparing to break itself up, spinning off a large part of its groceries business into a new entity that could be valued at as much as $20 billion, according to The Times. The remaining company would focus on its faster-growing sauces and condiments brands including Heinz Tomato Ketchup and the Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon.

The decision comes after the company in May said it was considering several options to reverse its persistent underperformance, reports the Financial Times. One of the plans being considered includes spinning off much of its traditional grocery portfolio.

Talks to rescue Britain’s biggest bioethanol plant are on a knife-edge after the government offered only a partial bailout focusing on the production of carbon dioxide used in fizzy drinks and to preserve food, The Times reports. Vivergo, which is owned by FTSE 100 company Associated British Foods (ABF), is set to close in two months unless a taxpayer rescue can be agreed.

More small businesses expect to downsize or shut up shop than grow over the next 12 months, reports The Times, citing a survey by one of the UK’s most influential trade bodies. Of those surveyed, 27% of owners expect their businesses to either close, shrink or be sold in the coming year, according to the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Only 25 per cent believed their businesses would expand.

Britain’s heatwave is ‘burning the economy’, says a piece in The Telegraph, which begins by focusing on Rob Davies’ dairy and arable farm in Herefordshire. “Grass is a very important crop for us, and our grass yields currently are down by about 50pc,” says Davies. “Maize is also looking to be around 50% down.” His struggles are only one example of the many ways hotter temperatures are affecting Britain’s economy, with visits to shops down 1.8% last month.

Shareholders in the owner of Boots have voted overwhelmingly in favour of being taken over by an American private equity firm, creating uncertainty over the future of the high street pharmacy chain, according to The Times. About 96% of votes cast by shareholders approved the takeover of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) by Sycamore Partners in a $10 billion deal, a fraction of the $100 billion the US pharmacy chain was worth a decade ago.

A fried chicken war broke out in the UK after two American restaurant chains hired private detectives and lawyers to fight over Britain’s fast food future, according to the Telegraph. Legal papers seen by the newspaper reveal a bizarre battle in which lawyers grappled with the popularity of “Southern comfort food” and even asked whether “James Bond could become obsessed with Nashville hot chicken”. The dispute was triggered by a “cult” American fast food chain’s recent expansion into the UK to meet the nation’s growing appetite for fatty foods.

The boss of the pub chain Greene King has called for changes to business rates to remedy “unfairness” that he said added to financial pressures on the struggling pubs industry, according to The Guardian. Nick Mackenzie, Greene King’s chief executive, said the business rates system of property taxes should be changed to a tax on profits. The trade body the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said last week it expected pub closures at a rate of more than one a day during 2025.

Pubs are struggling to turn a profit despite the sunny weather as Labour drags its heels on tax reform, reports the Daily Mail. Drinkers are flocking to beer gardens for a pint but industry leaders say business rates mean takings are being drained away – despite pledges by Labour to change the system. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has piled on further pain with a rise in employer national insurance contributions that took effect in April.

Manufacturing output across all UK regions is back above pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The Times cites a report published on Monday from the manufacturing lobby group Make UK and accountants BDO which underlines the bounce-back from Covid, when grounded airlines, a lack of demand and supply chain disruption brought some factories.

The boss of coffee giant Lavazza has said hedge funds are to blame for pushing up the price of a morning brew, according to the Daily Mail. Giuseppe Lavazza said speculation by the big financial firms was responsible for the vast majority of the surge in prices on wholesale coffee bean markets. He said: ‘Hedge funds are really big players and they make a lot of difference, especially in the volatility of the market and the uncertainty of the market.’

The Bank of England will monitor the use of cash payments amid fears that vulnerable groups risk being excluded, the Telegraph reports.

One option on the table for the group is a separation of the groceries part of its portfolio, containing the ready meals and processes cheese products, from the more lucrative sauces and condiments operation, including the Heinz brand.

The potential move comes a decade after Warren Buffett and 3G Capital merged Heinz and Kraft, and it follows an announcement in May that the group was considering a number of options to turn around its performance.

Executives at Kraft Heinz expect splitting the group up will create two companies worth more than the current group market value of $31bn, according to reports in The Wall Street Journal, which first covered the story.

A split could be finalised within the coming weeks but the board has yet to make a final decision, according to people involved in the discussions. There is a still a possibility assets will be sold off instead, with the group remaining as one entity.

US crude shipments to India rose 51% year-on-year to 271,000 barrels per day between January and June, up from 180,000 bpd a year earlier, while imports from Brazil surged 80% to 73,000 bpd, compared to 41,000 bpd during the same period in 2024. These were the highest growth rates across India’s import portfolio, underscoring a decisive pivot toward Western Hemisphere barrels.

The increase follows multiple converging developments. India’s state-run refiners have sought to insulate procurement from OPEC+ volatility and disruptions in the Middle East. Reduced Chinese liftings of US crude opened spot-market opportunities, while freight rates from the Atlantic Basin fell, improving arbitrage economics.

Diplomatic engagement also played a role. Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri met with Brazilian energy officials earlier this year, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Washington visit in April included energy cooperation as a key agenda item.

Russia retained its top position with 1.67 million bpd in H1 2025, though growth plateaued. Iraqi and Saudi volumes declined marginally, while Nigerian shipments rose 26% to 158,000 bpd.

India is believed to have doubled crude liftings, partly as a signal to US policymakers amid trade pressures. Broader tariff negotiations are still underway.

Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said the nationwide application is the ""logical next step"" after the success of the SA case.
Willox warned that the application to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers.

Gerard Dwyer, National Secretary of the SDA, said the nationwide application is the ""logical next step"" after the success of the SA case.

""That ruling by the Fair Work Commission confirmed what was always obvious: that McDonald's stores, whether franchisees or corporate – share common interests and that workers should be able to bargain together,"" Dwyer said in a statement.

Dwyer added that it is clear that workers should be able to bargain for improved wages and conditions.

""In short, these young, low-paid workers – many in their first jobs – should be able to say: 'I'll have bargaining with that,'"" he stated.

'Sadly inevitable escalation'

The Australian Industry Group (Ai Group) said the union's win in SA ""emboldened"" it to bargain for a multi-employer agreement across all McDonald's restaurants nationwide.

""The SDA application represents a dramatic and sadly inevitable escalation of the Government's multi-bargaining laws across the economy, well beyond what the Government suggested would occur when it pushed through the laws in late 2022,"" said Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox in a statement.

Willox warned that the application to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers.

According to Willox, the development could expose other employers across the fast-food, retail, hospitality, and numerous other sectors to the risk of being drawn into multi-employer bargaining.

""Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission,"" he said.

""Australian Industry Group urges the Federal Government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act to tighten up the scope of the supported bargaining stream, and to address the unintended consequences reflected in the FWC's decision.""

The new ""Strato"" from Starbucks aims to stand out with a layer of cold foam with flavors, according to The Street.
For many consumers, Starbucks becomes the easiest and most reliable option.
With its new Strato Frappuccinos already in stores, Starbucks seeks to attract its most loyal audience again.
The brand is betting on strengthening its leadership in the competitive market for cold and sweet drinks in the United States.","In many cities across the United States, it's easy to notice the dominance of large chains. Small family businesses have closed or have been absorbed by giants. The pandemic accelerated this process and completely changed the commercial landscape up to the present day.

Now, Starbucks announces a move to further consolidate its position. The coffee chain is launching a special line of drinks for the summer, following the strategy of its competitors. On July 8, three new Frappuccinos arrived with a layer of flavored cold foam called ""Strato,"" available only for a limited time.

Starbucks bets on strengthening its presence

The company isn't unfamiliar with the tough competition in the sector. Although it has more than 200 locations just in Manhattan, where millions of tourists and workers pass through each year, it can't rest on its laurels. Starbucks has seen how brands like Chick-fil-A and Wendy's take advantage of the summer to attract customers with sweet and eye-catching new products.

Chick-fil-A, for example, has bet on peach drinks for the season. Wendy's isn't far behind and has launched the new Frosty Swirls with sweet syrups. Faced with this competition, Starbucks is strengthening its offerings to keep its image as the reliable and approachable brand that its customers know.

The new ""Strato"" from Starbucks aims to stand out with a layer of cold foam with flavors, according to The Street. Consumers will be able to choose between Salted Caramel Mocha, Strawberry Matcha, or Brown Sugar. The idea is to replace the classic whipped cream and give an innovative twist to the popular Frappuccinos.

An efficient business model

The success of Starbucks is based on convenience and customer trust. In its locations, consumers know what to expect. Its massive expansion strategy may seem costly or redundant, but it proves effective by ensuring a presence in almost every part of the city.

If one location is full, it's likely to find another just a few blocks away. This model ensures capturing the extra demand that would arise in other smaller coffee shops. For many consumers, Starbucks becomes the easiest and most reliable option.

However, the chain has had to face certain challenges after the pandemic. The return of customers to offices caused unexpected demand. At the same time, there were issues with staff turnover. To solve this, Starbucks has invested in its Siren system, which speeds up the preparation of complicated drinks, although these changes take time to implement.

With its new Strato Frappuccinos already in stores, Starbucks seeks to attract its most loyal audience again. It also wants to win over those looking for something different for the summer.

The facility will support their “continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers“.
CityFibre’s strategy around this thus remains somewhat unproven, and any new funding deal they strike now will be subject to less favourable conditions than they had before (e.g.
Put another way, this may not be the last funding deal they’ll need, which means that some of the same underlying funding challenges could still resurface again in the future.","Digital infrastructure builder CityFibre has today announced that they’ve reached a crucial UK funding agreement worth £2.3bn (mix of debt and equity). The deal will support the ongoing deployment of their new 10Gbps capable Fibre-to-the-Premises (FTTP) broadband network and also drive a new wave of consolidation.

Just to recap. CityFibre has already deployed their full fibre network to cover around 4.5 million premises (inc. 550k customers) and they’ve long aspired to reach up to 8 million UK premises – representing c.30% of the UK. But their original target of hitting that by the end of 2025 will be missed, and they’ve also been facing some of the same pressures as many other networks (e.g. high interest rates, rising build costs and competition).

NOTE: CityFibre is owned by Antin Infrastructure Partners, Goldman Sachs, Mubadala Investment Company, Interogo Holding etc. The network is supported by UK ISPs such as Vodafone, TalkTalk, Zen Internet, Sky Broadband and more, but they aren’t all live or available in every location yet.

In response, the operator has already made some redundancies and shifted their strategy, which sees them focus less on new network builds and more on growth via mergers and acquisitions (M&A), as reflected by the deals to acquire Connexin (here) and Lit Fibre (here). Not to mention putting more effort into commercialisation in order to encourage take-up by consumers, which is where the recent deal with Sky Broadband may help (here).

According to industry analyst James Ratzer – in 2025 and beyond, it’s expected that CityFibre will likely only build FTTP out to c.300k homes per annum organically, largely to meet their state aid backed Project Gigabit contracts. But the operator still aspires to add around 1 million premises each year, which suggests c.700,000 will be coming from the acquisition of other networks; something they’ve been very vocal about (here).

However, the operator’s existing funding had nearly run out, and they needed more in order to deliver on both their existing network expansion and their new consolidation strategy. Suffice to say that today’s agreement is aimed at tackling both of those issues.

What’s in the funding deal

The new financing includes £500m in new equity secured from CityFibre shareholders – Infrastructure at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Antin Infrastructure Partners, Mubadala Investment Company and Interogo Holding.

On top of that, CityFibre has also agreed a committed £960m expansion of its existing debt facilities, supported by lenders including ABN AMRO, BBVA, Crédit Agricole CIB, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo IMI CIB, Lloyds, the National Wealth Fund, NatWest, SEB and Société Générale. The facility will support their “continued network investment and enable it to rapidly connect hundreds of thousands of new customers“.

Finally, an accordion facility of £800m is also being made available to help drive CityFibre’s continued expansion through the acquisition of full fibre network assets. “This facility will be used to finance the company’s M&A pipeline and cement its position as the sector consolidator,” confirmed the announcement. This is a feature of loan agreements that allows them to increase, as required, the total amount of debt available under an existing facility.

Greg Mesch, CEO of CityFibre, said:

“This round of financing will supercharge CityFibre’s next phase of growth, as we consolidate the altnet sector, accelerate the pace of customer connections and unleash the full power of our market-leading 10Gb XGS-PON network, for the benefit of all our partners, their customers and for the UK economy.

There is huge opportunity ahead for CityFibre and it is testament to the success of the company that we have such strong backing from our lenders and shareholders. This multi-billion-pound investment into critical digital infrastructure will deliver significant benefits across the UK, helping to realise potential and unlocking economic growth.”

Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, said:

“Today’s announcement shows Britain is attracting billions of pounds of investment, including through the National Wealth Fund, driving growth across British businesses.

Investing in our digital infrastructure is key to ensuring our economy is fit for the future. Through our Plan for Change we’re growing the economy by boosting investment in Britain and working hand in hand with businesses to create jobs, to put more money in working people’s pockets.”

The risk in all this is that consolidating alternative networks tends to be a slow, complex and costly process – particularly with many altnets still holding an inflated idea of their own asset values. CityFibre’s strategy around this thus remains somewhat unproven, and any new funding deal they strike now will be subject to less favourable conditions than they had before (e.g. interest payments will be higher).

Put another way, this may not be the last funding deal they’ll need, which means that some of the same underlying funding challenges could still resurface again in the future. The operator also faces other challenges, such as from the recent instability at one of their largest ISP partners, TalkTalk, which currently accounts for c.150k customers via CityFibre and is struggling in ways that could risk wider harm in the future (here).",https://www.ispreview.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/nggallery_import/CityFibre-2025-van-on-suburban-road.webp,N,,2025-07-14 04:01:15.687816

“The strategies devised in boardrooms are outpaced by market improvements. It is essential to have an open and adaptive learning approach,” said Dev Tripathy, Head of Finance at Philips Indian Subcontinent, emphasising the role of purpose-driven leadership in economic growth.

Karun Jalali, Director at Deloitte India, pointed to the necessity of teaching the “art of unlearning and relearning,” while Wipro’s GM of HR, Praveen Kamath, remarked on the restlessness among young professionals. “Early boredom is catching up in India, even with the current demand for modern skillsets. The early career phase is crucial for gaining grit and acquiring new capabilities,” he said.

Technological adaptation also featured prominently in the discussion. “The advancement of technology is inevitable,” said Barclays MD Praveen Vukkalam, urging future managers to develop skills that endure beyond shifting tools. Suparna Banerjee Bhattacharyya, CFO at Schneider Electric Infrastructure, raised concerns over gender disparity in leadership, stating that cross-functional understanding is key to navigating leadership roles effectively. Meanwhile, Ranjan Mathur, partner at Ernst & Young, stressed the importance of combining empathy with data-driven decision-making.

The roundtable was moderated by Prof. Shubham Sharma, with faculty members including Prof. Vivek Roy, Prof. Kunal Ganguly, Prof. Utkarsh, and Prof. Deepak Verma contributing perspectives on how IIM Kashipur’s curriculum is being aligned with industry demands. They highlighted the institute’s focus on experiential learning, design thinking, and cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset.

The event concluded with a consensus among panellists that MBA graduates must be equipped not only with technical expertise but also with adaptive thinking and interpersonal skills to thrive in today’s volatile business environment.",https://static-bestcolleges.tosshub.com/2025/News/uabLythBaAUtqUde3ly3fETlmUtv9CTbhEdNhBzm.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 03:01:10.722731

The dust has settled on the 2025 Summer Black Friday, and the numbers are staggering: In just four days, US online spending hit $24.1 billion. Retailers recorded online sales growth of 30.3 percent. Reuters reported that 53.2 percent of orders came from mobile devices, with discounts averaging over 20 percent.

What's clear is this: America's consumer market is in the throes of a seismic shift. The e-commerce surge isn't just a symptom - it's the engine driving this transformation.

Beyond a mere pivot from brick-and-mortar to online, this represents a wholesale rewiring of consumer behavior, supply chains, retail models, and global trade dynamics. And at the heart of it? An ever-deepening connection with Chinese manufacturing.

Dig into the data, and ""Made in China"" emerges as the backbone of this boom. On Amazon, 70 percent of goods are Chinese-made. Walmart clocks in at 60 percent, while Target and Best Buy hover around 30 percent and 30-35 percent, respectively. From electronics to apparel to kitchen gadgets, the low-cost, high-quality output of Chinese factories is the linchpin of US retail giants' supply chains.

This isn't just about numbers - it's about an intricate web of interdependence. Despite corporate buzzwords like ""diversification,"" the reality is stark: China's role on critical product categories is unshakable. High-value, high-volume SKUs - think consumer electronics, clothing, and small appliances - are built on China's unmatched cost efficiency and production flexibility. Alternatives like US or Mexican manufacturing can't match the scale, speed, or price.

The consumer side tells the same story. America's trillion-dollar retail market, supercharged by post-pandemic online adoption, leans heavily on China's ability to churn out goods at breakneck speed to meet the demands of high-stakes sales events. Without China's manufacturing capability, retailers would buckle under the pressure of surging orders, competitive pricing, and tight logistics.

The US faces a stark choice: double down on a lose-lose trade war or preserve a mutually beneficial partnership, thereby advancing the transformation of American consumption. The time for decision is now, and the consequences of inaction could be dire.

If Trump-era tariffs make a comeback, the fallout will be brutal. First, inflation - already a sore spot - will spike, hammering a consumer market mid-transformation and dragging down the broader economy. Second, supply chains will fracture. Retailers have dabbled in sourcing from third countries, but the data doesn't lie: New products and restocks still hinge on Chinese factories, ports, and logistics networks. Shifting to other countries or domestic production isn't a quick fix - it's a three-to-five-year slog, at minimum. Third, as observers noted, tariffs will erode industry revenue and choke investment.

July's e-commerce explosion underscores a simple truth: The US and China are locked in a symbiotic dance. The world's biggest consumer market and its largest manufacturer aren't just linked - they're fused in a complex, interdependent relationship. Tariffs won't ""decouple"" this dynamic - they'll just unleash chaos in the short term and significant losses in the long term. The potential economic fallout is not to be underestimated.

History has shown that tariff wars are reckless, unpopular, and unsustainable. China's position is clear and firm: We do not want a trade war, but we are not afraid of one. Rational negotiation and a commitment to mutual gain are the only path forward. Washington should continue its efforts to translate the high-level agreement into concrete policies that sustain this e-commerce miracle. The importance of these negotiations and the achievement of win-win outcomes through them cannot be overemphasized.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2025/2025-07-13/c77d6e6c-7c83-4ca4-b1a8-621dae54e1d3.jpeg,N,,2025-07-14 07:08:52.813710

As Jury President for the Creative Business Transformation Lions category at this year’s Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Jane Lin-Baden, CEO Asia Pacific of Publicis Groupe, had a front-row seat to some of the world’s most compelling work. Leading a globally diverse jury of strategists, clients, and business and creative leaders, Lin-Baden oversaw entries that went far beyond traditional advertising to demonstrate how creativity is now central to how businesses operate, adapt, and grow.

“The Creative Business Transformation Lions category recognises the powerful impact of creativity on our clients' businesses,” Lin-Baden explained. “We looked for brilliant creative ideas that are core to business operations, where transformation not only delivers proven results but also shows the potential to scale in future.”

Creativity at the Core of Change

Under her leadership, the jury identified three overarching themes that characterised this year’s strongest entries.

The first was the evolution of purpose. While some brands still use purpose as an add-on to raise awareness for a cause, the most impressive work showcased purpose embedded into the operations of a company, driving both commercial and social value in a sustained way.

Second, there was a clear migration from ads to ecosystems. Lin-Baden noted that today’s most transformative creative ideas are no longer confined to marketing. “They impact everything from commercial models to supply chains, legal contracts, suppliers, patents, and stakeholders,” she said. “In other words, the entire ecosystem that supports products and services.”

Third, truly transformative brands are leading category reinvention. The most impactful ideas didn’t just help brands grow; they fundamentally redefined the playing field. By changing the rules, these brands reshaped entire categories and claimed leadership in doing so.

The work that particularly stood out from this year’s awards was the Grand Prix-winning campaign by AXA: ""Three Words"". The campaign added just three words to a home insurance policy, broadening the definition of household protection to include fire, flood, and even domestic violence. “By redefining the category, AXA now owns ‘household insurance’ , creating business and societal value,” said Lin-Baden.

But what truly impressed the jury was the campaign’s scale. The change was retroactively applied to 2.5 million existing contracts, involving legal, commercial, and operational shifts across AXA’s business. “It is a complete system overhaul that sets the benchmark for organisational change,” Lin-Baden said, noting the campaign’s direct contribution to sales growth and brand impact.

Another strong entry, Heineken’s “Backing the Bars”, demonstrated ecosystem-level thinking. The campaign supported bar owners and distributors - the stakeholders most essential to Heineken’s business. “The Jury appreciated the longevity of Heineken's support for its beer ecosystem,” said Lin-Baden. “Building bars is building Heineken.”

Suncorp’s “Building a More Resilient Australia” also left an indelible mark. Rooted in the brand’s purpose of helping customers prevent household damage from extreme weather, the campaign went beyond insurance to deliver real utility and resilience tools. “It brings value back to the business through increased market share, consideration uplifts, and customer lifetime value,” she noted. The jury was particularly impressed by the brand’s five-year commitment to these resilience initiatives.

While all Cannes Lions categories celebrate creativity, the Creative Business Transformation Lions category requires a higher bar: evidence of enduring business impact.

“Our jury asked whether we should reward proven results, or future potential or both,” Lin-Baden said. “The brands that achieve both deserve higher recognition.”

She also noted that not all longstanding brand platforms made the cut. “We saw some textbook examples that had long-term impact but hadn’t evolved with today’s social and political climate,” she explained. One successful example of evolution came from Cheetos, whose long-running “It’s a Cheetos Thing” platform continues to stay fresh and funny, embracing creativity and humour to remain culturally relevant.

Why business transformation is crucial

In Lin-Baden’s view, creative business transformation has never been more essential. “Agencies are playing a pivotal role in helping brands reshape how their business operates, engage customers and deliver business value,” she said. The days of one-off campaigns are fading. “The most impactful agencies are mobilising entire business ecosystems that are affecting everything from supply chains and legal contracts to company culture and stakeholders.”

She believes this shift reflects broader economic and social realities. “This year’s Cannes winners showed the expanding role of creativity in navigating change and solving business problems in a time of uncertainty.”

At Publicis Groupe, this belief in transformation is not theoretical, it is backed by significant investment. “We’ve invested hundreds of millions of euros into a suite of AI applications and agents, built specifically for marketing intelligence and transformation,” Lin-Baden shared.

At the heart of this ecosystem is CoreAI, a proprietary system that unifies Publicis’ consumer and business data. CoreAI allows trillions of data points to be shared across the Groupe and integrated directly into clients’ own business environments. “It brings our creative solutions even closer to their business outcomes,” she said.

Cultivating a culture of change

“Winning requires bravery,” says Lin-Baden. “I believe there is a creative solution for every universal problem we face today.”

For brands and agencies still hesitant to embrace transformation, her message is direct: “Staying still is no longer an option.”

She believes success comes to those willing to experiment on the road to meaningful change. “Clients are seeking insights, intelligence and creativity to make informed decisions in an increasingly shifting landscape. Agencies must innovate and commit to their clients' success.”

Publicis has continuously innovated though its Power of One model - a unified structure that removes silos across disciplines. “Media and creative capabilities are integrated with data and tech, social, CRM, influence, commerce and performance,” she said. This connected culture ensures a seamless, cross-functional approach to solving complex client problems.

She also highlighted the company’s investment in high-growth areas like influencer marketing, commerce, and social media. “These accelerators allow our teams to leverage data to drive transformation,” she explained.

But above all, Lin-Baden points to people as the true engine of transformation. “When we create a connected ecosystem for our people, they’re equipped with the mindset to grow all aspects of our clients' business.”

Looking ahead: creativity in an AI-induced world

As the industry embraces AI and automation, Lin-Baden is clear-eyed about its role: a powerful enabler and not a replacement.

“From the shortlist of Creative Business Transformation Lions contenders, there were only a few works that used AI,” she observed. “But we saw that AI can change how we evolve from ideas to implementation. The right AI prompt is a form of creativity in itself.”

She believes the ability to ask the right questions is becoming one of the most critical skills in marketing. “AI can enhance solutions with deeper analysis, but it cannot replace the creativity and collaboration between clients and agencies.”

As brands navigate a world of increasing complexity, creativity is no longer a ‘nice to have’, instead, it is the engine that powers business reinvention. This year’s Cannes Lions entries show that the most enduring brands are those that turn creativity from a message into a mechanism, one that rewires their systems, empowers their people, and engages their ecosystems. For Lin-Baden, this isn’t just the future of advertising. It’s the future of business.",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2fIMG_Opt1.JPG&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 03:01:37.532979

Most are said to be seeking a controlling stake in the coffee giant’s second-largest market, intensifying scrutiny over the future of Starbucks’ premium playbook in China.

While the Seattle-based chain has denied rumours of a full exit, it has confirmed it’s evaluating strategic options to Campaign Asia-Pacific.

“We see significant long-term potential in China and are evaluating the best ways to capture the future growth opportunities. We are looking for a strategic partner with like-minded values who shares our vision to provide a premium coffeehouse experience,” a spokesperson told Campaign Asia-Pacific. “We remain committed to China and want to retain a meaningful stake in the business. Any deal must make sense for Starbucks' business and partners.”

According to Chinese business outlet The 21st Century Business Herald, Starbucks may retain around 30% of its China unit, with the remainder potentially split among several investors to ensure that no single buyer holds a dominant share. The business is reportedly valued at around US$10 billion, according to a report in CNBC, with nearly 30 private equity firms expressing interest.

Centurium Capital’s name in the mix has raised eyebrows. The private equity firm, which now chairs Luckin Coffee under founder and CEO David Li, is reportedly among those submitting bids for the Starbucks China stake. If successful, it could mark an extraordinary twist in China’s coffee wars, where a backer of Starbucks’ fiercest competitor gains influence over the legacy brand’s local playbook.

Starbucks' struggles to keep pace with fast-growing, budget-friendly local competitors like Luckin are not new. After four consecutive quarters of sales decline in China, the Seattle-based coffee major saw flat growth in its latest quarter, prompting price cuts, menu localisation, and marketing refreshes, including tie-ins with pop culture brands. But the discounting move, a rare deviation from Starbucks’ premium playbook, sparked backlash on Chinese social media, with netizens criticising the cuts as too shallow to make an impact. The lowest-priced item on the menu now sits at RMB 23 yuan (US$3.20), still higher than most rivals.

Starbucks APAC CMO Samuel Fung stepped down earlier this year in February after a 12-year tenure with the coffee giant. Following this, China CMO Erin Silvoy left the region for a position in Seattle in April.

Starbucks entered China in 1999 and has since expanded to 7,685 stores in the market, according to its Q1 FY2025 results. Globally, the chain operates 40,576 outlets.

But its largest local rival, Luckin Coffee, is outpacing the American brand at breakneck speed. As of Q1, Luckin reported 24,032 stores across China and 65 globally, including new outlets in Singapore, Malaysia and most recently the US, where it opened two stores in New York City this July. The company’s high-volume, low-price strategy has proven effective in luring younger, value-conscious Chinese consumers.

While the deal process is still in early stages, shortlisted bidders are expected to gain access to internal financials as Starbucks weighs its next move. For now, the company insists any transaction must align with its long-term vision and values.",https://cdn.i.haymarketmedia.asia/?n=campaign-asia%2fcontent%2f20250714043707_Untitled+design+(13).jpg&h=630&w=1200&q=75&v=20250320&c=1,N,,2025-07-14 03:02:00.800584

This was as expectations around profitability deteriorated for the first time since last June, according to S&P Global. Firms expect to raise charges only modestly amid rising competition while managing their costs, including via further reductions in headcounts. That said, R&D spending was projected to continue rising to support sales, albeit at a reduced pace.

The net balance of Chinese firms that expect business activity to expand over the next year fell from 17 per cent in February to 11 per cent in June. This marked the lowest degree of confidence since June 2024 and was among the lowest on record. Additionally, optimism in China was below the global average of 24 per cent and the weakest of the BRICS nations, S&P Global said in its latest China Business Outlook survey.

Chinese business confidence weakened in June 2025, with the net balance for future output falling to 11 per cent—its lowest since June 2024. Firms expect modest price hikes amid rising competition and cost control through staff cuts. Profit outlook turned negative, and capex and R&D projections hit record lows. Despite challenges, growth is still expected, supported by government policies.

Business confidence among Chinese companies has weakened in June 2025, with both manufacturing and services sectors reporting a broad-based easing in positive sentiment. The manufacturing sector posted a net balance of 7 per cent, while services stood at 15 per cent, signalling moderation in expectations for future activity.

Key concerns include global trade policy uncertainty and a subdued economic environment, which companies believe will generate weak demand in the year ahead. Firms also cited intense market competition and rising input costs as major headwinds to growth. Despite this, businesses expect government support and improved financial conditions to aid performance, along with enhanced R&D efforts and a potential recovery in domestic demand.

Employment outlook has deteriorated significantly, with the net balance falling from −1 per cent in February to −3 per cent in June—marking the lowest level since February 2020. Both manufacturers (−3 per cent) and service providers (+3 per cent) expect staff reductions, indicating the first broad-based job shedding forecast in over five years.

Capital expenditure and R&D projections have also hit record lows. The net balance for anticipated capex fell to +2 per cent from +7 per cent in February, the lowest since comparable data began in October 2009. R&D intentions dropped to +5 per cent, the weakest since tracking started in February 2019, added the survey.

Cost pressures, however, are forecast to ease. Input and output prices are still expected to rise, but at slower rates. The net balance of firms expecting higher staffing costs stood at +5 per cent—its lowest since records began in 2019—while non-staff cost expectations fell to a nine-year low of +5 per cent. Selling price expectations have softened considerably, with only a net balance of +1 per cent planning price hikes, the lowest since February 2024.

Profit outlook has turned negative. With limited room to raise selling prices, the net balance for profitability dropped to −1 per cent in June from 5 per cent in February, the weakest reading since June 2024 and well below the global average of 8 per cent.

“A further loss of confidence was observed among Chinese firms at the end of the first half of 2025. Optimism regarding future output slipped to the lowest level since last June, with sentiment among manufacturers at a more subdued level compared to their services counterparts,” said Jingyi Pan, economics associate director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

“Despite expectations for slower cost increases, including via the management of salary outlays by reducing headcounts, Chinese businesses turned pessimistic regarding profitability in the year ahead. This reflected the challenges that companies anticipate regarding global trade and the ensuing impact on demand,” added Pan. “Overall, growth is still expected in the year ahead among Chinese firms as supportive policies and investment into new product launches are forecasted to drive sales. Even as firms planned to lower staffing levels, capital expenditure and R&D spending are reportedly set to continue growing, the latter at a rate that that remains above the global average.”

AI as democratizing force Ng argued that AI has the potential to empower small and medium-sized businesses, not just large enterprises.","CANNES – Epsilon is expanding its global reach and doubling down on predictive AI to help brands build more meaningful, measurable relationships with consumers, says Mike Ng, chief revenue officer of Publicis Groupe’s Epsilon.

Speaking with Jon Watts, managing director of the Coalition for Innovation in Media Measurement, at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, Ng described how identity, data, and AI are reshaping modern marketing.

“Something that Epsilon has done pretty well over the past five-plus years is really our truth set, our identity set from a U.S. perspective,” Ng said. “The reason why Lotame was so critical for us was it was our ability to bring our version of identity to the rest of the world.”

Epsilon recently acquired Lotame, a global data solutions provider, to accelerate its ability to unify identity data across markets like EMEA, APAC and Latin America.

“It’s not just a one-size-fits-all,” Ng said. “We make sure that we kind of evaluate the data set. That was part of the due diligence, part of the M&A process evaluating how identity is done by various companies, not just Lotame.”

Power of connected identity

For Epsilon, identity is the common thread that connects paid, owned, and earned marketing, and it is central to Publicis Groupe’s broader growth strategy.

“Connected identity is kind of the two-word phrase that we use both internally at Publicis and Epsilon, but also externally with our clients,” Ng said. “It’s really the thread that you pull between all forms of marketing.”

Ng explained that understanding consumers at the individual level enables brands to engage more effectively, whether through search, programmatic display, loyalty programs, or email campaigns.

“It’s really how do you know that individual horizontally as well,” he said.

Measurement, Ng emphasized, is what sets Epsilon apart.

“For us, having that measurability at that individual level, we do think differentiates us,” he said. “We do talk about the front and the back end as well.”

One view, one vision, one voice

Epsilon’s approach centers on providing marketers with a holistic understanding of their customers and orchestrating relevant messaging across channels.

“If you’re a financial services client, you might know a very, very deep depth of what your customers spend within that sector,” Ng explained. “But you may not know all the time demographic, zip code. You also may not know what CPG items you’re buying at the supermarket.”

That broader perspective, Ng said, is critical for delivering personalized marketing based on real consumer behavior and life stage. As an example, he shared his own experience shopping for a new television.

“The minute I buy the TV, I’m not looking to buy another TV right away. My wife would kill me,” Ng said. “But I might look at loyalty, I might look at a speaker system, I might look at a warranty.”

For Ng, true marketing harmony comes when brands stitch together the customer view, their purchase journey and real-time media activation.

“Stitching that all together is really where the magic happens,” he said. “It’s the identity and knowing when and where and how to address the consumer at the right place.”

Predictive AI, not just generative AI

While much of the marketing world focuses on flashy generative AI tools, Epsilon’s strength lies in predictive AI capabilities.

“We’re not really in the generative AI space, but we are in the predictive AI space,” Ng said. “It’s really around how do you find and predict the right individual, again around identity, and the right message, and the right context of when to find that person.”

Within Publicis Groupe, generative AI may play a role in creative development, but Ng emphasized that Epsilon complements that by applying predictive AI to improve targeting and message delivery.

“We marry that up on the predictive piece to then serve that and deliver that,” he said.

AI as democratizing force

Ng argued that AI has the potential to empower small and medium-sized businesses, not just large enterprises.

“I’m a big fan of how it democratizes it,” he said, pointing to AI’s role in making identity solutions more accessible. “It’s still first-party data that they own and they operate. How do you then utilize AI? It’s really the ideas that make the most difference.”

He predicted a shift in industry dynamics where creativity becomes an even greater differentiator.

“In the next 10 years, 20 years with AI, the ideas people might actually rise because AI is helping us build things faster,” Ng said. “We may, for the first time in the industry, have a shortage of ideas, not engineers.”

Retail media and the future of the market

Looking ahead to 2030, Ng expects retail media and commerce media to continue their rapid ascent, helping marketers diversify beyond dominant walled gardens.

“It’s almost what’s old is new, just like 90s fashion,” Ng said. “Audience, media identity, data monetization, these are things that happened in the 2000s, 2010s, 2020s went out of vogue, they’re now back in vogue with a different moniker.”

Retail media, Ng believes, represents an opportunity to democratize access to high-quality data and advertising solutions.

“I do hope that retail media kind of democratizes even the ability for more people to kind of fragment or shift budgets away, where it’s not so concentrated to some of the few walled gardens,” he said.

Ng closed the discussion with practical advice for marketers navigating complex technology ecosystems.

“There’s so much Frankensteining, there’s so much identity definition that’s different,” he said, warning against fragmented tech stacks that hinder interoperability. “The future next five years is interoperability of any partner that marketer would look at, because that’s how you actually measure the efficacy better.”

Otherwise, Ng cautioned, marketers risk getting lost in a sea of disconnected data points.

“There’s no unification there,” he said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/98069-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 04:00:58.031195

The bills would require third-party companies like Instacart and Shipt pay food delivery workers a minimum wage of $21.44 an hour or higher. That's the same rate restaurant delivery workers for apps like Uber Eats and DoorDash are currently paid.

The legislative package also includes making sure delivery workers get paid within seven days of the pay period ending, making sure customers have an opportunity to tip at least 10% before placing the order, and requiring companies pay workers when they log on, even if they aren't making deliveries.

Reactions mixed to grocery delivery worker bills

An Instacart delivery worker named Tommy M. said the bills are a start.

""It's still not enough, but I mean, it gives us hope,"" he said. ""It will be a pay increase, but it's not outrageous.""

Some shoppers outside a Key Food in Park Slope are in support of the bills.

""I think one of the things that's holding everything down is inequality, and so I would be all for it. I would be all for raising the minimum wage,"" shopper David Reed said.

Others worry increasing the minimum wage will increase grocery prices.

""I know it's going to. It's doing it already. Oh, definitely,"" shopper Susan Levy said.

Food delivery companies slam bills

Instacart and Shipt are both opposed to the bill.

An Instacart spokesperson said in a statement:

""It's simply unconscionable that the City Council is considering a bill that would jeopardize a lifeline thousands of New Yorkers rely on — particularly those facing health, mobility, or transportation challenges. The city's own data shows that this bill could drive grocery delivery costs up by a staggering 46%, cut off access to work for thousands of NYC delivery workers, and increase fees on local grocers.""

A spokesperson for Shipt said in a statement:

""We urge the Council to reconsider these bills before moving forward. These bills were developed without input from grocery delivery workers about their desire for flexibility and without acknowledgment of their distinct experiences working with platforms like Shipt. Passing these bills as drafted could lead to unintended consequences that hurt both the very workers they aim to protect and families that depend on grocery delivery.""

A spokesperson for Uber said the company would not be commenting on what he called the ""forced tipping bill.""

The company plans to build a textile factory and textile product (TPT) on an area of 8 hectares and is projected to absorb up to 8,000 workers.

The Ministry of Industry (Kemenperin) assesses that the investment in the TPT sector is a strategic step that will strengthen competitiveness in the midst of uncertain global economic conditions.

""This not only marks the start of physical development, but also the beginning of long-term cooperation which we hope will provide tangible benefits for investors, the government and local communities,"" said Deputy Minister of Industry (Wamenperin) Faisol Riza during the laying of the first stone of PT Xinhai Knitting Indonesia in Brebes, Central Java, recently.

Moreover, the TPT industry is one of the priority sectors in the roadmap for national industrial development. This sector is also the key to spurring Indonesia's economic growth. This can be seen from the performance in the first quarter of 2025, where the TPT industrial sector recorded positive growth of 4.64 percent.

Meanwhile, from the export side, for the period January to April 2025, the TPT industry recorded a value of 3.38 billion US dollars, an increase of 3.57 percent compared to the same period the previous year.

Currently, the TPT sector absorbs more than 3.76 million workers or about 19.18 percent of the total workforce in the national manufacturing sector.

A ground-breaking package of Bills passed in 2021 had set a minimum pay and addressed difficult working conditions for app-based food delivery workers, but only for those who delivered food from restaurants through apps such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats. The minimum rate was fully implemented from April 1, 2025.

The new legislation will require third-party app companies such as Instacart and Shipt to pay grocery delivery workers a minimum of US$21.44 (S$27.46) an hour to match the increase the food delivery workers received in April.

The Bills, five in total, will also mandate that the companies provide an option in their apps to give at least a 10 per cent tip, before or at the same time an order is placed, and that the companies must pay workers within seven days of the end of a pay period.

The delivery industry, which boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic, has continued to grow in New York City, with more than 100 million deliveries arranged through third-party apps. According to the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, there are an estimated 60,000 restaurant delivery workers in the city.

“It’s a huge milestone to make app delivery work more dignified, better paid and safer in our streets,” said Ms Ligia Guallpa, a co-founder of the Worker’s Justice Project, a worker centre that organises low-wage, immigrant workers.

Her group organises Los Deliveristas Unidos, an advocacy group for delivery workers.

Dr James Parrott, a senior fellow at the Centre for New York City Affairs at the New School, who consulted with the city on the delivery workers’ pay, said there needed to be more improvement in minimum pay standards.

But, he added, “we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that these pay standards for delivery workers in New York City are the best pay standards that exist in the United States”.

Mr Juan Felipe, 30, a grocery delivery worker, said he had cut back working for Instacart because he was making only about US$2 to US$7 an hour, and he did not plan on rushing back any time soon even if the legislation was passed.

“If we get that rate, that would be amazing,” he said. “But we’ll have to see what it’s going to be like.”

Mr Felipe said he often parks outside big-box retail store Costco in Queens, one of dozens of gig workers waiting for possible jobs to appear in their apps.

Council member Sandy Nurse, a Democrat who sponsored the grocery delivery workers Bill, said she had watched delivery companies evolve over the years at the expense of the workers.

“The apps are creating an environment that is unregulated, that doesn’t have a lot of worker protections,” Ms Nurse said. “Because a lot of these workers are immigrant workers, there’s just a lot of opportunity for exploitation.”

On July 12, Grubhub said in a statement that it was working with advocacy groups and the City Council “to make sure New York’s delivery workforce is protected without sacrificing the flexibility customers expect”.

Instacart said in a statement: “At a time when millions across the city are already struggling with rising costs for food and daily essentials, we urge the City Council to consider the real-world consequences this Bill could have on the families and communities that depend on grocery delivery the most.”

Uber and DoorDash did not reply to a request for comment.

In 2023, Grubhub, along with DoorDash and Uber Eats, filed requests for a temporary restraining order just days before an initial increase of the minimum wage for food delivery workers, to US$17.96 per hour, was to take effect. The requests contended that regulators used inaccurate data to calculate compensation.

A judge ruled against the three food delivery companies, allowing the city to raise the workers’ minimum wage to nearly US$18, and increase it further to US$20 or more in 2025.

The three companies had also filed a lawsuit in 2021, arguing that the city’s 15 per cent cap on fees charged to restaurants for online orders and 5 per cent cap for other fees was unconstitutional and prevented them from negotiating their own prices with restaurants.

The suit was settled in 2025 after the City Council made adjustments to the law that created some exceptions to the cap.

Although legislation would signify a victory for delivery workers, Council member Shaun Abreu, a Democrat and a sponsor of three Bills in the new package, said he had noticed forms of “retaliation” from third-party apps, like randomly deactivating workers’ accounts and removing the tipping option at checkout.

Mr Abreu said he planned to introduce legislation to prohibit the abrupt deactivation of delivery workers’ accounts by major third-party apps.

Mr William Medina, 37, who delivers for Uber Eats and is a member of Los Deliveristas Unidos, said he was very concerned about the “thousands” of delivery workers whose accounts had recently been deactivated.

“This is a very critical issue,” Mr Medina said. “We just need somebody, a real person who can mediate between the company and the worker on the deactivation process.” NYTIMES",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/554c2a35204da37279e95df54491658a20f554b21226cfe769924874d5514430,N,,2025-07-14 00:58:38.749266

Aldi plans to open 225 stores this year, a record for the chain, as part of a five-year strategy. Sprouts has plans for at least 35 new stores this year. Walmart opened its first new Neighborhood Market grocery store in three years in 2024 and its first Supercenter in four years in 2025.

All of this is putting further pressure on Kroger, the largest traditional supermarket operator in the U.S. by revenue — not including Walmart or Costco — according to Deloitte. The company currently lacks the direction of permanent leadership after its longtime CEO Rodney McMullen resigned in March after an investigation of personal conduct. The company is also working to cut costs, closing 60 underperforming stores, after spending more than $1 billion on its failed pursuit of competitor Albertsons. A Kroger spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Additionally, these retailers also beat Kroger in revenue growth, according to the NRF and Kantar’s annual list of the top 100 U.S. retailers by sales. Aldi grew 14% from 2023 to 2024, Sprouts grew 13%, H-E-B grew 7%, and Publix grew 5%, while Kroger grew 2%, per the report.

Erich Kahner, director of strategy and insights in the Americas for Dunnhumby, told Modern Retail that, because of improvements in the consumer and economic environment since the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, grocers now may be more willing to make longer-term bets on expanding their private labels, growing their store count or making acquisitions.

“Compared to the last five years, the past 12 months have been relatively unique in the sense that customers haven’t faced a ton of disruption in their monthly budgets, unemployment has been pretty steady, interest rates have been creeping back down and inflation has been relatively normal,” Kahner said.

‘A key battleground’ for Kroger

A Dunnhumby study measuring both customer perception and financial data found H-E-B to be the No. 1 grocery store in the U.S. in 2024, the fourth time within eight years. Kroger ranked No. 17.

“Given the strength of H-E-B in Texas, I think that’s a key battleground for Kroger that represents the challenge they face in a lot of their frontier markets,” being markets outside of its home region of the Midwest, Kahner said.

He added that the further away grocers get from their home markets, the share of customer grocery budgets they are able to capture erodes. The average Kroger customer in Cincinnati gives about 50% of their grocery budget to Kroger, according to Kahner, based on his firm’s data (which is based on the consumer perception study as well as Placer.ai foot traffic data from cell phones), and in Dallas, it’s 30% of their grocery budget. In Louisville, Publix gets about 20% of the average shopper’s grocery budget, but 40% in Orlando.

Kroger has been in Texas since the ’50s, but Kahner believes its market share is at risk, given H-E-B’s strong perception throughout Texas.

“Each Kroger location only has one or two H-E-Bs [in the Dallas area] to go up against, but we would expect H-E-B to continue to densify in Dallas until that number is more like four or five locations that each Kroger is going up against,” he said.

Kroger versus Publix

On the Publix front, Kahner pointed to Louisville as a model of what could happen in Cincinnati. Louisville saw its first Publix store open in 2024, and already, that store is drawing shoppers from 15 of Kroger’s 25 Louisville locations, based on the firm’s shopper data. “That Publix is definitely a threat to Kroger – just that single Publix alone.”

Dunnhumby found Kroger’s strength lies in its loyalty and personalization capabilities digitally, while H-E-B has the upper hand on private brand quality and its local community connection and, Publix wins on assortment and store experience. Kroger has still improved over the past four or five years, Kahner said.

“Kroger has actually been on an upward journey in the strength of its overall brand equity with customers,” Kahner said. “They haven’t always been in our top quartile; they’ve snuck in the top quartile the last couple of years.”

Ross Cloyd, grocery analyst for Kantar, said he has personally seen changes in Kroger’s merchandising, assortment and store experience from market to market, based on which competitors are nearby. He said he noticed in Georgia that Kroger would have signs in its stores detailing at which local farms and farmers the produce came from, similar to messaging created by Publix. Additionally, in Texas he noticed “Texas proud” signage and dedicated local sections that would remind him of H-E-B — neither of which he would see in his home state of Indiana.",https://www.modernretail.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/20231024_HEBManvelVIPOpen033.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 06:06:09.807671

A Capgemini Research Institute report, Future encrypted: Why post-quantum cryptography tops the new cybersecurity agenda, highlights that rapid progress of quantum computing threatens to render current encryption algorithms obsolete. ‘Harvest-now, decrypt-later’³ attacks, together with tightening regulations and the evolving technology landscape, have elevated the importance of quantum safety.

However, despite increasing awareness within the industry, many organizations still underestimate the risks surrounding quantum computing, which could lead to future data breaches and regulatory penalties.

According to the report, around two-thirds (65%) of organizations are concerned about the rise of ‘harvest-now, decrypt-later’ attacks. One in six early adopters believe that ‘Q-day’ will be within five years, while around six in ten believe it will arrive within a decade.

Marco Pereira, Global Head of Cybersecurity, Cloud Infrastructure Services at Capgemini, said, “Quantum readiness isn’t about predicting a date–it’s about managing irreversible risk. Every encrypted asset today could become tomorrow’s breach if organizations delay adopting post-quantum protections. Transitioning early ensures business continuity, regulatory alignment, and long-term trust.

“Quantum safety is not a discretionary spend but a strategic investment, which can turn a looming risk into a competitive advantage. The organizations that recognize this fact early will best insulate themselves against future cyber-attacks,” Pereira said.

While current quantum computers cannot break widely used encryption yet, high-risk industries such as defense and banking are leading the adoption of quantum-safe solutions. In contrast, consumer-focused sectors like consumer products and retail sectors are showing less urgency.

Post-quantum cryptography migration preferred over other quantum-security solutions

Most organizations surveyed (70%) are protecting their systems against emerging quantum threats by adopting the appropriate mix of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms.

They view PQC as the best option to address near-term quantum security risks because it provides a comprehensive approach to securing data. Nearly half of early adopters are already exploring, assessing feasibility, or piloting PQC solutions. For 70% of organizations, regulatory mandates are a key driver behind the shift to PQC.

While the early adopters are working towards quantum safety, a few organizations (30%) are still ignoring the quantum threat. They are struggling to allocate sufficient budget and personnel to cryptographic transition.

Report Methodology: The Capgemini Research Institute conducted a survey of 1,000 organizations with annual revenue of at least $1 billion across 13 sectors and 13 countries in Asia–Pacific, Europe, and North America. The global survey was carried out in April–May 2025. Around 70% of the sample in this report are referred to as ‘early adopters’.

Taco Bell is following McDonald's leads in several key ways, NRN reports. McDonald's launched its McValue menu (RIP OG Dollar Menu), and Taco Bell launched its customizable Luxe Boxes. McDonald's announced its beverage-focuses CosMc's concept, and Taco Bell announced its Live Más Café. When McDonald's brought back its famed Snack Wraps, Taco Bell discounted its closest offerings, its new Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos. In fact, crispy chicken is key to the Bell's strategy.

The ""Mexican"" chain first embraced crispy chicken in April, adding nuggets to its menu after a hugely successful limited run a few months prior, per Fox Business. ""The demand for our nuggets was off the charts,"" the company's Chief Marketing Officer Taylor Montgomery said, ""which is why we’re looking at making crispy chicken permanent...""

In June, they added the Crispy Chicken Tacos and Burritos. Although these items will only be available for a limited time, the company promises crispy chicken will become a mainstay on the menu come 2026. ""The craving for crispy chicken is growing every single day and our fans told us loud and clear: give us more,"" food innovation exec Liz Matthews said in a Taco Bell press release. Montgomery added, ""Crispy chicken is having a moment.""",https://parade.com/.image/t_share/ODowMDAwMDAwMDAwODc3Mjg3/sign-for-fast-food-brand-taco-bell.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 02:03:26.239452

FashionNetwork.com: How strong is LVMH in Italy?

Toni Belloni: The group has six Italian houses ( , , Pucci, Loro Piana, and Cova cafés, editor's note). It has 280 boutiques and 66 production workshops, employing more than 18,000 people in the country, while employing nearly 100,000 others through its network of more than 4,000 suppliers and subcontractors. The Italian ecosystem offers a particularly favorable context for the development of luxury brands.

FNW: LVMH invested heavily in Italy last year. Will it continue to do so?

TB: In 2024, we invested around 500 million euros in Italy, as a large number of projects came to fruition over the same period. Previously, we were investing more like 100 million euros, so I don't think we'll be deploying that kind of money again. But it does testify to the fact that the Group is continuing to commit to new, and even major, investments.

FNW: What are LVMH's current projects in Italy?

TB: For 2026, a new workshop dedicated to accessories will be built ex novo in Pontassieve, Tuscany. There's also Loro Piana's major project at Ghemme, in the cashmere district near Novara in Piedmont, which will set up an industrial complex around a historic building, bringing together under one roof its various workshops currently scattered around the valley, as well as other activities. We are also renovating a number of Belmond Group hotels, including the Hotel Cipriani in Venice. In Milan, the three flagships of Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co. were opened on Via Montenapoleone, followed by the three new openings on the same street of Fendi, and .

FNW: In view of the economic situation, have you reviewed certain investments?

TB: Investment projects are medium-term, and cannot be stopped or restarted from one day to the next. At the very least, we can delay the opening of a store for a few months, or postpone certain investments for the long term, but I think that the strategic commitment is to invest. First of all, on the store front. This year, we plan to open at least five of the six major stores I mentioned in Milan. But also in the supply chain, which I think still needs to be strengthened culturally in terms of training, but also from an infrastructure point of view.

FNW: Have any of the planned investments been postponed?

TB: Our strategic horizon, whether in the retail or industrial sectors, is three to five years. So we have to realize that we're betting on a market that will continue to grow in the medium to long term, while we're more cautious about the next six or even nine months. Clearly, we're not in a glorious market phase. But, as a reminder, the current situation follows a period of almost thirty months, from 2021 to mid-2023, of euphoric growth, which frankly was not sustainable.

""Consistent with the above comments of the Review Panel, now that the FWC has issued its decision in the SDA v McDonald's case, the scope of the supported bargaining laws needs to be reconsidered.
""We always warned from the time leading up to the September 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit that the implementation of radical changes to bargaining laws would be a 'slow burn'.
""The bargaining claim comes on the back of a separate SDA proposal to curtail the capacity of retail and fast food businesses to engage junior employees on discounted rates.
""Employers in the fast food industry, such as McDonald's, are proud to offer thousands of young workers their first employment opportunity but they aren't a magic pudding that can accommodate dramatic cost increases.","""The Fair Work Commission's recent controversial decision to issue a supported bargaining authorisation requiring McDonald's franchisees in South Australia to enter into multi-party bargaining arrangements has undoubtedly emboldened the SDA to bargain for a multi-employer agreement across all McDonald's restaurants,"" said Innes Willox, Chief Executive of the national employer association Australian Industry Group.

""The SDA application represents a dramatic and sadly inevitable escalation of the Government's multi-bargaining laws across the economy, well beyond what the Government suggested would occur when it pushed through the laws in late 2022. Employer warnings at the time of economy-wide implications of the laws on jobs, costs, business confidence and investment are now unfortunately coming to pass.

""An application seeking to cover all McDonald's restaurants will impact hundreds of franchisees who are separate employers. Bargaining across such a broad range of businesses will undoubtedly be very complex and costly if authorised by the Fair Work Commission.

""As we have previously warned, there is now a clear risk that thousands of employers in the fast food, retail, hospitality and many other sectors, will be dragged into multi-employer bargaining by unions against their will and without the support of the majority of their employees. This includes many small businesses that are struggling to survive in the current difficult trading environment.

""The union-friendly supported bargaining stream was intended to operate in sectors where the employers and employees need a lot of support to bargain, typically because of the Government-funded nature of those sectors.

""There is a real risk that this stream now operates as an unfair mechanism for unions to seek to evade safeguards in the existing bargaining stream that generally require unions to demonstrate that a workforce wants them to bargain with their employers before a business can be forced into bargaining with them.

""Many hundreds of enterprise agreements have been made in the fast food industry and there is no reason why the main enterprise bargaining laws should not apply, including the requirement for a union to establish that the majority of employees support the negotiation of an enterprise agreement.

""In the context of McDonald's there are also real questions about whether the SDA actually represents many employees working in the chain of restaurants, let alone whether the majority of workers who will be impacted by the union bargaining claims support their application.

""Australian Industry Group urges the Federal Government to introduce urgent amendments to the Fair Work Act to tighten up the scope of the supported bargaining stream, and to address the unintended consequences reflected in the FWC's decision.

""The recent Draft Report of the Review Panel that considered whether the bargaining laws were operating as intended, contains the following relevant comments:

'The Review Panel acknowledges that the ongoing matter in relation to McDonald's franchises in South Australia may, in future, require further consideration about the intended scope of the supported bargaining stream. However, until such time as the FWC has considered the evidence in that matter, it is premature to consider further changes.'

""Consistent with the above comments of the Review Panel, now that the FWC has issued its decision in the SDA v McDonald's case, the scope of the supported bargaining laws needs to be reconsidered.

""We always warned from the time leading up to the September 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit that the implementation of radical changes to bargaining laws would be a 'slow burn'. The implications and risk of the amendments are now clearly being demonstrated.

""The bargaining claim comes on the back of a separate SDA proposal to curtail the capacity of retail and fast food businesses to engage junior employees on discounted rates.

""Ultimately, there is a very real risk that unsustainable unions claims, pushed by the SDA through either bargaining or their award case, will undermine the viability of employers in the fast food industry continuing their model of offering employment opportunities to young workers.

""Employers in the fast food industry, such as McDonald's, are proud to offer thousands of young workers their first employment opportunity but they aren't a magic pudding that can accommodate dramatic cost increases. They operate in a highly competitive and cost-sensitive environment.

""Expert evidence advanced in the Award case by Australian Industry Group shows that the SDA's wage claim in the proceedings will cause thousands of young workers to lose their jobs. Efforts to achieve the same increases through bargaining would have similar impacts.

""The SDA seems determined to attack employment opportunities for young people in the fast food and retail sectors, despite there being few other sectors that offer a pathway into employment for these workers. It is a sad day when it is obvious that union claims will potentially deny employment opportunities to thousands of young Australians wanting to get their foot on the job ladder,"" Mr Willox said.",https://www.aigroup.com.au/globalassets/images/aigroup-og-standard.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 02:03:31.760078

Hybrid work could potentially improve productivity, reduce employee turnover, and lower business costs like real estate for as much as 55% according to a survey by the International Workplace Group (IWG) and global engineering consultancy Arup.

Citing a US-modelled survey, the study revealed that hybrid working could generate $282b in Gross Value Added (GVA) annually by 2030 and $729b by 2045, through increased productivity, reduced turnover, lower replacement costs, and portfolio savings.

Productivity could also improve by 11% driven by lower commutes, with employees benefiting from increased focus time and fewer distractions, ultimately spending up to 40% of time saved from travelling on additional work. In fact, the rate of employees reporting their productivity levels as ‘excellent’ in flexible workspaces is 67% higher than those working from home.

The report estimates that this could unlock $54.4b in annual GVA within five years, rising to $140.3b by 2045.

In a previous IWG study, 77% of Gen Z workers in Singapore reported higher job satisfaction under a hybrid model, with 34% saying their work-life balance improved.

IWG estimates that employees working closer to home can save up to $39,400 annually by avoiding daily commutes.

Why Cindy Rose?
All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.
In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft.
This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.","On Thursday this week, British advertising giant WPP announced that it will appoint board member Cindy Rose as the new Chief Executive Officer. According to the relevant announcement, the new CEO will officially take office on September 1st, which means that Mark Read, the current CEO of WPP, will leave his position four months earlier than originally planned.

Notably, one day before the announcement, WPP released an unscheduled financial report update, significantly lowering its full - year performance forecast, which caused the stock price to plummet by 18.09% in a single day, the largest single - day decline since 2020. This is likely to make people have some associations - Mark Read is most likely to be held accountable for WPP's declining performance.

After all, 2025 can almost be said to be a year when WPP's performance suffered an unprecedented setback. First, in March this year, WPP lost Coca - Cola's North American media business. Subsequently, Paramount also announced the end of its 20 - year partnership with WPP. In June this year, Mars, the fast - moving consumer goods giant, also chose to transfer its $1.7 billion advertising business covering more than 70 different markets around the world to Publicis Groupe.

This means that in just one year, WPP has lost several long - term giant clients. This is obviously not a good sign. After all, most brands do not change their agents frequently, which means that WPP may not be able to regain these lost orders for at least the next 3 - 5 years.

In addition to the lost clients, the competitive pressure WPP faces is also increasing. Even if we don't mention the digital advertising sector that has been continuously squeezed by various Internet companies, in the traditional agency field, with the completion of the merger of Omnicom and IPG, WPP will obviously face more challenges in the second half of the year.

At this time, the only good news may be that with WPP's announcement of a leadership change, WPP's stock price immediately rebounded in the short term, rising 3.58% to $30.39 in pre - market trading. This relatively positive signal seems to indicate that the market views this appointment as a relatively positive sign. Of course, from a pessimistic perspective, it may also be that the market believes that WPP's current dilemma has reached its limit, and as long as there is a change, it may be a good thing.

So, who exactly is WPP's new CEO? Why does WPP's board of directors believe that Cindy Rose will be the key leader to pull WPP out of the mire?

Why Cindy Rose?

All the information about Cindy Rose can actually be summarized in one sentence - she is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds.

In fact, looking at Cindy Rose's entire work experience, we will find that her career path is very different from that of the current CEOs of other 4A groups. Whether it is Arthur Sadoun, the CEO of Publicis Groupe, or John Wren, the CEO of Omnicom Group, they almost all worked in advertising companies before joining their respective groups. Hiroshi Igarashi, the current CEO of Dentsu, has been working at Dentsu since graduation and took over as CEO in 2017.

In contrast, Cindy Rose's work experience is almost entirely cross - industry. After joining Disney in 1995, she spent 15 years working her way up to the senior vice - president of the Interactive Media Group in the EMEA region (a combination of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa). In 2010, she joined Virgin Media in the UK and promoted the innovative model of bundling broadband and TV services. Then in 2014, she joined Vodafone, an old rival of Virgin and one of the world's largest mobile communication companies, to be responsible for the transformation of its mobile communication business. In 2016, she joined Microsoft as the president of Western Europe and the CEO of the UK, and in 2023, she became the chief operating officer of its global enterprise business, leading the digital transformation strategy in the European market.

If we analyze further, we will find that whether it is Disney, Vodafone, or Microsoft, these companies seem to be ""digital industrial companies"" in their respective fields. Disney can be said to be the first traditional film and television company to accept and try the streaming media business. Vodafone has the world's most complete enterprise information management system and customer service system. In fact, many people believe that this is the key for Vodafone to maintain its strong competitiveness.

Microsoft is even more of Cindy Rose's career peak. If we organize the relevant information, we will find that from 2020 to 2023, in just three years, Cindy Rose promoted the implementation of the ""cloud - first"" strategy in 17 Western European countries at the strategic level, increasing the market share of Azure cloud services in this region by 8 percentage points in three years. She also established Microsoft's first industrial AI R & D center in Munich.

In 2023, after Cindy Rose took office as the chief operating officer, she began to further promote the organizational structure reform of Microsoft. On the one hand, she designed a new operating model called ""Customer Success Units"", restructured the global enterprise customer service team into 12 industry vertical units, and promoted the in - depth integration of the sales and technology teams, shortening the solution delivery cycle by 30%. She also participated in optimizing the product roadmap of Azure Stack HCI and designing the architecture of the multi - cloud management solution.

As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said when evaluating her - ""Cindy Rose successfully brought Microsoft's global enterprise business into a new AI - driven stage.""

This is why we say that Cindy Rose is a new leader with rich ""transformation"" and ""technology"" backgrounds. So, is this new CEO really suitable for WPP at present? Or why has she become the ""savior"" in the eyes of WPP's board of directors, and why are they so eager to have her become the new captain of WPP, this advertising giant?

Is WPP in a Mess?

Obviously, WPP's current dilemma is exactly the type that Cindy Rose is good at. But to explain this in detail, we need to go back to an earlier time.

In 2018, Martin Sorrell, the founder of WPP, left the advertising empire he built. Mark Read became the second captain of WPP. However, the advertising group he faced at that time was not an aggressive and united one. On the contrary, due to Sorrell's radical merger and expansion strategy in his era, WPP at that time was a huge organization formed through capital integration and mergers, with more than 400 agencies covering multiple marketing fields such as advertising creativity, media placement, public relations, and market research, in different regions and sub - fields.

This made the recognition of the group brand even lower than that of its well - known agencies in many cases. A current executive of WPP once told the American financial media ""Business Insider"": ""WPP has long been regarded as an investment tool aimed at acquiring agencies and rewarding shareholders. To put it bluntly, it has a rather 'dispersed and chaotic' atmosphere.""

Of course, in Sorrell's era, this chaos did not really affect the company's performance. After all, at that time, the clients were also in a state of disunity. Different clients in different industries and fields had almost completely different ideas, which meant that for WPP at that time, even if it could integrate different agencies into a perfect whole, it was still difficult to form effective synergy.

However, with the increasing popularity of digital marketing, especially the rapid maturity of discriminative AI, data - driven digital marketing has gradually become the most important channel in the marketing industry. At this stage, as Internet companies began to build their own walled gardens through data, WPP's traditional decentralized model made it difficult for the group to fully integrate the data and technical capabilities of different agencies. Not to mention the low efficiency in communication and collaboration caused by this traditional decentralized structure.

As the global CMO of Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser, once complained at the American Advertisers Conference:

""Too much management, high rent, and indirect costs of many advertising groups make advertisers feel overwhelmed. The business of agencies has become more complex, with layers of account managers to convey information, resulting in advertising companies no longer focusing on creativity, and spending too much time on phone conferences, off - site activities, business trips, and PPT presentations.""

And this was exactly when Mark Read officially took the helm of WPP in 2018. Perhaps Sorrell realized that he could no longer drive WPP, the world's largest advertising group at that time, into deeper waters with old methods in the new era, so Read became the new captain.

From today's perspective, the strategic approach Read formulated at that time did conform to the direction of market evolution. On the one hand, he promoted in - depth integration within the company, proposing ""One Company, Not a Group"", and merged many well - known agencies except Ogilvy to some extent. He even sold the equity of some agencies and non - core businesses.

In 2025, he restructured the media agency brand GroupM into a unified entity called ""WPP Media"", laid off up to 40% - 45% of the staff, and brought media subsidiaries such as Mindshare and Wavemaker under unified management. At the same time, he began to acquire a large number of technology companies and made heavy investments in the AI field, investing nearly £300 million per day. He built a self - developed intelligent marketing operating system called WPP Open, which integrates the full - link capabilities of creative production, media placement, and data analysis and embeds generative AI tools.

As for the final effect, opinions vary. Many current and former employees of WPP have complained about Read's decision to discontinue many well - known creative brands. For example, in November 2018, Wunderman and JWT (J. Walter Thompson) merged, and the JWT brand became history.

A former employee of Ogilvy told Morketing: ""This move is as ridiculous as deleting Lincoln from American history.""

However, there are also positive aspects. As the most heavily invested intelligent marketing operating system in WPP's history, by March 2025, WPP Open could cover 48,000 employees (60% of the customer service team), generate 130,000 personalized advertisements for Cadbury's Indian market, reach 94 million people, and reduce costs by 90%.

However, Read still failed to solve the old problems of organizational bloating and cumbersome processes caused by WPP's years of mergers. But the era has once again reached a new crossroads. The era of artificial intelligence is just around the corner, and the confrontation between technology giants and advertising groups has reached a critical moment. As a person with rich experience in technology giants and corporate transformation, Cindy Rose, just like Mark Read when he took over the helm from Martin Sorrell in 2018, has become the new helmsman of this huge ship.

And the problems WPP is facing now are exactly what she is good at, just like the work she did during her tenure as the chief operating officer at Microsoft - through organizational structure reform, deeply integrating the sales, technology (and now creativity) teams, and shortening the entire advertising production and delivery cycle. At the same time, truly commercializing AI and integrating it into the group's processes.

Her experience is a key asset that WPP Group urgently needs to cope with industry changes.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250712/v2_50cee8dd35674dea8d0f4e7585adb984@000000@ai_oswg387546oswg1536oswg722_img_000~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-07-14 00:00:53.082222

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.
Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J.
“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.","New York: Kraft Heinz Co is looking to spin off a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity that could be valued at as much as US$20bil on its own, the Wall Street Journal reports.

This would leave the company with products such as its namesake Heinz ketchup and Dijon mustard brand Grey Poupon, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

News of the potential move was the second effort last week by a storied US company looking to shore up shareholder value as shoppers ditch their pricey products in an uncertain economy.

Earlier last week, cereal maker WK Kellogg agreed to a US$3.1bil buyout deal from Italy’s Ferrero.

“As announced in May, Kraft Heinz has been evaluating potential strategic transactions to unlock shareholder value,” a company spokesperson said.

The company’s shares closed up 2.5%. It currently has a market value of US$31.33bil.

Kraft Heinz was formed in 2015 after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital combined the former Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz, which they bought in 2013. But it has been a challenging investment for Berkshire.

Inflationary pressures and a shift in focus toward fresher, less processed food have hurt demand for the company’s lunch combos and other products.

It lowered annual forecasts and reported a dour quarter in April, hurt by muted consumer spending.

Kraft Heinz also said last month it would stop the launch of new products with artificial colours in the United States after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr outlined plans to remove synthetic food dyes from the US food supply to address chronic diseases and conditions.

According to the Wall Street Journal report last Friday, a split could be finalised in the coming weeks, but Kraft Heinz has discussed other scenarios with its advisers and its board has not signed off on a final decision.

The company is also working on which brands would be part of the spun-off entity, the report said.

“Kraft Heinz spinning off its grocery business echoes the 2023 Kellogg spin-off in which the company spun off its cereal business, which had been in volumetric decline for some time,” said Connor Rattigan, analyst at Consumer Edge.

“As consumer packaged goods makers (CPGs) contend with both changing consumer preferences and a challenging consumer environment, other CPGs may look to mergers and acquisitions and or similar corporate actions to improve their category exposures and improve their top-line trajectory,” Rattigan said. — Reuters",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/07/14/3415065.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:26.271879

NEEDHAM, Mass– PC shipments during the second quarter of 2025 grew 6.5% from the prior year, with global volumes reaching 68.4 million shipments, according to preliminary results from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Personal Computing Device Tracker.

Despite PC market growth in other geographies, the US market is starting to feel the pinch of import tariffs.

“We expected the US market to cool down this quarter given the inventory buildup to begin the year, but what we’re witnessing here might highlight US PC demand slowing down in anticipation of the import tariffs looming deadline,” said Jean Philippe Bouchard, research vice-president with IDC’s Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers. “Despite a flat US PC market, the rest of the world demonstrated an appetite for PCs, fueled by an aging installed base and by a steady transition to Windows 11.”

“We realize growth in such an indeterminate market seems odd, but many factors come into play supporting the momentum,” said Ryan Reith, group vice president with IDC’s Worldwide Device Trackers. “The supply side of the industry is doing its best to navigate the unknowns as no one wants to sit on their heels and potentially miss an opportunity, but at the same time it is very risky carrying inventory which is a possibility given the strong first half sell-in. The bigger concern is what overall demand looks like as we get late into Q3 and beyond. Price increases will likely be dispersed over time and geography depending on vendor strategy which can potentially lead to some attractive promotions as a way to clear inventory backups, which seems odd at a time when prices are expected to rise because of tariffs.”

Quartr reports that, in 2023, the stored value of Starbucks cards sat at a whopping $1.6 billion.
So, it's safe to say that, much like the popular practice of customizing your drink order, Starbucks is a big fan of gift card purchases, because all that unspent Starbucks card money is like a loan that the company doesn't have to pay interest on.

The Starbucks mobile app has been around for over 15 years now, and it's seen some massive changes.","For a seasoned coffee drinker, a Starbucks gift card is not only thoughtful, it's practical, too. Getting one of those coveted cards from a friend, a job, or even buying one for yourself can come in handy during a caffeine crisis. But for Starbucks, selling credit for its coffee and other offerings ahead of time is big business. We're talking billion-dollar business, because that's what customers routinely leave on their cards at any given time.

Quartr reports that, in 2023, the stored value of Starbucks cards sat at a whopping $1.6 billion. This includes both physical and digital cards, which are stored on the mobile app. So, it's safe to say that, much like the popular practice of customizing your drink order, Starbucks is a big fan of gift card purchases, because all that unspent Starbucks card money is like a loan that the company doesn't have to pay interest on.

The Starbucks Q4 2024 fiscal report put the stored card value at $1.78 billion at the end of 2024, which means that the amount of money held on Starbucks cards has continued to increase every year except for a slight dip in 2019 and 2020 (per Quartr). To put this into perspective, that's enough money on Starbucks cards to buy every single person in the U.S. an Iced Tall Cinnamon Dolce Latte, though they'd have to cover their own tax.

Much of the Starbucks stored card value is actually the balance that customers keep on the mobile card on the app. That way, even if they don't have cash or available money on a debit card, they can still get that coffee fix. The Starbucks mobile app has been around for over 15 years now, and it's seen some massive changes. When it first started, the app could tell customers about store locations, the Starbucks menu, and had a drink builder to assist with ordering. Now, it serves as a mobile Starbucks card that you can use to pay for drinks in the app or in the store. It also tracks Starbucks Rewards that are earned when making purchases.

You can add physical gift cards to the app, too, so that even if the card gets lost, the cash on it doesn't. While it's hard to say how much of Starbucks' stored card value comes from the mobile app, CNN Business reports that 70% of the coffee company's sales come through the mobile app and drive-thru. We can definitely see why using the app to order drinks and other items from Starbucks is so popular. Using the right tips and hacks can lead to more Reward points, which then leads to discounts and even free items.",https://www.tastingtable.com/img/gallery/the-incredible-amount-of-unspent-starbucks-gift-cards-people-are-hanging-on-to/l-intro-1752081002.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:44.163329

The document showcases the Group’s continued evolution of a sustainability-centered management strategy, highlighting measurable achievements across environmental, social, and governance (ESG) dimensions.

The report outlines comprehensive progress across key areas, including a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, expanded use of renewable energy, increased adoption of certified materials, enhanced product authentication through blockchain technology, and impactful initiatives in human capital and community engagement.

31% Emissions Reduction and 100% Renewable Energy in Europe and North America

On the environmental front, OTB reported a 31% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) compared to 2023. In addition, all directly managed sites in Europe and North America—including offices and stores—achieved 100% renewable energy usage. Globally, the share of renewable energy reached 70%, and the Group’s emissions reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a global standard for climate action in business.

Expanding the Use of Certified and Low-Impact Materials

Progress was also evident in sustainable sourcing. In 2024, 24% of all raw materials purchased by OTB were certified. Notably, preferred cotton—organic, regenerative, and recycled—accounted for 62% of total cotton use, marking a 31% increase from the previous year. This shift reflects a Group-wide commitment to circularity, transparency, and responsible design embedded across its brand portfolios.

Blockchain-Based Authentication and Anti-Counterfeiting Efforts

OTB has also advanced in its technological initiatives. As a Steering Member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium alongside LVMH, the Prada Group, and Cartier (Richemont), OTB issued over 1.8 million digital certificates of authenticity between 2022 and 2024 for products from Jil Sander, Maison Margiela, and Marni. These certificates allow customers to verify product authenticity and trace origins via smartphone.

In parallel, the Group intensified efforts to combat counterfeiting. In 2024 alone, more than 23,000 illicit pieces of content were removed from social media, and over 60,000 counterfeit listings for its brands were taken down from online marketplaces.

Diesel’s Circularity Strategy Earns International Recognition

Diesel continues to lead the charge in circular fashion. Its initiatives—including Diesel Rehab Denim and Diesel Second Hand—along with a recycling collaboration involving its supply chain and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), earned the brand the Circular Economy Award from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation during the 2024 Sustainable Fashion Awards hosted by the National Chamber for Italian Fashion.

Gender Equity, Talent Development, and Corporate Volunteering

OTB’s investment in human capital remains central to its strategy. In 2024, the share of women in managerial roles reached 54.7%, enabling the Group to renew its gender equality certification. Meanwhile, the internal training program “Scuola dei Mestieri” continued to support the next generation of Made in Italy artisans, with over 85% of participants hired by OTB companies.

The newly launched “Brave to Care” corporate volunteering program also saw participation from over 130 employees, who contributed more than 700 hours of service to eight charitable organizations across Italy. The initiative further strengthens the link between the company, its people, and the communities it serves.

Multi-Layered Social Impact through OTB Foundation

The OTB Foundation continued to serve as the cornerstone of the Group’s social responsibility agenda in 2024. Key projects included the “OTB Chiama Alice” free online mental health service for youth, the expansion of support for families in economic hardship, and refugee integration through employment-focused programs.

One standout initiative was “Brave Business in a Bus,” the first mobile incubator supporting female entrepreneurship in Afghanistan. The program enables women in Kabul to launch small businesses from home by providing comprehensive training, business tools, and practical lessons.

OTB Group’s slogan, “Be Responsible. Be Brave,” is more than just a catchphrase—it functions as a core value embedded in the company’s foundation. By driving transformation across environmental, social, and economic dimensions, OTB presents a compelling model for what the next phase of sustainability in the fashion industry can look like.

Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid funding because many of the patients they care for are low-income.
Nantz said Medicaid expansion and provider taxes have allowed the system to break even when taking care of Medicaid patients.
Republicans concerned about the impact of the provider tax reduction on rural hospitals inserted a $50 billion relief fund into the law.
The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.","(The Hill) — Hospitals are bracing for the impact of the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s sweeping spending and tax cut law.

While most of the cuts won’t happen immediately, rural facilities in particular say they likely will have to make difficult financial decisions about which services they can afford to keep and which may need to be cut.

Hospitals loudly raised alarms about the legislation, but their warnings went unheeded, and now they say they will bear the brunt of the changes.

The new law cuts about $1 trillion from Medicaid, primarily through stringent work requirements as well as reductions to how states can fund their Medicaid programs through provider taxes and state-directed payments.

Rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid funding because many of the patients they care for are low-income.

“Restrictions on state-directed payments and provider taxes cut off critical financial lifelines for hospitals,” Bruce Siegel, president and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals, said in a statement.

“State-directed payments are a critical source of support for hospitals, particularly in rural areas, and provider taxes help reduce the gap between Medicaid and other payers, ensuring that physicians can take Medicaid patients and hospitals can be adequately staffed. Cutting these lifelines is not sustainable, and it will harm patients.”

More than 300 rural hospitals in the U.S. are at risk of closing down because of the bill, according to research conducted by the University of North Carolina’s Sheps Center for Health Services Research and released last month by Democratic lawmakers.

Rural hospitals already operate on thin margins. The law’s Medicaid cuts will lead to more uninsured patients, meaning rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients, according to the report. In turn, they will face deeper financial strain.

Medicaid-dependent services — like labor and delivery units, mental health care, and emergency rooms — are some of the least profitable, yet most essential, services that hospitals provide. But experts said those will likely be cut as hospitals try to stay afloat.

In rural communities, Medicaid covers nearly half of all births and one-fifth of inpatient discharges, according to health research group KFF.

Republicans pushed back the start date for the provider tax reductions until 2028, and they won’t be fully phased in until 2031. The bill was only signed into law on July 4, so hospitals said it’s too early for them to know specifics on which services they’ll have to cut back on.

But the discussions are underway because hospitals need to start planning.

“If they see a very negative outlook in terms of Medicaid revenue reductions, increases in uncompensated care costs, I think that will tip the scales towards cutting services, cutting staff, not hiring, not expanding,” said Edwin Park, a research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University.

Mark Nantz, president and chief executive officer of Valley Health System, oversees a network that includes six hospitals in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and West Virginia, ranging from a 495-bed regional facility in Winchester to a 36-bed facility in Front Royal, about 70 miles outside of Washington.

Nantz said Medicaid expansion and provider taxes have allowed the system to break even when taking care of Medicaid patients. Previously, they were losing about 25 cents on every dollar.

Once the cuts are fully phased in, Nantz said Valley Health will lose about $50 million a year in revenue for Medicaid patients. The most likely casualty will be new construction and expansion plans, but he said it’s too early to know more.

“We’re not in a situation where we need to knee-jerk because we’re a pretty stable healthcare system, but it’s definitely going to change the way we look at expanding and the types of services that we offer in our six hospitals,” Nantz said.

Valley Health was able to expand the services it offers because it was not losing money on Medicaid, but that may not be able to continue. While hospitals may not close, some types of specialty care may be moved from rural facilities and centralized at the regional facility.

“We’ve got, really, two and a half to three years to make those kinds of decisions and prepare for what we will do. So we’re not threatening to cut jobs or hospitals or service locations or any of that right now,” Nantz said. “But we have to look at whether or not we can continue” offering the same types of services.

Republicans concerned about the impact of the provider tax reduction on rural hospitals inserted a $50 billion relief fund into the law. The law calls for the money to be distributed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) over five years.

The federal government will distribute half of the program’s $50 billion allotment equally among all states with an approved application over the next five years.

But experts said the money isn’t nearly enough to make up for the impact of the cuts. According to a KFF analysis, federal Medicaid spending in rural areas is estimated to decline by $155 billion over a decade.

The states and hospitals that will be hit the hardest will benefit the least, Park said.

He noted the law gives the Trump administration a lot of discretion on how they divide up the funds, so there’s potential for favoritism.

Every state has until the end of 2025 at the latest to apply for funds by submitting a “detailed rural health transformation plan” that addresses the program’s aims, according to the legislation.

But if CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz doesn’t agree with how states are using their funds, the law says he then “may withhold payments to, or reduce payments to, or recover previous payments from, the State.”

“It’s a fig leaf,” Park said. “The fund is temporary. These cuts are permanent.”",https://www.localsyr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/63/2025/07/AP25182757035200-e1752430683233.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-13 21:01:04.870775

A grave security bug was discovered in the hiring portal McHire, revealing the sensitive information of around 64 million applicants.

The most surprising aspect of this revelation was that the exceedingly ordinary and foreseeable password '123456' was employed on this system.

Security expert Ian Carroll and Sam Curry uncovered this security flaw. They discovered that there was an option to log in as ""Paradox team members"" on the admin panel of McHire. In it he attempted the default password and username '123456' and got access not only to the test server, but also the actual admin dashboard.

The researchers found an internal API endpoint from which information about any candidate could be obtained by entering only one predictable parameter. Not only this, some tokens were also found with the help of which any person could present himself in the identity of a candidate.

As soon as this report came out on June 30, McDonald's and its AI tech partner Paradox.ai took immediate action. By July 1, the default login credentials were disabled, and the related API was secured.

The bi-weekly pay structure is how millions of Americans get paid, yet this structure is a huge stressor for lots of people.

💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵

With a paycheck always a few days or weeks ahead, one unexpected expense, like a car repair or a medical bill, can mean an overdraft at the bank or a massive credit card bill that is hard to repay.

The bi-weekly pay structure is also one reason companies like Dollar Loan Center, MoneyMutual, and Advance America — businesses that offer short-term “paycheck” loans — have thrived over the years, even though they frequently face accusations of predatory lending practices.

Now, a new study reveals insight that might make employers reconsider how they manage this part of their business.

Bi‑weekly pay leads to chronic stress

The current pay structure has hidden consequences. Workers must manage bill due dates and budget for food, rent, phone, internet, etc., all while wondering whether their next check will cover it.

For hourly workers who don't have much savings, the cycle can create a frenzy of short-term financial triage.

The constant financial juggling can take a toll on mental health, straining relationships and reducing productivity at work — all of which is bad for employers.

In a recent Talker Research-commissioned survey, conducted May 13-21, 2025, among 2,000 U.S. hourly workers, including 1,000 who work in retail, nearly 39% reported that living paycheck to paycheck with a consistent income would be an upgrade compared to their current financial situation — and 44% had recently overdrafted their account.

""For a long time, 'living paycheck to paycheck' was considered to be the lowest tier of financial wellness,"" a Talker Research spokesperson told TheStreet. ""In this tier, people aren't able to put their money into savings or level up financially because all their money is going toward immediate needs like rent and groceries. But now, the data shows that many aren't even able to live paycheck to paycheck, slipping into an even lower tier of financial wellness.""

The survey also found:

38% of hourly workers have less than $1,000 in savings.

19% of hourly workers took out loans in the past year to get through the pay cycle.

34% of hourly workers rely on two or more jobs to stay afloat.

Many resort to extreme measures — selling personal property or even dumpster diving — to survive, according to the survey.

This data suggests that current pay structures are both inconvenient and insufficient.

On‑demand pay is a preference for many, not just a perk

The solution may lie in on-demand pay, also known as “earned wage access” (EWA), where workers can access a portion of their earned wages before designated paydays.

Of course, there are dozens of companies competing for employers’ attention in this sector. DailyPay, Payactiv, Earnin, Branch, ZayZoon, and Wagestream are just a few of the EWA companies that have popped up in the last few years.

The survey found that 78% of workers believe having this option would stabilize their finances.

Among those already receiving on-demand wages, results are promising, per Talker Research:

22% of hourly workers used their wages for groceries and essentials;

20% of hourly workers avoided late or missed bill payments; and

15% of hourly workers reported lower financial stress.

These sorts of changes could also benefit employers. Since financial stress correlates with mental strain, absenteeism, and lower productivity, employers who rethink paydays could be rewarded with a stronger workforce.

While we wait for official numbers to come out for Q2 which just closed last Monday, June 30, the year was off to a stellar start when Q1 buybacks hit a record of $293B, according to S&P Global. The previous record was set in Q1 2022 when buybacks totaled $281B.[1] Analysts have said they expect 2025 to hit $1T in total buybacks.[2]

Buybacks remained top heavy, with the top 20 S&P 500 companies accounting for 48.4% of Q1 2025 buybacks, a slight decrease from 49% in Q4 2024. While the concentration amongst top stock repurchases still exists, more companies within the S&P 500 have been repurchasing stock as of late, and the number purchasing over 1% of their public stock has increased.[3] This story changes slightly when you look globally.

Total Number of Global Companies Announcing Buybacks is Lower

Despite the dollar level of buybacks hitting records, Wall Street Horizon data shows that the actual number of announcements has been relatively low, historically speaking. The second quarter closed out with 164 announcements, that comes after Q1 recorded 168 buyback announcements. The quarterly average over the last five years has been 204 announcements. You can see in the chart below that those numbers are steadily climbing after bottom-ing out in 2023.

An Age-Old Debate: Are Buybacks Good or Bad?

As interest rates fall, as many are expecting at the next Fed meeting on July 30, holding onto cash tends to become less attractive to corporations who want to deploy and put it to work. Typically, buybacks are a good thing for shareholders as well, as they artificially improve earnings per share of a company, if not actually improving earnings. Share repurchases come under fire for this reason as well, with many arguing that companies could have put the money to better use by investing it back into the company. Investors tend to prefer companies that are buying back shares while also investing in growth. A great example is the mega tech names, many of which are the largest buyers of their own stock, but also tend to invest heavily in research and development and AI, among other things.

The Bottom-Line

As the Q2 earnings season begins on Tuesday, July 15th with reports from major banks, investors should closely monitor buyback announcements. An increase in share repurchases would indicate corporate America's renewed willingness to deploy cash, which could have positive implications for the US economy.

For Albertsons Media Collective, the chain’s media arm, the physical store at Cannes, stocked with products ready to be sold, represented the ultimate goal: getting products off the shelves and into customers’ hands.

According to Evan Hovorka, VP, product and innovation, Albertsons Media Collective, their presence in Cannes “really reflects our DNA,” adding, “We exist to provide shoppers with cost-effective food solutions.” Hovorka said that bringing this mission to Cannes completes the circle, encompassing media, merchandising, and product sales.

In-store media network

Also at the festival, Albertsons Media Collective launched an in-store digital display network to provide brands and agencies “a more robust way for them to tell their story directly to our shoppers at the most important point of their decision-making process,” Hovorka said.

The network allows them to present creative media-driven narratives featuring recipes, sustainability programs, or new product launches.

The timing is crucial, said Hovorka. Customers are already in the store and ready to spend, making it an ideal moment to connect brands with shoppers. “There couldn’t be a more beautiful way to connect a brand to the shopper,” Hovorka said.

According to eMarketer, in-store retail media ad spending is projected to exceed $500 million in 2025, which supports the emphasis on connecting with shoppers at the point of sale.

Video ads complete the picture

Hovorka noted that the network features high-resolution video ad units distributed across stores, which he sees as an improvement over static images found in other retailers. While shelf tags and screen prints remain important components of a retail media network, “now we’ve got the most exciting missing piece, which is that inspirational video,” Hovorka said.

Hovorka offered an example of influencers showcasing a new guacamole recipe leading into Cinco de Mayo, displayed above avocados on sale, adding that it “really is the icing on the cake to complete our full omni-channel journey.”

Albertsons Media Collective launched “Collective TV” in June 2024, integrating retail media with television advertising, which aligns with the strategy of using video to create richer storytelling.

The pilot program launches across 80 stores, with plans to scale to 2,300 stores. “This is an opportunity for brands and agencies to invest early, help us shape this narrative and shape this product into something that’s going to work best for everybody involved,” Hovorka said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/97784-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 14:03:45.490413

He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.” Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund.
I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.
When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.","SINGAPORE: McDonald’s Singapore has issued an apology after a customer complained about an unusually long wait time and an unpleasant exchange with a manager at its Hougang 1 outlet.

Mr Tay, who shared his experience with citizen journalism platform Stomp, said he had placed a takeaway order at the restaurant at 10.28pm on June 7. Despite initially waiting patiently, he only received his food at 11.16pm—48 minutes later.

According to Mr Tay, the store was busy when he arrived, so he did not mind waiting at first. However, by 10.55pm, he noticed that other customers who had ordered around the same time were already leaving.

“I asked an auntie at the counter about it. She told me to wait for my order as it was still being prepared,” Mr Tay told Stomp, “After 10 minutes, I asked her again. She told me to wait.”

When his order was eventually ready close to 11.16pm, Mr Tay requested to speak to the duty manager to understand the delay. What followed, he said, was an unpleasant encounter.

“The auntie told him about it, but he turned his head, ignored me and carried on doing his things,” Mr Tay wrote in his feedback to McDonald’s, “After that, the auntie called him again, and he unwillingly came to the counter.”

Mr Tay alleged that the manager’s demeanour quickly turned confrontational when he asked why the food had taken so long.

“He immediately started with a rude attitude, opening his eyes wide and talking like a gangster,” Mr Tay claimed, “He challenged me and asked why I couldn’t see that the store was busy—are the kitchen staff dancing? He also asked if I wanted to refund my order.”

Mr Tay, who said he had ordered the meal for a family birthday, declined the refund. He also expressed shock when the manager suggested he was being disrespectful.

“I asked him why he was so rude. He told me that I did not give him ‘face’ in front of other customers and staff. I was so surprised as I just wanted to know why it took so long,” Mr Tay said.

When Mr Tay asked for the manager’s name to file a complaint, the situation escalated further.

“He threw his name tag on the desk. When I wanted to take a picture of it, he timidly snatched it back and asked me to take a photo of the ‘shift manager on duty’,” Mr Tay recounted, “It was definitely a forgotten order and the manager was not apologetic at all.”

In his feedback, Mr Tay described the manager’s behaviour as “frightening” and said the entire episode left him “a very disappointed customer”.

McDonald’s Singapore has since apologised over the episode. A spokesperson told Stomp, “We’re sorry to hear about what happened and have since reached out to make things right. Consistent service matters to us, and we’ve taken steps—including reinforcing training with our team—to help prevent this from happening again.”

Mr Tay later confirmed that McDonald’s had contacted him, apologised, and refunded the cost of the meal. Reflecting on the outcome, he said: “Social media power is very fantastic.”",https://media.theindependent.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-13-021013.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 15:05:57.112999

The newsroom approaches each quarter with a nervous energy, but this summer it feels especially heightened. Recent market records in both the U.S. and Europe, alongside an unpredictable economic environment, paint a complicated picture for the second half.

It all kicks off on Tuesday with America's banking behemoths, as attention switches from the White House back to Wall Street.

But U.S. President Donald Trump's policies still loom large, with Goldman Sachs predicting that, this quarter, U.S. earnings will start to show the impact of the tariffs.

The investment bank's economists see ""conflicting messages on the margin outlook"" as companies have only announced modest price increases, despite the cost hikes associated with higher tariffs.

Earnings-per-share growth is also set to come under pressure, with Goldman suggesting, ""the consensus estimate among analysts sees S&P 500 companies' earnings-per-share growth decelerating to 4% this quarter relative to the same quarter last year — down from 12% in the first quarter.""

With the banks set to dominate next week — JPMorgan , Citi , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are all reporting within just two days — maybe Europe can provide some optimism.

As reported by CNBC's Jenni Reid, European banks just recorded their best first half since 1997. Gains were driven by strong investment banking returns — something their U.S. counterparts are also likely to capitalize on — as well as stock rallies based on both deal speculation and actual M&A.

As someone who grew up in Cape Town, seeing this year's G20 meetings take place in South Africa makes me pine for the sunshine of the Southern hemisphere.

Next week's meeting in Durban between finance ministers and central bank governors comes at an interesting time for the country.

An Oval Office meeting between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Trump went spectacularly wrong back in May, when the latter, flanked by his South African (now former) right-hand man Elon Musk, made false claims of a ""white genocide.""

It seems tensions have not abated.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will skip the meeting altogether, opting to head to Japan instead, according to Reuters. South Africa is also subject to a new 30% tariff rate, the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to be singled out in the latest round of announcements.

It does not bode well for the G20 Leaders meeting, due to be held in Gauteng on Nov. 22-23. It remains to be seen if Trump will attend.

Good news: firms racing to deliver “green steel” by 2030 are changing the game. They’re using clean energy and hydrogen to cut pollution. H2 Green Steel plans to make 5 million tons yearly without coal.

Want to know who’s leading the charge? Keep reading.

Key Takeaways

H2 Green Steel aims to produce 5 million tons of green steel yearly by 2030 using hydrogen-based tech, cutting CO2 emissions by 95%. Their Swedish plant will start deliveries by 2025.

ArcelorMittal invests in hydrogen-powered DRI units and hybrid electric arc furnaces, partnering with governments to meet decarbonization goals under policies like the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.

Hybrit shipped the world’s first fossil-free steel prototypes to Volvo and plans full commercial production by 2026, replacing coal with green hydrogen in iron-making.

The SteelZero Initiative pushes firms to commit to 50% lower emissions by 2030 and net-zero steel by 2050, with members like Mercedes-Benz targeting 200,000 tons of CO2-reduced steel yearly.

First Movers Coalition, including GM and Volvo, drives demand by pledging to buy 10% near-zero carbon steel by 2030, accelerating clean tech like H2-DRI and renewable-powered EAFs.

H2 Green Steel

H2 Green Steel aims to churn out 5 million tons of green steel yearly by 2030. Their secret weapon? Hydrogen-based tech that slashes carbon emissions like a hot knife through butter.

This Swedish startup isn’t just talking the talk—they’re building Europe’s first large-scale, hydrogen-powered steel plant. Imagine steel made without coal, just clean hydrogen and renewable electricity.

Game changer.

Targeting 5 million tons of green steel annually by 2030

H2 Green Steel wants to make 5 million tons of green steel every year by 2030. They use hydrogen-based tech to cut CO2 emissions. First batches will roll out by 2025, showing big scale-up plans.

Their process skips traditional blast furnaces. Instead, they rely on green hydrogen and renewable electricity. This slashes greenhouse gas emissions from steel production. The goal is clear, hit mass output fast without breaking the climate bank.

Use of hydrogen-based reduction technology

H2 Green Steel plans to cut emissions by 95% at its Swedish plant. It uses hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (DRI) tech, where hydrogen reacts with iron ore in a tower. The process leaves only water vapor as waste, no CO₂.

The hydrogen comes from electrolysis, powered by renewable energy and local river water. This green steel method skips fossil fuels entirely, unlike traditional blast furnaces. Big players like ArcelorMittal and HYBRIT are betting on similar tech to hit net-zero goals fast.

Costs remain high, but scaling up could make it the norm by 2030.

ArcelorMittal

ArcelorMittal is betting big on hydrogen-powered DRI plants to slash emissions. The steel giant also taps hybrid electric arc furnaces running on clean energy.

Investment in DRI units and hybrid EAF systems

ArcelorMittal is putting money into Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) units and hybrid Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) to slash carbon emissions. DRI tech cuts reliance on coal, while EAFs melt scrap steel using renewable energy.

The steel giant’s move aims for cleaner production. Hybrid EAF systems blend recycled materials with low-carbon iron, cutting the carbon footprint of each ton made. This shift supports global decarbonization goals without sacrificing output.

Collaboration with governments for decarbonization

ArcelorMittal is working closely with governments to cut carbon emissions. The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism raises costs for imports of non-green steel, pushing local producers toward cleaner solutions.

This policy helps companies like ArcelorMittal compete fairly while hitting climate goals.

Consumer demand and green policies are speeding up the shift to low-carbon steel. Partnerships with officials ensure funding for hydrogen-based tech and carbon capture. It’s a team effort—businesses and lawmakers are driving the change together.

Hybrit

Hybrit already shipped fossil-free steel samples to Volvo, proving green steel can work today. By 2026, this Swedish venture aims to flip the switch to full-scale production, swapping coal for hydrogen in the iron-making process.

The company’s pilot plant runs on clean energy and water electrolysis technology—no blast furnace smokestacks here. If their model catches on, steel could shed its dirty reputation faster than you’d think.

Delivered fossil-free steel prototypes to Volvo

Hybrit made history by delivering the first batch of fossil-free steel to Volvo. The steel was used for prototypes, marking a major step toward cleaner production. Instead of coal, Hybrit uses green hydrogen in its process, cutting carbon emissions drastically.

Volvo aims to build cars with this low-carbon steel by 2026. The shift could reshape auto manufacturing while fighting climate change. No coke oven gas or blast furnaces are needed, just clean electricity and hydrogen-based tech.

A game-changer for heavy industry!

Plans for commercial production by 2026

Hybrit aims to roll out commercial green steel production by 2026. The company already delivered fossil-free steel prototypes to Volvo, proving hydrogen-based reduction works.

This partnership helps make green steel more affordable and available by 2030.

Innovations Driving Green Steel Production

New tech is shaking up steelmaking, with hydrogen-based DRI and electric arc furnaces stealing the spotlight. Companies are betting big on renewables to power these cleaner methods, turning old-school smelters into lean, green machines.

Hydrogen-based Direct Reduced Iron (H2-DRI)

Hydrogen-based Direct Reduced Iron (H2-DRI) is a game-changer for green steel. It replaces coal with hydrogen to cut emissions. In this process, hydrogen reacts with iron ore in a DRI tower, leaving just water vapor as waste.

Companies like H2 Green Steel use electrolysis to make hydrogen from water and renewable power.

The technology slashes carbon footprints by skipping fossil fuels. Unlike traditional methods, it avoids CO₂-heavy blast furnaces. Renewable energy powers the electric arc furnaces that melt the iron.

This combo—clean hydrogen and green electricity—puts low-carbon steel within reach by 2030.

Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) powered by renewable energy

Electric Arc Furnaces (EAF) melt scrap steel using renewable electricity, cutting carbon emissions. Unlike traditional blast furnaces, they don’t burn coal, making them cleaner for green steel production.

H2 Green Steel’s plant in Boden, Sweden, runs entirely on renewable power, showing how EAFs can slash CO₂ emissions.

These furnaces work fast and fit well with wind and solar energy. Paired with hydrogen-based reduction tech or recycled steel, EAFs help create low-carbon steel faster. The challenge? High costs and needing steady clean power.

But as grids go greener, so will the steel industry.

Recycling and circularity initiatives

Steel recycling cuts carbon emissions and boosts the circular economy. KIRCHHOFF and H2 Green Steel plan to feed at least 30% of scrap steel back into electric arc furnaces, slashing waste and energy use.

Old steel gets a second life, reducing the need for new raw materials. This lowers the carbon footprint of production while saving costs. Scrap melts faster in furnaces, needing less power.

It’s a win for green energy goals and cleaner steel manufacturing.

Challenges in Scaling Green Steel

Making green steel isn’t cheap, and high production costs still slow down progress. Finding enough hydrogen and building new infrastructure also stand in the way of scaling up fast.

High production costs

Making green steel isn’t cheap. The tech needed, like hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H2-DRI) and electric arc furnaces (EAF), costs way more than traditional methods. Clean energy inputs, like green hydrogen or renewable electricity, also drive prices up compared to fossil fuels.

Securing enough low-carbon hydrogen adds another hurdle. Right now, producing it through steam methane reforming with carbon capture or electrolysis is expensive without subsidies.

Smaller firms face tough competition from big players who can afford the high capital expenditure for scaling up fast. The European Green Deal helps but doesn’t erase the gap overnight.

Prices must drop before green steel can compete globally against cheaper, dirtier options tied to volatile oil prices or OPEC+ supply chains.

Infrastructure requirements

Green steel needs big changes in infrastructure. Factories must switch to hydrogen-based reduction tech and electric arc furnaces powered by renewable electricity. New facilities require massive investments, like H2 Green Steel’s $3 billion plant in Sweden.

Transport and storage of green hydrogen add another hurdle. Pipelines and ports must adapt to handle this clean fuel. Countries like Germany and China are already upgrading grids and storage to support low-carbon steel production.

Without these fixes, scaling up remains tough.

Securing hydrogen supply

Hydrogen supply is a major hurdle for green steel production. Making enough hydrogen from renewable energy, like solar or wind power, requires massive investments in electrolyzers and infrastructure.

Without it, companies can’t replace fossil fuels in processes like Direct Reduced Iron (DRI) production.

Countries and firms are racing to scale up green hydrogen projects, but costs remain high. Some producers rely on carbon capture and storage (CCS) with natural gas as a stopgap. The goal? Shift fully to clean hydrogen by 2030 to cut carbon emissions in steelmaking for good.

Takeaways

The race for green steel is heating up, with eight firms leading the charge. These companies use hydrogen, renewable power, and smart tech to slash emissions. Costs remain high, but partnerships and new laws are speeding up progress.

Every ton of green steel cuts global carbon footprints. The shift won’t be easy, but the payoff is huge. The future of steel is green, and it’s coming fast.

To combat slowing sales, Starbucks hired former Chipotle executive Brian Niccol as its chair and CEO in August. Niccol addressed the situation directly at the time, saying, “It is clear we need to fundamentally change our strategy to win back customers.""

Niccol named the company's new ""Back to Starbucks"" plan as the key to that change, saying, ""My experience tells me that when we get back to our core identity and consistently deliver a great experience, our customers will come back.""

Part of the company's plan is to attract consumers back to Starbucks as a community gathering space, moving away from the quick-speed tweaks it implemented in prior years.

Since announcing the plan, Starbucks has made a variety of other changes, including writing on cups again, bringing back the condiment bar, ditching the non-dairy upcharge, and adding additional coverage hours in 3,000 of its locations.

In addition to all those tweaks, it's also got a new drink coming to weather the hottest part of summer.

Starbucks has a new take on cold brew

Since it's the hottest time of the year, Starbucks has decided it's time to deliver something exciting with a tasty new spin on a coffee classic: the cold brew.

As we reported previously, Starbucks is bringing back a raspberry syrup it originally discontinued in 2023.

“Starbucks will also be bringing back raspberry syrup for a very limited time this July to delight fans, and the company plans to bring more flavor drops in the future,” the company said in a June 10 news release.

However, Starbucks also has a new drink coming, which it hasn't yet revealed: a Raspberry Cream cold brew, as reporter by food blogger Markie Devo via his X account on July 10.

Devo says that several employees have told him the new drink is coming, which is the chain's signature coffee sweetened with vanilla syrup and topped with a raspberry cream cold foam.

Devo originally reported that the drink could come out on July 24 for rewards members and July 29 nationwide, but it looks like those dates have been changed just a bit, as now the new drink drops for a limited time on July 28.

Starbucks employees sound off on the changes

While Niccol promises the Back to Starbucks program will transform the brand, there's one group of people who don't love the changes: the baristas.

The Starbucks subreddit features a fair number of complaints about the new policies, with one focused heavily on the return to writing on cups.

""WRITING ON CUPS IS STUPID. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY. It slows us down, no one likes doing it, being coached for not doing it is ridiculous, the customers don’t f**king care,"" wrote one user, who also claimed the practice was unsanitary.

Another user called out the menu simplification, calling Niccol's ordered changes ""laughable.""

""Sure, he took away some pastries (but added some),"" the user wrote. ""Took away creme based frappuccinos which are still being ordered, which are now simply harder and more time consuming to ring up (which makes it more difficult to meet their strict ""peak"" time crunches).

Soybean oil is being used as a sustainable replacement for petroleum and other oils in tire sidewalls.

Firestone uses racing as a testing ground for new tire technologies before implementing them in consumer tires.

NEWTON—Tires made in part with soybeans grown in Iowa will be coming soon to Firestone stores.

Firestone, IndyCar's tire manufacturer, tests tire technology by using it first in its IndyCar tires before making it more widely available in consumer tires. The company is owned by Bridgestone Americas, which employs 700 people at its Des Moines Agricultural Tire Plant. The plant also makes Firestone tires for tractors.

Cara Krstolic, Firestone race tire engineering and production executive director, said that Firestone's consumer tires — whether manufactured for cars or tractors — share some materials with its racing tires. In 2022, Firestone introduced an alternative tire made from guayule, a plant that grows in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico, to use on street courses. More recently, Firestone added soybean oil to its race tires.

Soybean oil is used in sidewalls of tires, and the company is experimenting with other uses for it, Krstolic said.

""Leftover residual oil from the soybean can be used to replace petroleum,"" Krstolic said. ""And it can also work on reducing some of our other oils in the tires.""

Soybeans are also more renewable than other plants Firestone has experimented with, she said.

""The nice thing about the soybean is that there's enough sources that you can get that (and) you're not competing as food source,"" Krstolic said. ""

Among the products Firestone makes at Bridgestone's Des Moines factory are tractor tires, which sit on a tractor in Victory Lane.

Since its inception, car and tire manufacturers have used racing to test products before rolling sales out to consumers. Firestone founder Harvey Firestone coined the phrase, ""Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.""

Each race weekend Firestone brings about 20 people to mount tires and six engineers to monitor tire temperatures and other data on tires. Eventually all of this work at Iowa Speedway and IndyCar's 15 other tracks makes it into consumer tires, Krstolic said.

""Racing is a mobile lab,"" Krstolic said. ""Where else can you see the extremes of heat and durability and performance than on race tracks?... So there are materials that we'll put into this race and other races that we can prove out at speeds of 200 mph.""

The bank's Q2 2025 earnings, to be released on July 17, will offer critical insights into its ability to navigate challenges such as declining interest rates and rising costs while maintaining peer-leading returns. Under CEO Gunjan Kedia's leadership, the bank is executing a multi-pronged strategy to enhance profitability, expand digitally, and capitalize on partnerships—all hallmarks of a resilient outperformer.

Leadership Transition Fuels Strategic Focus

Kedia's April 2025 appointment as CEO marked a pivotal shift. A veteran of the bank's corporate and investment divisions, she has prioritized operational discipline and growth through technology and partnerships. Alongside CFO John Stern, she has outlined ambitious targets: boosting the net interest margin (NIM) to over 3% from 2.72% in Q1 2025 and cutting costs via four new initiatives. These moves align with her vision to balance risk management with aggressive pursuit of revenue synergies from the Union Bank acquisition. Analysts note her potential to accelerate digital transformation, a critical edge in an industry increasingly defined by fintech disruption.

Strategic Initiatives: Efficiency and Digital Growth

U.S. Bancorp's Q2 focus hinges on two pillars: optimizing its existing customer base and leveraging partnerships to drive capital-light growth. The bank's Q1 ROTCE of 17.5%—up from 16.5% in Q1 2024—demonstrates operational leverage, but sustaining this will require execution on cost-saving measures and NIM expansion.

The partnership with Fiserv, announced in June, is a case in point. Integrating U.S. Bank's Elan credit card program into Fiserv's Credit Choice platform creates a seamless digital experience for consumers and small businesses. This collaboration, set to fully convert by year-end, reduces operational friction and expands U.S. Bancorp's reach without physical branch investments. Similarly, its long-running partnership with State Farm—now offering co-branded credit cards and loans—has generated 120,000 accounts in 2023 alone, showcasing the power of third-party networks to scale efficiently.

Navigating Challenges: Cost Discipline and Interest Rate Headwinds

The bank faces headwinds, including gradual interest rate cuts and rising expenses. U.S. Bancorp's Q1 noninterest expense rose 3.5% year-over-year to $4.1 billion, a trend it aims to reverse through cost-saving measures. The goal is an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s by 2026-2027, down from 60.8% in Q1 2025.

On NIM, the bank is countering rate pressures through loan growth (up 0.9% Q/Q to $381.8 billion) and deposit optimization. Its strategy to reduce reliance on high-cost deposits and favor loan growth—particularly in commercial and corporate segments—should help achieve the 3% NIM target. However, the Federal Reserve's potential cuts later this year could test this approach.

Valuation and Investment Considerations

At current levels, U.S. Bancorp's stock trades at 1.6x tangible book value, below its five-year average of 1.8x, suggesting undervaluation relative to peers. Its dividend yield of 2.8%—supported by a strong capital position (Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.8% in Q1)—offers stability.

Investors should monitor Q2 results for progress on:

1. NIM expansion and cost-saving execution.

2. Noninterest income growth (targeted at 5% annually).

3. Loan growth trends and credit quality metrics.

Risks include prolonged rate cuts, which could pressure NII, and execution delays in digital partnerships. Yet, the bank's fortress balance sheet (nonperforming assets at 0.45% in Q1) and ethical reputation—ranked among the 2025 World's Most Ethical Companies—provide a safety net.

Conclusion: A Resilient Outperformer

U.S. Bancorp's strategic moves under Kedia position it as a resilient competitor in an evolving banking landscape. Its focus on digital innovation, cost discipline, and partnerships reduces reliance on traditional branch expansion, while its financial metrics—ROTEC and efficiency ratio—signal operational strength. While challenges remain, the bank's execution could validate its undervalued stock, making it a compelling pick for investors seeking stability in a volatile sector.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:02:58.975268

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future.","The retail landscape is undergoing a seismic shift, driven by rising theft, evolving consumer expectations, and the relentless march of e-commerce. At the epicenter of this transformation stands Walmart, whose bold moves to combat theft and dominate online grocery sales offer a blueprint for retailers navigating today's challenges. By integrating physical and digital strategies while addressing loss prevention, Walmart is redefining the rules of the game—and investors would be wise to take note.

The Anti-Theft Tightrope: Balancing Security and Trust

Walmart's recent anti-theft initiatives—locking meats in tamper-resistant cages, deploying AI-driven checkout systems, and embedding hidden barcodes—aim to stem losses that cost U.S. retailers $61 billion annually. These measures have sparked public outcry, with critics calling Walmart's “imprisoned” food displays a betrayal of its value-driven ethos. TikTok users and consumer advocacy groups have amplified concerns, citing a 16.5% rise in discrimination complaints linked to intrusive security practices.

Yet, Walmart's actions are strategic. Theft at self-checkouts has surged by 30% since 2020, and the company cannot afford to cede ground to competitors or erode margins further. The operational costs of these changes—new technologies, staff training, and potential declines in customer convenience—are substantial. However, Walmart's scale and infrastructure (e.g., 4,700 U.S. stores) allow it to absorb these expenses while maintaining its dominance.

The E-Commerce Edge: Walmart's 31.6% Market Share Lead

Walmart's true advantage lies in its omnichannel strategy. With 31.6% of the U.S. online grocery market—$63.79 billion in projected 2025 sales—the company outpaces Amazon (22.6%) and Instacart (21.6%) by prioritizing value, convenience, and integration. Its Walmart+ membership program, which offers free delivery and cash-back incentives, has driven a 21% year-over-year global e-commerce sales growth. Meanwhile, delivery costs per order have dropped nearly 40%, thanks to AI-optimized logistics and store-fulfilled orders.

The data underscores Walmart's resilience:

While Amazon's Prime ecosystem and Instacart's delivery network remain formidable, Walmart's physical-digital hybrid model—where 72.2% of its online sales flow directly through its own platform—gives it an edge in controlling pricing, inventory, and customer experience. Shoppers, particularly cost-conscious families, reward this integration: Walmart's average order value exceeds competitors' by 20%.

Competitive Dynamics: Why Walmart's Playbook Works

Amazon and Instacart face structural limitations. Amazon's grocery sales, though growing, rely heavily on one-off purchases (e.g., toiletries), whereas Walmart dominates full-basket shopping. Instacart, while the top delivery intermediary (57.7% of U.S. delivery sales), struggles as retailers like Walmart and Kroger build in-house logistics to reduce reliance on third parties.

Walmart's strategy also addresses a key consumer shift: the demand for seamless omnichannel experiences. Its 2025 delivery share rose nearly 8 percentage points year-over-year, and its pickup services remain preferred by 45.5% of shoppers. By leveraging generative AI for dynamic pricing and personalized recommendations, Walmart is not just keeping pace but setting the pace.

Investment Implications: Betting on Loss Prevention and Omnichannel Mastery

Walmart's moves signal a broader industry trend: retailers must prioritize loss prevention and omnichannel integration to thrive. Investors should favor companies that:

1. Control the end-to-end customer journey (e.g., Walmart's integrated stores and apps).

2. Invest in AI and automation to reduce costs and enhance customer experience.

3. Maintain low prices without sacrificing margins through supply chain efficiency.

Walmart's stock, currently trading at $152.30 (as of July 2025), offers a compelling entry point. Its dividend yield of 1.2% and consistent e-commerce growth (outpacing overall revenue) make it a defensive play in a volatile market. Meanwhile, Amazon's reliance on high-margin digital services and Instacart's dependency on retailer partnerships leave them exposed to margin pressures and competition.

Conclusion: The New Rules of Retail

Walmart's anti-theft measures and e-commerce dominance are more than tactical moves—they're a blueprint for the future. By balancing security with convenience, leveraging scale to absorb costs, and owning the customer experience from shelf to doorstep, Walmart is proving that the winners of the retail revolution will be those who master both physical and digital worlds. For investors, this is a signal to back retailers with similar strategies: those who innovate without losing sight of their core values.

In a sector where theft, convenience, and trust are existential battlegrounds, Walmart's resilience is a harbinger of things to come. The question isn't whether the retail revolution will succeed—it's already here. The answer is who will lead it. For now, the answer is Walmart.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 12:09:56.415167

""We could see all of the employees of the restaurant were simply employees of Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire.
I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless.
Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people.
Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure.","A pair of security researchers has revealed vulnerabilities in the McHire chatbot Paradox, developed for McDonald's, that could have been exploited to reveal personal information about roughly 64 million people who have used the service to apply for jobs at their local franchises. (Hat-tip Wired.)

I was ""hacked"" the first time when I was 14. I put that in scare quotes because the password for the account was ""1234."" (Without the quotes or period, of course, which makes it even worse.) After I regained access to the account, I started using a password manager.

Why is that relevant? Because the researchers who found these vulnerabilities, Ian Carroll and Sam Curry, were able to guess the password used by ""Paradox team members"" to access McHire: ""123456."" That's slightly better than the password I used, I guess, but not enough to justify its use decades after most people realized that using weak passwords is a bad idea.

There is some good news: ""It turned out we had become the administrator of a test restaurant inside the McHire system,"" Carroll and Curry wrote. ""We could see all of the employees of the restaurant were simply employees of Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire. This was great because we could now see how the app worked, but annoying because we had still not demonstrated any actual confidentiality or integrity impact.""

That's where the second vulnerability comes in. (Or the first, depending on whether or not you count the embarrassingly bad password as a true vuln.) An insecure direct object reference (IDOR) flaw in the McHire API allowed Carroll and Curry to gain access to the following information from ""every chat interaction [from anyone who] ever applied for a job at McDonald’s"":

Name, email address, phone number, address

Candidacy state and every state change/form input the candidate had submitted (shifts they could work, etc)

Auth token to log into the consumer UI as that user, leaking their raw chat messages and presumably other information

Carroll and Curry noted that Paradox had previously bragged that 90% of McDonald's franchises were using McHire as part of their hiring practices. (That link still leads to the appropriate post on Paradox's blog, but the section related to McDonald's has been removed, and neither the Wayback Machine nor Google's cache has saved old versions of the post. Weird!)

So let's compare and contrast. I secured a forum account with the password ""1234"" when I was a teenager; that account's compromise was ultimately meaningless. Paradox raised $200 million in 2020, McDonald's has a $213 billion market cap, and McHire's flaws exposed information about tens of millions of people. But at least their password was two characters longer!

Perhaps the only bright side is that Carroll and Curry said the McHire vulnerabilities were addressed a day after their disclosure. Hopefully the companies involved will hold themselves to a McHigher standard now.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBqPkqxoqRvnkMAvWbk3JD.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:10:59.921501

Recognized as Africa’s largest airline and one of the fastest-growing global aviation brands, Ethiopian Airlines continues to embody an African success story — one that has translated a bold vision into a world-class reality over the past eight decades. The airline currently serves over 160 passenger and cargo destinations across five continents.

More than just a carrier, Ethiopian plays a strategic role in connecting Africa to the rest of the world.

Vision 2035 is rooted in a commitment to safe, secure, market-responsive, and customer-focused services across a diverse portfolio that includes passenger and cargo operations, logistics, aviation training, airport management, ground handling, aircraft maintenance (MRO), aerospace manufacturing, and travel and tourism.

CEO Mesfin stated that the airline is implementing the roadmap with an emphasis on “fast and profitable growth.” Key components of this effort include network expansion, fleet modernization, and enhanced operational efficiency.

“As part of this strategy, we’ve continued to open new routes,” he said, citing recent additions such as Sharjah (UAE), Hyderabad (India), Oporto (Portugal), and Hanoi (Vietnam). He noted that Ethiopian inaugurated its Hanoi route this Thursday, underscoring its ongoing global expansion.

Increasing the frequency of flights to existing destinations also remains a key focus, Mesfin added. He revealed that the airline is actively exploring new long-haul opportunities, including a potential launch of services to Australia. A feasibility study for that route is currently underway.

On fleet development, Mesfin confirmed that Ethiopian has placed orders for approximately 120 new aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus. These include Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the next-generation 777X, along with Airbus A350s. The airline is also currently receiving deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX, with two aircraft received last month and more scheduled for arrival.

To enhance its regional capacity, the airline is evaluating options for acquiring additional 100-seat aircraft, with new orders expected to be placed soon.

Beyond fleet and route expansion, Ethiopian is also deepening its global footprint through strategic partnerships. The CEO disclosed that the airline is currently collaborating with four foreign carriers and remains open to additional joint ventures.

“Several countries have expressed interest in partnering with us to establish their own national carriers,” he told local news agency ENA. “Our approach typically begins with a feasibility study to assess the viability of such initiatives.”

Ethiopian Airlines’ strategic momentum signals a continued rise as a global aviation leader, firmly anchored in its African identity and driven by innovation, connectivity, and resilience.",https://www.fanamc.com/english/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1752393614098-1024x585.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 12:09:23.491334

In a shocking cybersecurity lapse, McDonald’s AI-powered hiring tool reportedly exposed the personal data of more than 64 million job applicants — all because it was secured with the world’s most infamous password: “123456”.

The vulnerability was discovered last month by security researchers who, out of curiosity, decided to probe the fast food giant’s recruitment chatbot after a Reddit thread highlighted how poorly it was responding to job seekers.

According to WIRED, they shared the details of the breach on Wednesday (9 July), and McDonald’s has also confirmed that they have patched the security risk.

Researcher gains access to personal data using default login credentials

Security expert Ian Carroll detailed the breach in a blog post, explaining that he was drawn to investigate McHire, McDonald’s AI recruitment system, after seeing a Reddit post about its chatbot, Olivia.

The Reddit post shared a frustrating interaction between a job applicant and the AI chatbot, with the bot giving nonsensical answers.

After just a few hours, he and fellow researcher Sam Curry stumbled upon a serious flaw — they could log in using default admin credentials, where both the username and password were simply “123456”.

This granted them full access to a database containing the private information of more than 64 million applicants, including names, email addresses, and phone numbers.

Breach reported, vulnerability fixed within hours

Upon discovering the flaw, the researchers immediately contacted Paradox.ai, the company behind McHire, and McDonald’s. The alert was sent on 30 June, prompting swift action.

Paradox.ai patched the vulnerability within hours, later confirming in a blog post that no unauthorised parties accessed the system, and that the only individuals who did were the two ethical researchers.

They also pledged to launch a bug bounty programme to catch such issues in future.

“We do not take this matter lightly, even though it was resolved swiftly and effectively,” they told WIRED. “We own this.”

Meanwhile, McDonald’s agreed that Paradox.ai were to blame.

“We’re disappointed by this unacceptable vulnerability from a third-party provider, Paradox.ai. As soon as we learned of the issue, we mandated Paradox.ai to remediate the issue immediately, and it was resolved on the same day it was reported to us,” the fast food chain said.

This week, Wall Street is gearing up for the second-quarter earnings season, with major banks and household names like JPMorgan, Bank of America, Johnson & Johnson, and Netflix set to report their financials. Amidst the earnings releases, trade developments, including President Donald Trump's tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, will continue to draw significant attention from investors and financial professionals. The economic calendar is also busy, with inflation and retail sales reports scheduled for release.

Second-Quarter Earnings Season

The earnings season is expected to kick off with a bang, as major U.S. corporations, including banks and pharmaceutical companies, are set to release their financial results. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, among other major banks, will report their earnings, providing insights into the financial health of the banking sector. Johnson & Johnson, a leading pharmaceutical company, is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.66 per share, indicating a decline of 5.7% compared to the year-ago period [3]. Analysts forecast revenues of $22.79 billion, representing an increase of 1.5% year over year.

Trade Developments

The ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. President Donald Trump will continue to be a focal point for investors. The U.S. has implemented tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, which have the potential to disrupt global supply chains and impact corporate earnings. The impact of these tariffs will be closely watched by investors and financial analysts, as they could influence the performance of companies and sectors that are heavily exposed to international trade.

Economic Calendar

The economic calendar is packed with important releases this week. On Tuesday, July 15, the June Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be released, which could provide clues about the future of interest rates. The CPI is expected to show a monthly rise of 0.23% and a year-over-year increase of 2.6% [2]. Additionally, retail sales data will be released on Wednesday, July 16, which will give insights into consumer spending habits.

Conclusion

This week promises to be a busy one for Wall Street, with second-quarter earnings season in full swing and a packed economic calendar. Investors and financial professionals will be closely monitoring the earnings reports and economic data releases to gauge the health of the economy and make informed investment decisions.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate.
Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate.
EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S.
“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.","The U.S. will implement 30% tariffs on imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective Aug. 1, according to letters President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social Saturday morning.

The announcements come amid a rush of country-specific duty proclamations from Trump, covering many of the country's top trading partners, including Canada, Brazil, Japan and South Korea. All tariffs are slated to start Aug. 1.

In his letter to Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump echoed much of the language of his previous missives, including threatening to raise tariffs higher should Mexico retaliate. He also called attention to security topics, like cartel activity within Mexico and its link to U.S. fentanyl trafficking within the letter.

Since early March, imports from Mexico, like those from Canada, have been subject to a 25% tariff unless they qualify for United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement treatment.

The Saturday letter to Mexico does not clarify whether the USMCA exemption will continue under the new tariff rate, nor whether the 35% duty will replace the original 25% levy.

Since the country-specific tariffs were first announced, officials from Mexico have often sought to strengthen the bilateral relationship and secure preferential treatment on tariffs, rather than retaliate. To that end, officials from Mexico met with U.S. counterparts on Friday to establish a permanent working group that would allow the countries to consistently discuss key issues, including flashpoints like security, migration, water management and the economy, according to a press release Saturday.

During that meeting, the U.S. informed Mexico it would send a letter setting new tariffs on Aug. 1, according to the press release, which was issued jointly by Mexico's economy and foreign affairs ministries. Mexico's officials called the action unfair and said they did not agree, but established that one of the working group's first goals would be to seek an alternative prior to the implementation date, according to the release.

“It is highly relevant to have established, since July 11, the necessary channels and space to resolve any possibility of new tariffs going into effect on August 1,” the release says in Spanish. “In other words, Mexico is already in negotiations.”

Trump’s missive to EU President Ursula von der Leyen is also mostly identical to other versions he has shared this week but features a line not included in any previously posted version.

“The European Union will allow complete, open Market Access to the United States, with no Tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit,” the letter says. It is unclear if this is a provision to which the EU has agreed or a request from the president.

EU imports currently face a 10% baseline duty for entering the U.S. The bloc is one of many U.S. trading partners attempting to navigate Trump's tariff-heavy trade policy and negotiate with the White House for reduced duties.

“A 30% tariff on EU exports would hurt businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic. We will continue working towards an agreement by August 1,” von der Leyen said in a post on X Saturday. “At the same time, we are ready to safeguard EU interests on the basis of proportionate countermeasures.”

In May, Trump said talks with the EU ""are going nowhere"" and recommended a 50% tariff on imports from the bloc starting July 9. The president has also threatened tariffs on specific EU-origin products — including wine and champagne — and levied duties targeting major sectors like steel, aluminum and the automotive industry.

Since February, the barrage of U.S.-imposed tariffs have impacted 70% of total EU trade with the U.S., European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech Tuesday.

""The scale and the scope of these measures is unprecedented,"" von der Leyen said. ""Our line has been clear. We will be firm. We do prefer a negotiated solution. This is why we are working closely with the US administration to get an agreement.""

The EU has been preparing its own countermeasures if ongoing tariff negotiations fall short of the bloc's goals. The retaliatory actions would impact more than $100 billion worth of imports and apply to a range of industrial and agricultural products.

1. JPMorgan Chase: The bank is expected to report on its bond portfolio, which has seen significant unrealized losses due to the high interest rate environment. According to S&P Global, JPMorgan Chase holds $22.91 billion in unrealized losses on its held-to-maturity (HTM) securities as of March 31 [3].

2. Citigroup: The bank is also anticipated to report on its HTM securities, with $15.2 billion in unrealized losses [3].

3. Wells Fargo: The bank's HTM securities saw a 12.2% decline year-over-year, with $37.82 billion in unrealized losses [3].

4. Bank of America: The bank had the highest level of unrealized losses on HTM securities at $96.35 billion, a 6.2% decrease year-over-year [3].

5. American Express: The company reported a quarterly revenue of $18.93 billion and a net profit of $2.58 billion. Analysts from Bank of America Securities maintained a Buy rating, while Truist Financial's Brian Foran also issued a Buy rating [1].

Wednesday, July 16:

1. Bank of America: The bank is expected to report on its net interest income (NII) and revenue. Bank of America's NII was $13.7 billion in the second quarter, with optimistic guidance for the latter half of 2024 [2].

2. Goldman Sachs: The investment bank reported a 150% year-over-year increase in second-quarter profits, driven by strong performance in its global banking & markets and asset & wealth management divisions [2].

3. Morgan Stanley: The bank saw a 41% increase in second-quarter profits, with revenue climbing 12% [2].

Thursday, July 17:

1. Netflix: The company is expected to report on its subscriber growth and revenue. Analysts are closely watching for any changes in subscriber numbers and growth projections.

2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC): The company is expected to report on its chip production and revenue. TSMC is a key player in the semiconductor industry, and its earnings report will provide insights into the global chip market.

Friday, July 18:

1. American Express: The company is expected to continue reporting on its financial performance, with analysts maintaining a positive outlook on the stock.

2. Charles Schwab: The brokerage firm is expected to report on its client activity and revenue. Schwab's earnings report will provide insights into the retail brokerage market.

Market Implications:

The upcoming earnings reports will provide valuable information on the financial health of these companies. For instance, the bond portfolios of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America will be closely scrutinized for any signs of improvement or continued losses. Additionally, the NII and revenue reports from Bank of America will offer insights into the bank's consumer banking business. The strong performance of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley indicates a rebound in investment banking activity, which could have broader implications for the financial sector.

Investors should closely monitor these reports and analyze the companies' performance relative to their peers and market expectations. The earnings reports will likely influence market sentiment and could lead to significant price movements in the stocks of these companies.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

The EU exported about 17% of its exportable finished steel products to the US in 2024, according to Comex data.
EU steel product exports remained steady in 2024 year over year, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea data.

The 30% tariffs were announced by US President Donald Trump in letters sent to the presidents of Mexico and the EU, which he posted on Truth Social July 12.

The EU and Mexico are the leading trade partners of the US.

The US is the EU's second-largest export market for steel, while Mexico leads exports of automotive products to the US.

In the letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said Mexico ""still has not stopped the cartels,"" and as a result, the US will start levying the tariffs. However, he added there will be no tariffs on Mexico if it builds or manufactures products in the US.

Similarly, Trump in his letter to EU President Ursula von der Leyen said the US had decided to end its trade deficit with the bloc and would go ahead with the tariffs, unless the EU decides to build or manufacture products in the US.

It was not clear if the current tariffs on Mexico would conflict with exemptions on trade of goods signed under the USMCA trade agreement.

Both letters mentioned that these tariffs are separate from the ""sectoral tariffs"" and any ""good transhipped to evade this higher tariff will be subjected to that higher tariff.""

In the week starting July 7, Trump sent letters to several countries imposing a varied range of tariffs on its key trade partners, including Canada, another key supplier of commodities such as steel, natural gas, and beef.

Metals sector uncertainty

From a metals perspective, the change in tariffs brings uncertainty to steel, aluminum and copper markets, as the US already has a separate 50% tariff on each of these commodities, considered critical for the economy and energy transition.

The 50% tariffs on steel imports and reciprocal tariff threats have led the US construction industry to postpone projects due to uncertainty about prices.

Since the start of 2025, Platts-assessed TSI US HRC EXW Indiana reached a year-to-date high of $950/st on March 12, the day when Trump announced the first round of tariffs. However, prices since those highs have fallen 8.4%, reaching $870/st July 11. Platts is part of S&P Global Commodity Insights.

The EU exported about 17% of its exportable finished steel products to the US in 2024, according to Comex data.

EU steel product exports remained steady in 2024 year over year, according to S&P Global Commodities at Sea data.

From an agricultural perspective, markets in Mexico will be watching for the next developments as the country is a key importer of US corn, pork, chicken and beef.

Mexico also supplies crude oil to the US, while the US is a major supplier of refined products to Mexico.

The US runs its highest trade deficit with Mexico, according to the US Census Bureau.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-13 12:11:08.545014

There are exciting times ahead as we navigate through 2025. Australia’s hotel sector, whilst choppy, continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience with national occupancy rates at 71% and RevPAR up 3.8% to $171. Despite ongoing challenges, this growth creates a landscape ripe with both hurdles and opportunities.

Sydney leads the recovery charge with occupancy at 78% and RevPAR growing to an impressive $215, making this market our standout performer. Conversely, Melbourne and Hobart continue to face headwinds from supply increases and slightly softening domestic leisure demand.

In New Zealand, we see a similar dichotomy—Queenstown, Christchurch, and Rotorua benefit from returning international visitors. Auckland is grappling with increased room inventory, and Wellington is adjusting to reduced government spending.

Third-party management, stakeholder experiences, and technology integration are key trends reshaping our industry. Eco-certified properties are no longer niche but necessary, with major operators prioritising this. The premium/luxury segments continue to expand, particularly with branded residences attracting both domestic and international guests.

The premium and experiential hotel segments present compelling opportunities. Properties offering immersive experiences command premium rates as travellers increasingly value authenticity over standardisation. We’re also seeing strong performance in market mix diversity, where segments combine to offset the ups and downs of current economic and global conditions.

After subdued transaction activity in 2024 ($1.25 billion in transactions to October), we anticipate increased momentum in 2025 as interest rates plateau. While construction costs have tempered new developments, this has heightened the value of existing assets, particularly in supply-constrained markets. In addition, developers are also sourcing creative ways to deliver economically viable hotel projects.

Introducing 60 new international flight routes enhances Australia’s connectivity to key Asian markets, North America, and Europe, further strengthening investment fundamentals for strategically positioned assets.

For Trilogy Hotels, we are excited and optimistic about the future. We remain focused on markets demonstrating strong performance outcomes for owners while selectively exploring opportunities in emerging destinations where we can leverage these evolving consumer preferences and travel patterns.",https://www.hotelmanagement.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Novotel-Sydney-Parramatta-hm.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:35.467697

The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.
Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.
While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.
This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024.","Kraft Heinz has issued a massive recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon over fears of Listeria contamination—a serious foodborne threat that can lead to hospitalization and even death.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the fully cooked turkey bacon was produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025. The potentially contaminated products were distributed nationwide and also shipped to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The affected items include:

12-oz. vacuum-sealed packages with UPC ""071871548601,"" dated between July 18 and August 2 with lot code “RS40”

36-oz. packages (three 12-oz. packs) with UPC “071871548748,” dated July 23 to September 4 and lot codes “RS19,” “RS40,” or “RS42”

48-oz. packages (four 12-oz. packs) with UPC ""071871548793,” dated July 18 to September 4 and lot codes ""RS19,"" ""RS40,"" or ""RS42""

No illnesses have been reported to date, but FSIS warned that the products could still be sitting in home refrigerators or freezers. Consumers are urged not to eat the recalled turkey bacon and to either throw it away or return it to the store where it was purchased.

Listeria monocytogenes, the contaminant in question, is a resilient bacteria that can grow even at refrigerated temperatures.

Infections can cause serious illness, particularly for pregnant women, newborns, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may appear anywhere from a few hours to two months after consuming contaminated food and can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and gastrointestinal distress.

The contamination was discovered through routine internal testing by Kraft Heinz. While no adverse reactions have been linked to the recalled products, FSIS is encouraging anyone concerned about potential illness to seek medical attention.

This recall adds to growing concern over food safety after reports showed a spike in U.S. food recalls and hospitalizations linked to contaminated products in 2024. It also places renewed pressure on major brands like Kraft Heinz to strengthen safety protocols and maintain public trust as consumer scrutiny over labeling and contamination risks intensifies.",https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjE2MTgzMDU5NDMzNjYxODA3/kraft-heinz-reportedly-considers-sale-of-oscar-mayer.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:40.442236

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.
But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage.
Harry Stebbings Founder of 20VC Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves.","Venture capitalist Harry Stebbings faced a wave of backlash in June after urging European startup founders to increase their work hours — but he now admits there's some room for nuance when applying his mantra.

Stebbings, founder of 20VC, a firm managing $650 million in funds, advised founders on LinkedIn last month that ""7 days a week is the required velocity to win right now,"" to compete with startups in Silicon Valley and China.

The post went viral, to Stebbings' surprise, and sparked a debate on whether China's brutal ""996"" work culture — which means working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week — is needed in Europe.

The conversation is rooted in a persistent stereotype that Europe's tech and startup scene is lagging behind the U.S. and China, which have produced trillion-dollar tech giants and are known for implementing long working hours.

The U.S. is home to the biggest tech firms in the world, such as Meta, Google, Amazon, and Apple. China meanwhile houses giants like Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.

""If you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them [Silicon Valley and China], you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Seven founders and VCs shared why they're resisting the 996 push with CNBC Make It at the time.

""What Europe really needs isn't more hustle-porn, it's more aggressive funding,"" Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, said back then.

Speaking to CNBC Make It about the fallout, Stebbings said that he wasn't prepared for the criticism he received, and that his original post didn't apply to the vast majority of people who responded.

""I think it's everything that's wrong with Europe, that backlash,"" Stebbings said. ""We are fighting against companies being built in Silicon Valley, and speed and the ability to move fast, really determines success, in AI especially.""

He added: ""When you go to the Valley now, and when you go to China now, they are working seven days a week in the fastest-growing companies. It's that simple. So, if you want to be a $10 billion company in Europe, competing against them, you can't do it on a nine-to-five, Monday to Friday.""

'We should be working harder than ever'

As companies build more important products, Stebbings said the bar is higher than it used to be.

""We should be working harder than ever because we're working to solve more important problems than ever,"" he said.

But European startups are struggling to access funding at the growth stage. Atomico's State of European Tech report of 2024 showed that, since 2015, Europe's tech startups have missed out on nearly $375 billion in growth-stage funding, with founders losing out on a potential $300 billion in European investments.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day.""

Harry Stebbings

Founder of 20VC

Husmus' Wernér said that the right level of capital is needed for European startups to work intensely without breaking themselves. ""If a team of 10 is burning out to keep up with a 50-person U.S. VC or Chinese government-backed startup, the problem isn't their stamina, it's their cap table.""

However, Stebbings pinned this down to poor marketing and said Europeans aren't great fundraisers compared to their American counterparts. ""I don't think it's a lack of access to cash at all, and in terms of the work ethic there, if you think that you can build a $10 billion business and work five days a week, then I'm sorry to say, you're deluding yourself.""

Some founders have even been ""badly"" advised to include exit slides in their pitches, he added. ""That makes me feel sick, like I'm planning my divorce when I get married.""

In stark contrast, Americans are much better at telling exciting stories when they promote their businesses. ""I think, often in the U.K., we downsize in ambitions.""

996 is 'ignorant'

Ultimately, Stebbings admitted that he jokes with the ""marketing facade"" of 996, but that it's a more nuanced picture than working all the time.

""I think that's [996] very ignorant to do,"" he said. ""if you don't allow people breaks in there and a gym workout, it's just moronic.""

Stebbings said that 100% dedication is essential in the first five years — but that doesn't mean abandoning health, wellness, and family.

""There is nuance. I'm not saying miss dinner with friends or family or just sit at your desk all day, and I'm some horrible person, absolutely not. It's really important to turn off and have a couple of hours away from your computer and just be with friends.""

Stebbings himself tries to spend as much time as possible with his sickly mother, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), including walking a marathon with her every Sunday. He jumps straight back to work after.

But it's unrealistic to expect employees to adopt the same attitude, he acknowledged.

""One of the hardest things about running a company is you will never find someone who cares about it as much as you do, the founder… I think it's unreasonable to ever expect that they will work as hard as you.""

Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, previously told CNBC Make It in June that the focus on hustle culture in the tech industry is about ""a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth.""

He said: ""California is very good at telling stories, and there's a lot of mythmaking around the concept of what startups look like.""

The 10-person study, where patients were observed inpatient for four days and for a week after device removal, met safety and performance endpoints.

CEO Paul Goode said in an interview that the goal of the study was to show that the device and the procedure to implant it were safe.

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. For accuracy, the results showed a mean absolute relative difference of 7.7%, which would make the device competitive with CGMs on the market, although Goode cautioned that the data is very early and the results were not statistically significant. MARD is a measurement that compares blood glucose readings from a CGM to reference measurements, such as blood glucose from a fingerstick.

Glucotrack is taking an implantable device approach to address some of the challenges that people experience with wearable CGMs, Goode said, such as the lag time in readings when blood glucose changes quickly and irritation from adhesives.

“If you look at CGMs, they're wonderful products. Many of us in the company have worked on one or more of those generations of products, and they've done a lot of good for patients with diabetes,” said Goode, who has worked for Dexcom and MiniMed, the diabetes tech business that was later acquired by Medtronic. “That being said, there are still common problems.”

Most continuous glucose monitors on the market today are worn on the skin and measure the concentration of glucose in the interstitial fluid surrounding cells, which is then used to calculate blood glucose values. Glucotrack’s device is different in that it is implanted in the subclavian vein near the collarbone and measures glucose values directly from the blood. Goode said the approach to implantation is similar to a minimally invasive procedure for placing a pacemaker — the CGM is placed two inches into the vein instead of into the heart.

Glucotrack intends for its sensor to last for three years, although it will still need to prove that out in a study.

Senseonics, which currently has the only implantable CGM on the U.S. market, received Food and Drug Administration clearance last year for the device to be worn for a year. Goode said the development is good for patients, adding that he expects Glucotrack’s implant to last longer because of differences in the devices’ placement and chemistry.

Senseonics’ device sits in the upper arm, in the subcutaneous space, “which is the most difficult environment to get something to work,” Goode said, while Glucotrack’s device sits in the bloodstream.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/V_wQW40bpYCa9RLw584LKY1pLw67ElJcAVnaUG1sD1U/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HbHVjb3RyYWNrX2ltcGxhbnQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:53.431193

Creditcorp Expands Inventory Finance to Informal Workers

Emmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia

In a bid to avail the informal sector operators of its services, the Nigerian Consumer Credit Corporation(CREDICORP) has entered into partnership with Sytiamo Technologies to provide affordable credit to 10,000 market women across Nigeria.

The beneficiaries would be spread across 224 markets selected in 28 states with Ariaria International Market, Aba as the starting point.

At the inauguration of the initiative at Aba, the Managing Director of CREDICORP, Mr. Uzoma Nwagba said that it was aimed at expanding financial access to informal sector workers, especially women, who are major drivers of local economies.

“Supporting women with credit is not just a social good; it’s good business,” he said.

Represented by the Executive Director, Credit and Portfolio Management, Mrs Aisha Abdullahi, Nwagba stated that the affordable loans would boost the quality of life and financial inclusion.

He explained the preponderance or women beneficiaries, saying that “women are proven to be better custodians of credit, with higher repayment rates than men”.

“With 66.7% of our executive team and 50% of our management being women, this partnership aligns with our belief that empowering women leads to stronger, more sustainable communities,” he added.

The Managing Director of Sytiamo Technologies, Mr. Michael Ogbaa, explained the rationale for the partnership with CREDICORP, saying that it is the vehicle for delivering affordable credits to market women.

“Through the partnership, we are giving market women quick access to the capital they need to scale up their businesses and improve their livelihoods,” he said.",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/AXAMansard.png,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:20.653324

As tariffs on imports from China, Vietnam, and Bangladesh soar—reaching 69.1%, 20-40%, and 35% respectively—retailers are scrambling to adapt. For companies like Nike (NKE), Ralph Lauren (RL), and Tapestry (TPR), the challenge is twofold: mitigate costs amid spiraling tariffs and preserve margins while competing in a price-sensitive market. This article dissects how these firms are faring, why geographic diversification and pricing power matter, and which stocks investors should prioritize.

The Tariff Tsunami: A Sector Under Siege

The Trump-era tariff regime has reshaped the apparel landscape. China's apparel exports to the U.S. fell 52% year-over-year in May 看不出. Vietnam's tariffs, initially set at 46%, were reduced to 20% after negotiations, while Bangladesh's 35% rate now sits atop existing baseline duties. These shifts have forced retailers to rethink sourcing, production, and pricing.

The stakes are high: U.S. apparel imports from China hit a historic low of 9.9% of market share in 2025, while Vietnam and Bangladesh's roles expanded—but not without costs. For companies reliant on Asian manufacturing, the path to resilience hinges on two pillars: geographic diversification and premium pricing power.

Nike: Pioneering Diversification, Testing Margin Limits

Exposure:

Nike sources 50% of footwear and 28% of apparel from Vietnam, with 18% footwear and 16% apparel from China. The company's $1 billion annual tariff bill underscores the urgency to shift production.

Strategy:

- Supply Chain Shifts: Nike aims to reduce Chinese footwear imports to the “high single-digit range” by 2026, while expanding into Indonesia and Cambodia. It's also exploring Africa, Central America, and Eastern Europe to avoid overconcentration in Southeast Asia.

- Pricing Power:

- Raised U.S. prices, particularly on premium products like Air Jordan sneakers (up to $10 increases).

- Focused on high-margin performance footwear (running, training) over less profitable classics like the Air Force 1.

Risk:

Despite these moves, tariffs outpace mitigation efforts, squeezing margins. Vietnam's labor strikes and infrastructure bottlenecks—echoes of pandemic-era disruptions—add volatility.

Ralph Lauren: The Agile Luxury Play

Exposure:

Ralph Lauren sources 19% of goods from Vietnam and 15% from China, with production spread across five continents. No single region exceeds 20% of its supply chain.

Strategy:

- Geographic Flexibility: Collaborates with global suppliers to reallocate production to low-cost regions while maintaining quality. Expanded facilities in Cambodia and Vietnam reduce China dependency.

- Pricing & Technology:

- Targets less price-sensitive customers, enabling selective price hikes and discount reductions.

- Leverages AI for inventory optimization, reducing waste and aligning production with demand.

Edge:

Ralph Lauren's diversification and tech-driven agility make it a standout. CFO Justin Picicci's emphasis on “real-time supply chain adjustments” positions the firm to weather tariff shocks better than peers.

Tapestry: Quiet Strength in Margin Expansion

Exposure:

70% of Tapestry's production comes from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines. The company has exited China but faces lingering tariff pressures on Asian imports.

Strategy:

- Operational Efficiency:

- Achieved a 280 basis point gross margin expansion in Q2 2025 via operational outperformance (+260 bps) and lower freight costs (+20 bps).

- The Coach brand's premium focus (e.g., higher Average Unit Retail for handbags) drives profitability.

- Tariff Mitigation:

- Anticipated a 10% China tariff as “immaterial,” suggesting supply chain adjustments (e.g., shifting production to tariff-friendly regions) and cost controls neutralize impacts.

Wild Card:

While Tapestry's financials are strong, its reliance on Southeast Asia mirrors Nike's risks. However, its luxury tilt (Coach, Kate Spade) grants pricing flexibility absent in mass-market peers.

Investment Thesis: Overweight Premium, Diversified Players

The tariff landscape favors firms with two traits:

1. Geographic Flexibility: Diversification beyond Vietnam and China (e.g., Nike's forays into Indonesia and Ralph Lauren's global supplier network) reduces overexposure.

2. Pricing Power: Luxury brands like Ralph Lauren and Tapestry's Coach division can pass costs to consumers without losing demand.

Avoid:

- Companies with heavy China reliance or low-margin product lines.

- Firms lacking agility (e.g., overreliance on transshipped goods or inflexible supply chains).

Conclusion: Bet on the Agiles and the Luxe

The apparel sector's winners will be those that turn tariffs into opportunities. Nike's bold diversification and premium pricing, Ralph Lauren's tech-driven adaptability, and Tapestry's margin resilience position them as top picks. Investors should overweight these names while staying cautious on companies lacking both geographic flexibility and pricing leverage.",,N,,2025-07-08 23:59:02.826714

Mozee’s road-legal, 12-passenger electric vehicles aim to close the first- and last-mile transit gap that’s dogged dense urban zones for decades.

Now, the Arlington-based mobility pioneer has partnered with Dallas-based 46 Labs—a 13-year-old global business communications firm that calls itself “the carrier’s carrier”—to provide the backbone that keeps its driverless shuttles connected in real time.

Founded in 2012, 46 Labs operates the Peeredge Orchestration Platform, which handles daily voice and messaging traffic for hundreds of global carriers and Fortune 500 companies. Its infrastructure helps large operators manage multi-vendor networks and maintain service reliability at scale.

46 Labs’ system can track each Mozee shuttle like a separate mobile point, giving the startup real-time visibility as it scales up its mobility operations, according to the announcement. The network could also allow the vehicles to double as roaming hotspots during major events, the companies said.

Modular mobility, assembled in Arlington

Mozee’s AI-powered approach to what it calls “modular agile transit” uses self-driving electric shuttles and real-time route adjustments. The fleet, with vehicles that can travel up to 45 miles per hour, can flex to different needs, so cities, campuses, airports, and venues can adapt to shifting crowds and conditions.

The company said it wants to help cities move beyond the “transportation trap” and rethink how people connect.

“Cities are asking the wrong question,” Mozee wrote in a recent post. “Instead of ‘How do we improve mass transit?’ they should be asking: ‘If 20th-century transit no longer works, how will cities move people in the 21st century?’”

Founded in 2021, Mozee announced its headquarters move from Dallas to Arlington last year, which includes plans for a final assembly plant. The 87,000-square-foot facility is intended to serve as an advanced manufacturing site using 3D printing for some parts before final assembly. The city backed the move with up to $4 million in incentives, and Mozee has pledged more than 100 new jobs with average salaries around $100,000.

Mozee’s first major test bed is Arlington’s Entertainment District, with crowds from Cowboys and Rangers games, concerts, IndyCar races, and, soon, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

“The Entertainment District, with its frequent, high-volume events, offers a real-world setting to demonstrate the convenience and efficiency of our autonomous vehicles,” co-founder Hoyt Fuller told UTA’s The Shorthorn last year. He also noted that Mozee was exploring a potential pilot partnership with UTA focused on V2X, or Vehicle-to-Everything technology.

Networking for scale

Reliable, secure connectivity will be key as Mozee expands its fleet in real-world settings, according to the companies.

“Mozee is reimagining what it means to move through modern cities, and we’re proud to deliver the network foundation that keeps their vehicles connected,” 46 Labs CEO Trevor Francis said in the partnership announcement.

“As mobility continues to evolve, partnerships like this highlight the growing need for reliable infrastructure—built not only for scalability, but to help reshape legacy systems with flexible, future-ready innovation.”

Mozee Co-Founder and CEO Shawn Taikratoke said the partnership helps the company “lead the shift toward smarter, more human-centered mobility.”

The dedicated communications backbone is designed to minimize risk and keep the system running even during broader outages.

“This partnership helps us deliver the power of modular agile transit to meet today’s transit challenges,” Taikratoke said. “We’re proud to find a partner who moves at our speed to ensure our autonomous system remains responsive, secure, and adaptable in a dynamic operating environment.”

For both companies, it’s an example of local tech talent building real-world solutions close to home, with larger ambitions on the horizon.

“As two fast-growing DFW companies, we’re excited to partner to shape the future of mobility right here in North Texas—and scale it globally,” Mozee wrote on LinkedIn.

Once a cornerstone of American banking, Wells Fargo has navigated dramatic highs and lows over its nearly 170-year history. Today, under the unwavering stewardship of CEO Charles Scharf, the $1.93 trillion-asset institution is not just rebuilding trust; it's meticulously modernizing its operations and aggressively refocusing on its core financial services to reclaim its formidable position in the industry.

Charles Scharf's Path to the Helm: The ""Chainsaw Charlie"" Era

Charles Scharf arrived at Wells Fargo in September 2019 with an urgent mandate: to meticulously repair a bank profoundly bruised by scandal. A Harvard College graduate with an MBA from NYU Stern, Scharf forged his executive acumen during pivotal stints at Visa – where he served as CEO from 2012 to 2016 – and at BNY Mellon. His reputation for disciplined cost-cutting, strategic restructuring, and rigorous risk management made him the compelling choice to lead the turnaround after the infamous cross-selling scandal, which had already seen two prior CEOs depart.

Within months, Scharf earned the evocative moniker “Chainsaw Charlie” for his decisive actions, which included eliminating underperforming units and aggressively slashing discretionary spending. This wasn't merely about cutting costs; it was about surgical precision to streamline operations and reallocate resources where they could be most effective. By the end of 2024, the bank’s board unequivocally signaled their confidence, rewarding his efforts with a $31.2 million compensation package – a 7.6 percent increase on the prior year – comprised of a $2.5 million base salary, a $7.2 million cash bonus, and $21.5 million in long-term equity awards. This substantial package underscored the perceived value of his transformative, albeit sometimes challenging, leadership.

Rebuilding Trust and Modernizing Infrastructure: A Cultural Overhaul

Scharf immediately prioritized a fundamental overhaul of core systems and a radical strengthening of internal controls – efforts directly necessitated by the bank’s devastating 2016 fake-accounts scandal. That episode, where employees secretly opened millions of unauthorized customer accounts to meet aggressive sales targets, led to over $3 billion in fines and, critically, a unique seven-year asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve.

Under Scharf, Wells Fargo has poured significant investment into its risk and compliance teams, onboarding thousands of new professionals. They have deployed sophisticated fraud-detection software and, most crucially, meticulously rebuilt its entire sales culture. This monumental shift moved away from purely product-sales metrics towards genuinely rewarding positive customer outcomes. While such sweeping changes inevitably present challenges to employee morale and can feel disruptive, the strategic intent has been to instill a deep-rooted culture of ethical conduct and accountability from the top down. Branch renovations, emphasizing collaborative spaces and digital integration, further signal a tangible commitment to a more customer-centric future.

Core Financial Services: A Strategic Recalibration

Wells Fargo steadfastly remains one of the ""Big Four"" U.S. banks alongside JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. Its primary lines of business continue to generate significant revenue, though a strategic recalibration is underway:

Consumer Banking and Lending: With over 4,100 branches and 13,000 ATMs, this segment remains a cornerstone, serving retail customers with checking, savings, mortgages, and auto loans. While previously a mortgage powerhouse, Wells Fargo is deliberately de-emphasizing home-loan origination in favor of more fee-based businesses, focusing lending more on existing, deep-rooted client relationships.

Wealth and Investment Management: Through Wells Fargo Advisors and Wealth & Investment Management, this segment provides critical financial planning, brokerage services, and trust administration. This capital-light, fee-generating business has been a key focus during the asset cap period and is poised for continued growth.

Commercial Banking: Corporate clients rely on Wells Fargo for comprehensive Treasury management, asset-based lending, and equipment financing. This area is a prime target for expanded deposit-taking and lending now that growth restrictions are lifted.

Wholesale and Investment Banking (Wells Fargo Securities): This division offers underwriting, M&A advisory, and debt capital markets solutions. Having been constrained by the asset cap, this segment is now positioned for significant expansion.

In 2024, the firm reported a robust $82.3 billion in revenue and $19.7 billion in net income, powerfully underscoring a decisive return to profitability and operational stability after years of stifling regulatory constraints. The strong growth in investment banking fees and wealth management income reflects Scharf's strategic pivot towards higher-margin, fee-based businesses.

Turning the Page on Asset Restrictions: A New Growth Trajectory

In a pivotal development in June 2025, the Federal Reserve officially lifted its asset cap, a resounding signal of confidence in Wells Fargo’s extensive reforms and transformed governance. This removal marks the culmination of a painstaking journey and liberates the bank to pursue new growth avenues.

With this significant barrier dissolved, Wells Fargo is now strategically poised to:

Aggressively expand commercial deposits: Attracting new corporate clients and leveraging its vast nationwide footprint.

Reinforce Trading & Capital Markets: Scaling up fixed-income and equity trading desks to regain market share and boost fee income.

Increase lending across core segments: While home lending shifts, the bank can now grow its loan portfolio more broadly, particularly in commercial and investment banking.

This renewed freedom to grow is expected to enhance competitiveness, optimize its balance sheet, and ultimately drive higher returns for shareholders. Investor reaction has been largely positive, with Wells Fargo's stock experiencing a noticeable uplift following the asset cap removal, as analysts now view the bank as ""more than a remediation story."" However, Scharf has cautioned that the bank remains vigilant, with ongoing regulatory consent orders requiring continued focus on risk management. The road ahead demands a delicate balance: seizing growth opportunities while steadfastly maintaining the rigorous controls painstakingly put in place.

What is Wells Fargo CEO’s salary? In 2024, Charles Scharf’s total compensation was $31.2 million, including base pay, cash bonuses, and long-term equity awards, reflecting the board's confidence in his transformative leadership during the bank's turnaround.

Who is the current CEO of Wells Fargo? The current CEO and President is Charles W. Scharf, appointed in September 2019 and specifically charged with leading the post-scandal transformation and rebuilding trust.

What is Wells Fargo known for? Wells Fargo is best known for its extensive branch network, its diversified financial services—ranging from consumer banking to investment management—and its historic role as a ""Big Four"" U.S. bank, now also for its rigorous journey of regulatory compliance and internal reform.

Why is Wells Fargo in trouble? The bank’s reputation suffered severely after the 2016 cross-selling scandal, where employees opened millions of unauthorized accounts to meet sales targets. This crisis led to billions in fines, significant leadership changes, and a Federal Reserve asset cap that lasted until June 2025, from which Charles Scharf has successfully guided the bank's emergence.

Under Charles Scharf’s leadership, Wells Fargo is balancing the pursuit of robust business growth with the disciplined governance and cultural transformation needed to definitively prevent past mistakes from repeating. As it capitalizes on its newfound regulatory freedom, the bank’s enduring success will hinge on maintaining this crucial equilibrium – a testament to its arduous journey from crisis to renewed potential.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-07-09 01:00:31.247376

With over a dozen items affected—including electronics, appliances, food, and automotive products—shoppers are urged to review their recent purchases.

Whether it’s a risk of fire, contamination, or mechanical malfunction, here’s a breakdown of the recalled items and what you need to know if you’ve purchased any of them.

Costco Items on Recall

Anker Power Bank (Model A1257)

Anker has voluntarily recalled certain batches of this power bank due to a potential issue with lithium-ion battery cells that could lead to overheating. Although the likelihood of malfunction is low, customers are advised to stop using the device. Affected customers can receive a free replacement by submitting a photo of the unit with specific details, including the model number and the word “recalled” written on the power bank.

Anker PowerCore 10000 (Model A1263)

This power bank is being recalled due to a risk of overheating, which poses a fire hazard. Anker advises customers to immediately stop using the device and check their website for details on how to receive a replacement or refund.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

Reports have surfaced of weight plates detaching from the handle during use, posing a serious injury risk. Customers should immediately stop using the dumbbells and follow recall procedures for a fix or replacement.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires (Size 235/40R19)

This tire model is missing the required Department of Transportation (DOT) certification marking. While the tires meet performance standards, the lack of a DOT stamp could lead to improper use. Customers are advised to return the product.

Fresh and Ready Prepared Sandwiches and Salads

These ready-to-eat items, sold at Costco Business Centers in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Washington, may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria is a serious health risk, especially for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler

The tow handle on this cooler may cause fingertip injuries, including pinching, crushing, or even amputation. Use of this product should be discontinued immediately until further notice.

Kirkland Signature Severe Cold & Flu (Item #1729556)

A specific lot (P140082) of this over-the-counter medication may contain foreign material due to a manufacturing issue. Distributed to select stores in the Midwest and Southeast, this product should not be used and can be returned to Costco for a full refund.

Midea U-Shaped Window AC Units

Multiple item numbers are involved in this recall due to water pooling inside the unit, which can lead to mold and potentially cause infections or respiratory problems. If you own one of these units, discontinue use and check if your model is included in the recall.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate Tires (Size 185/60R15C)

Michelin is recalling this tire model due to a failure to meet federal safety standards for endurance. Sections of tread rubber may detach from the tire shoulder, increasing the risk of an accident. Drivers should stop using these tires and contact Michelin for replacement.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer

Certain models have been found to allow the pressure lid to open while the unit is still pressurized, potentially causing severe burns. Consumers should avoid using the pressure cooking function until a replacement lid is received.

Segway Ninebot Electric Kickscooter (Item #1567456)

This scooter model may suffer from a folding mechanism failure, which poses a risk of falling. Owners are instructed not to use the scooter until they have received and installed a free repair kit.

Sublue Underwater Scooter

Battery packs in Sublue Mix models manufactured between June 2018 and March 2024 have a risk of overheating and catching fire. Affected models include MIXAW01, MIXAB01, and MIXSB01. A free battery replacement program is in place, and users are advised to stop using the devices immediately.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18-Pack

Some lots sold in Texas and Louisiana may be contaminated with pseudomonas bacteria, which occur naturally in water but can pose a health risk to individuals with weakened immune systems. Affected customers should not consume the product.

What You Should Do

If you’ve purchased any of these items, check your receipts or order history to confirm. Visit Costco’s official recall page for instructions on how to return or replace affected products. In most cases, you’ll receive a full refund or free replacement. Taking quick action can help prevent safety issues for you and your household.

Publicis as a platform Gaming, per Tonelli, is emerging as another channel alongside creators and influencers that Publicis Groupe has identified as major audience reach alternatives to TV and legacy media.
Those companies are technology and data operations, and they own all of their media inventory,” said Gaines.","Super bowled

Publicis Groupe’s ambitions were clinical and clear during the Cannes Lions festival last month where it launched an all-out challenge to TV’s untouchable – the Super Bowl.

The French marketing services group, which is outperforming its global holding company peers in the equity markets, launched a real-time campaign during the Cannes Lions challenging the Super Bowl by showing it can build the audience reach of one $8m Superbowl TV ad – with 127 million viewers – in a 24 hour window for somewhere between 5-25 per cent of the cost using influencers and creators.

The holdco has outlaid an estimated $650m in the past 12 months acquiring creator-influencer platforms - Captiv8 and Influencer – which it is wiring up to its consumer identity and targeting engine, CoreID, housed in data unit Epsilon, which it acquired in 2019 for upwards of $4bn. Publicis Group also acquired Australian-founded global retail media ad platform, Citrus Ad, in 2021 for $205m and locally it paid an estimated $30-40m for independent media agency Atomic 212° last December, announcing the deal the following month.

Next on Publicis' agenda to build out its legacy media eating audience ecosystem and compete with the global tech-media giants, which dominated the sprawling beachfront showcase instalments in Cannes last month, is gaming.

Big names and games

Zenith ANZ CEO Jason Tonelli told a breakfast briefing in Cannes last month, put on by iion, a specialist programmatic gaming adtech player. The firm houses tier one titles such as Call of Duty, Minecraft, Fortnite, FIFA and GTA – used by brands like L’Oreal, KFC, Lego, Samsung, Ikea and Coca-Cola to target the 1.4bn global gamers on iion’s “unified” platform.

Advertisers have jumped into the tech-media platforms because of their enormous scale and ability to allow easy access and targeting of their users, who leave an abundant trail of personal data captured and monetised by the global players. Gaming, however, has been sidelined for a decade despite a huge, highly-engaged user base.

Community and connections

Citing Zenith’s Australian single source consumer research panel, Tonelli said 78 per cent of gamers were playing every week, 28 per cent daily. “When you think about that from an Australian perspective, 56 per cent of Australians are watching television every day, so you're starting to see where this reach shift is starting to play,"" Tonelli said. “It's a lean-in environment, and we're all advocates for the gaming industry here. You're not leaning back. You're engaged in it. So there's connection and community – all those things are really important when you think about community, when you think about fandom, when you think about engagement, and when you think about attention – gaming delivers that. So now, with some data behind it, it's got scale.”

Unified programmatic games

“We’ve been talking about insurance here [at the Cannes session], we've got insurance clients too. When I start to think about insurance, where are young people? 18-24 year-olds for health insurance, car insurance etc, where are they going? They're going to social right now to be educated about insurance, they are not going to their parents like we did. And in social they’re using influencers or ChatGPT. But there's a wonderful opportunity if you think creatively about gaming and how health insurance plays a role. So what we need to do is be creative about how that solves problems for the consumer that's using those things.”

Tonelli said iion was the first time a programmatic platform had properly unified the disparate gaming sector to launch campaigns across multiple publishers with the IAB measurement standards in viewability and attention – iion, for instance, incorporates attention metrics from Amplified Intelligence in its reporting.

Publicis as a platform

Gaming, per Tonelli, is emerging as another channel alongside creators and influencers that Publicis Groupe has identified as major audience reach alternatives to TV and legacy media.

“It's quite interesting. I think when you start to consider some of our strategic acquisitions … when you think about Influential, Captiv8 and Epsilon, you start to see how we're helping our clients really build reach, build scale, and really think about identity as a solution,” Tonelli said.

“Some of the big conversations you're getting out of Cannes at the moment are really around experiences and engagement as well as efficiencies. And when you start to put those things together, I think influencers and gaming have a massive role in delivering those three things.""

Building out those platforms affords holdco agencies a greater degree of protection from their platform rivals now openly telling brands they can hand over budgets and outcomes and let their algorithms do the rest.

Some ex-holdco global execs think becoming platforms in their own right is perhaps the major networks' only hope of long-term survival. Dave Gaines, a former GroupM and WPP global exec turned founder at independent agency Media by Mother, holds that view.,

“49 per cent of the money in the [advertising] world goes to Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. Those companies are technology and data operations, and they own all of their media inventory,” said Gaines.

“All of the big holding companies are effectively trying to replicate that model. They're just trying to mirror those three large companies in order that they can compete and big clients, certainly in the US when you pitch, they come looking for those kind of things ... Alphabet, Meta and Amazon have reshaped the way that media is delivered.""",http://www.mi-3.com.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/Jason%20Tonelli%20-%20Lead%20Image%204.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:23.478222

A NEW HORIZON: Monument Advocacy is merging with Horizon Government Affairs, gaining a major boost in health care lobbying firepower in the firm’s first big private equity-fueled acquisition.

— Horizon pulled in $1.7 million in lobbying revenues last year for work on behalf of clients including PhRMA and McKesson as well as industry coalitions including the Health Innovation Alliance. Horizon and its staff will be folded into Monument, which brought in $14.5 million in lobbying fees last year from clients including Amazon, Starbucks, Waymo, Netflix, Albertsons, Alaska Airlines, Zillow and the Consumer Brands Association.

— The merger will give the combined firm a larger platform with which it can capitalize on the growing overlap between the tech and health care sectors on issues like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, John Murray, Monument’s chief executive, said in an interview.

— “For me, in terms of our strategy at Monument, health care has always been number one on my list” of acquisition targets, he added. “It’s an important part of the business, and there’s so much opportunity to cross-pollinate with our tech practice and our public affairs practice in particular.”

— That’s especially true now, with sweeping change coming to the sector as part of Republicans’ megabill, which is now law. “All of the health care pieces that are in the reconciliation bill now have to be implemented,” said Murray. “There’s a long road still to make tweaks and advocate on behalf of clients who want to continue to be a part of that process.”

— The combined firm will also be well-positioned to work on issues related to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “Make America Healthy Again” movement by drawing on Monument’s active food and agriculture practice and Horizon’s health expertise. “We see that as a huge opportunity,” Murray told PI.

— Murray called the Horizon merger the “first piece of a multi-pronged business strategy” powered by an investment last year from Boston-based Everlane Equity Partners. For Monument’s next expansion, Murray said the firm is eyeing a presence in California, New York, Texas and Florida in addition to more financial services capabilities in D.C.

BUSTOS LOBBYING FOR OPENAI: Former Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) has registered to lobby for OpenAI as the ChatGPT maker continues to grow its lobbying footprint. Bustos, who’s now a partner at Mercury Public Affairs, began lobbying for the AI giant back in May on issues related to AI policy, along with her son Nick Bustos, who’s also at Mercury, according to a disclosure filing.

— OpenAI has quickly ramped up its advocacy operations in Washington, where the firm dropped more than $1.7 million on lobbying last year. OpenAI retains three other outside firms — Miller Strategies, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and DLA Piper — in addition to its team of in-house lobbyists, but Bustos is the only former member of Congress currently lobbying for the company as it presses for a light-handed approach to regulating AI.

FIRST IN PI — FETTERMAN CHIEF HANGS A SHINGLE: Krysta Juris, who most recently served as chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), has returned to K Street to launch Two Lights Strategies, a government relations and public affairs firm.

— Juris spent nearly a decade working for the late Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid before joining the lobbying firm Subject Matter (now Avoq). She then moved over to public policy roles at Meta and Stripe before heading back to the Hill in 2023 to serve as deputy chief of staff and then chief of staff to Fetterman.

— Juris said in an email that she struck out on her own for a “more focused, hands-on approach” to advocacy. “Starting my own firm allows me to work closely with a smaller group of clients across sectors and bring the full weight of my experience to each engagement,” she wrote.

LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP AT AVOQ: Nicole Cornish is stepping down as chief executive of Avoq after eight years with the lobbying and public affairs firm, per PRovoke Media’s Paul Holmes. During Cornish’s tenure as CEO, the firm (then Subject Matter) scored an investment from Los Angeles-based private equity firm Coral Tree Partners, which enabled its acquisition of the PR shop Kivvit a year later. The merged firm rebranded as Avoq not long after.

— Cornish, who will step down at the end of the year, plans to “remain on the board and actively support a seamless leadership transition and continue to provide ongoing strategic guidance as the firm moves forward,” according to the firm.

FLYING IN: Nearly three dozen retailers are in town today for the National Retail Federation’s latest fly-in on tariff issues. The delegation was set to meet with around 60 offices on the Hill in addition to meeting with majority and minority staff for the House Small Business Committee and Senate Finance Committee, senior officials at the Treasury Department and representatives from the Small Business Administration.

— This is NRF’s fourth fly-in in as many months focused on illustrating the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs — to say nothing of the uncertainty caused by the administration’s constantly shifting goalposts and deadlines — on the retail industry.

SPEAK NOW: “The I.R.S. said on Monday that churches and other houses of worship can endorse political candidates to their congregations, carving out an exemption in a decades-old ban on political activity by tax-exempt nonprofits,” The New York Times’ David Farenthold reports.

— The statement, made in a court filing, “seemed to formalize what already seemed to be the agency’s unspoken policy,” but it follows a yearslong push by Trump to revoke the so-called Johnson Amendment. “The National Council of Nonprofits, which represents 30,000 such groups, warned that allowing tax-exempt groups to endorse candidates could lead to a future where political groups use nonprofits as a kind of legal disguise,” per the NYT.

— The IRS’ shift is “not about religion or free speech, but about radically altering campaign finance laws,” the council’s president, Diane Yentel, argued in a statement. “The decree could open the floodgates for political operatives to funnel money to their preferred candidates while receiving generous tax breaks at the expense of taxpayers who may not share those views.”

FIRST IN PI II – AUSTIN DODGES SPECIFICS ON CONSULTING FIRM: Former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is defending himself from charges of influence peddling lodged at him by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) but didn’t answer most of their specific questions about his new consulting firm in a response obtained by Daniel.

— He told them in a letter sent on Tuesday that he “will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards” and “will abide by all relevant post-government restrictions and ethics pledges.” He said in the letter that he doesn’t lobby and won’t lobby in the future. During his confirmation process, Austin had pledged to not lobby after his tenure as defense secretary but the senators believe that his new D.C. strategic advisory firm doesn’t live up to the spirit of his promise.

— He didn’t answer whether he would help clients in “making communications [to] or appearances” in front of the Defense Department, whether he would work for foreign governments or entities, whether he’d recuse himself from issues he worked with as defense secretary, which clients he is working for and if they’ve had contracts with the Pentagon, among other questions. “At our firm, we believe that there’s no substitute for integrity, honesty, candor, discretion, and the highest quality of work,” he told Warren and Scott.

— “It’s extremely disappointing that Secretary Austin has undermined the public trust and refused to answer simple questions about his lucrative new role,” Warren said in a statement to PI. “At the very least, Secretary Austin should stop dodging our questions and be transparent with the American people. I will continue fighting to close the revolving door and root out corruption.”

— A spokesperson for Austin declined to comment. A spokesperson for Scott didn’t immediately have a comment on how he planned to try to get the answers he and Warren want.

In the last few months alone, we’ve seen Unilever dedicate half of its ad budget to social channels in an “influencer first” push, Publicis Groupe acquired Captiv8, and WPP created an entire influencer function for L’Oreal.

These shifts in the industry aren’t coincidental. The influencer marketing sector is projected to reach a global market size of $32.55 billion by 2025. Spurred by a seismic change in how consumers interact with media, 92 percent of consumers trust influencer recommendations over traditional advertising, and influencer campaigns led to a 24 percent increase in brand credibility.

As a result of this, brands are finding that micro and nano creators (i.e., those with smaller but highly engaged audiences) are proving particularly effective in creating authentic connections. This allows brands of all sizes to access scalable, credible storytelling. And businesses of all sizes are looking to tap into this channel, earning $6.50 for every $1 spent on influencer marketing, with the top 13 percent earning $20 or more, according to a recent survey by Tomoson. Influencer marketing is proving not only influential but measurably impactful.

AI as a Transformative Force in Campaign Optimization

Artificial intelligence is redefining how brands approach influencer marketing, offering a salve to the industry’s biggest Achilles heel: poor scalability. Typically, influencer programs struggled to keep pace with budgets. Every extra dollar dedicated to influencer budgets meant an extra dollar needed on the headcount to service that budget. Cataloging posts, identifying trends, reporting, managing approvals … every step required human engagement.

Related story: From Influence to Intelligence: The Rise of AI-Driven Creator Commerce

AI solves this issue by analyzing millions of posts in seconds. It can recommend the most effective formats, posting times, caption lengths, and even aesthetic elements tailored to specific audiences. Perhaps most critically, AI enables more advanced performance measurement. Sentiment analysis tools now assess emotional resonance and track shifts in brand perception, offering brands a more nuanced understanding of campaign impact than surface-level metrics alone can provide.

Not All AI is Created Equal

So the answer is simple, use AI right? Not quite. Not all AI models are created equal, and this point is especially pertinent for retailers. AI is only as good as the data it’s trained on. If you’re using ChatGPT or an off-the-shelf equivalent, you’ll just get generic outputs. With retailers relying more heavily on a blend of influencer sizes than other sectors, this tailored information is crucial to ensuring campaign success. Retailers typically have more activations throughout the year than other industries, which adds even more complications. More influencers, used more frequently, to activate more campaigns.

A Move Toward Long-Term Strategic Partnerships

Tied to this is the move from transactional, one-off campaigns to long-term, strategic partnerships. These ongoing relationships help build audience trust through repeated exposure to a consistent brand voice, making the content feel more authentic and less opportunistic. A familiar creator whose brand reinforces the values and message of your own is like gold dust.

Long-term collaborations are often more cost effective, with better rates negotiated across multiple activations. Plus, creators who understand a brand deeply can deliver more informed, compelling content. Strategically, these partnerships allow brands to develop ongoing narrative arcs, using a trusted voice to communicate different aspects of their value over time rather than relying on fragmented, one-off messages from multiple influencers.

As influencer marketing continues to evolve, brands that adopt AI-powered tools, spread their presence across platforms, and cultivate long-term creator partnerships will be best equipped to connect authentically with audiences and adapt to ongoing change in the space.",https://network.napco.com/total-retail/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2022/05/GettyImages-1153698496.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:02:02.647038

Those levies range roughly from 25% to 40%.

Here is a breakdown on the potential tariff exposure for U.S. consumer apparel and footwear companies, based on where their manufacturing operations are located.

RALPH LAUREN:

Ralph Lauren produces most of its goods outside the United States, with about 19% from Vietnam and 15% from China, according to an April Raymond James report. The company said in May that supply chain is diversified enough to allow it to deal with supply disruptions.

NIKE:

Nike imported about 43% of its goods into the United States, according to Raymond James. Its sports footwear manufacturing is 50% from Vietnam, 27% from Indonesia, and 18% from China, according to Bernstein analysts. Sports apparel production breaks down as follows: 28% from Vietnam, 16% from China, and 15% from Cambodia. The company in June said it would allocate production differently to try to deal with the tariffs.

SKECHERS:

Skechers sources about 40% of its products from both China and Vietnam, according to Raymond James. The company has been redirecting imports away from China and relocating some production.

CAPRI:

Capri’s Michael Kors line is mostly produced in Asia, while Italy is its primary production source for Jimmy Choo. The company has been expanding production in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Cambodia.

TAPESTRY:

Tapestry’s sources primarily from Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Philippines, which combined represent about 70% of its production, the company noted in its May earnings release.

AMERICAN EAGLE:

American Eagle sources primarily in Asia, Raymond James wrote. The company is reducing its sourcing from China in 2025.

ABERCROMBIE & FITCH:

Abercrombie & Fitch’s sourcing was as follows: 35% from Vietnam, 22% from Cambodia, 12% from India, 7% from China, and 25% “other” in fiscal year 2024, according to Raymond James.

LULULEMON:

Lululemon fabric sourcing is 35% from Taiwan, 28% from China, 11% from South Korea, according to Raymond James analysts. Manufacturing is 40% Vietnam, 17% Cambodia, 11% Sri Lanka, 11% Indonesia, 7% Bangladesh.

WASHINGTON, July 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Allegiant Air pilots represented by Teamsters Local 2118 are raising serious questions about Allegiant's leadership after the company this week sold its failed Sunseeker Resort while continuing to stall contract negotiations for 1,400 union pilots.

The airline claims the sale of its unsuccessful hotel project signals a renewed focus on its core airline operations, but their actions tell a different story.

""Allegiant's executives have wasted billions on failed side hustles while refusing to fairly pay the pilots who actually keep this carrier in the air,"" said Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien. ""Allegiant owes our members over $200 million in hard-earned retention bonuses. The Teamsters demand accountability and a fair contract now from this greedy, corruptible employer.""

Allegiant pilots have been stuck in negotiations for over four years. While others across the airline industry have secured pay increases and improved working conditions in recent years, Allegiant has refused to pay industry standard wages and is asking pilots to make concessions on quality of life and scheduling issues.

Since March 2021, Allegiant's market value has decreased by 78 percent, with a current market cap of $1.3 billion. The company lost $520 million on the sale of its ill-fated Sunseeker Resort, which is equal to over half of the company's current market value. The sale of the South Florida hotel follows a pattern of frivolous spending by the airline. With impractical ventures outside its core airline operations, from sports stadiums to luxury hotels and golf courses, Allegiant has burned millions of dollars on corporate pet projects.

Corporate financial mismanagement has left the company ill-equipped to resolve outstanding contract negotiations for pilots, but the Teamsters continue to call on Allegiant to return to the bargaining table.

""Management at Allegiant has no ability to lead this company. They have no allegiance to the hardworking, dedicated pilots,"" said Greg Unterseher, Teamsters Airline Division Director, Above-the-Wing. ""The Teamsters Union has zero confidence that Allegiant will bargain in good faith, but this company must be held to account.

Off-platform push Retail media is seemingly hitting its maturation curve.
Is the retailer to own that strategy and provide it as a managed service or is the advertiser in control of the off-platform media?
Test and learn fatigue While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.","Either RMNs deliver or advertisers pull back spend.

“This year, you’re starting to see more streamlining, more material partnerships start to transpire because [RMNs] understand that having the data alone is not the full story,” said Deanna Mulkeen, head of media investment at Wpromote. The full story, she added, is “data, scaled inventory, reach and eyeballs all through to closed loop measurement.”

Media buyers are focused on total commerce strategies, full-funnel measurement and total transparency in the off-platform push. Amazon may still rule the roost with its data and ad ecosystem, but other players like Walmart and Instacart are working to close the gap, media buyers told Digiday.

Here’s a look at how the retail media landscape is shaping up in the second half of the year:

Amazon and the AMC ‘Holy Grail’

In the retail media network arms race, there seems to be Amazon and then everyone else. According to media buyers, that’s because of the tech giant’s sheer scale, first-party data, and its demand-side platform (DSP) that’s been catching the eye of non-endemic advertisers. More comparisons are being made between Amazon’s DSP to DSPs like Trade Desk or DV360, per Mulkeen.

Amazon Marketing Cloud, however, seems to be “the glue” connecting top and bottom of funnel media, said Damien Bianchi, group media director of retail media and commerce at VML. That full-funnel effect is what retail media networks have been vying for in the push to off-site media, taking RMNs beyond on-clicks and ROAS to deeper, long-term business goals, like household penetration and customer lifetime value, Bianchi added.

“If you’re taking advantage of it correctly, you’ll know exactly what type of Amazon media to serve specific cohorts at very specific times of the year,” he said.

But Walmart and Instacart are still making a play for their share of the full-funnel ad spend and were among the flurry of announcements during Cannes inking partnerships around measurement and off-platform ads.

Blurring budget lines

Internally, brand budget lines are also blurring as retailers push to become full-funnel media channels. Historically, dollars were siloed — either labeled shopper marketing spend or national media spend, per the three media buyers Digiday spoke with for this story. But the type of spend is changing as RMNs expand their capabilities beyond search and display ads on site to encompass video, streaming and social commerce.

It’s less that dollars are being shifted from one budget to another, and more that brands are unifying brand and performance budgets.

“We’re not seeing dollars being pulled out of existing brand building campaigns just yet,” said Anthony Costanzo, chief analytics officer at Mile Marker, an independent media agency.

Off-platform push

Retail media is seemingly hitting its maturation curve. Retailers inked partnerships with streaming services, social media platforms and other third-party partners to extend media capabilities beyond their owned-and-operated channels.

But as much as the space has grown up, buyers say there’s more to go and they’re still left with questions : Who controls access to the inventory? Who controls access to the audiences and delivery of the media strategies? Is the retailer to own that strategy and provide it as a managed service or is the advertiser in control of the off-platform media?

To help get advertisers over the hurdle, retailers are offering incentives, like co-funding (or dollar matching programs) off-platform investments, opportunities to test new ad formats, dedicated resourcing support and, perhaps most importantly, measurement, per Costanzo. The latter is especially true for larger players in the space who have droves of data and insights, he added.

“Measurement is being used as an incentive for a lot of these partnerships, because it’s something that’s in such high demand,” Costanzo said.

Test and learn fatigue

While Amazon holds a strong foothold in the retail media space — with the likes of Walmart trailing not too far behind — other retail media networks are working to prove their own unique value propositions.

Whether advertisers buy into it comes down to sales as the appetite for testing and learning — especially as economic uncertainty looms — is shrinking, said Bianchi.

He added, “If brands are able to effectively create awareness and move product, move SKUs at a very effective rate on the bigger retailers right now, there’s not what I would call a compelling reason to do test and learns on smaller retailers unless there’s some kind of incentive.”

Heading into the second half of the year, retail media’s trajectory is likely one of more investment, but also more scrutiny and pressure to deliver at parity with the broader digital media ecosystem — think Meta and Google.

“This industry loves to talk about measurement, but in reality, there’s so much more sophistication that can be realized,” said Wpromote’s Mulkeen.",https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/retail-network-digiday_b0a4ee.gif,N,,2025-07-08 19:08:02.140340

Publicis Groupe digital agency Razorfish confirmed today that agency veteran Dani Mariano has been promoted to US CEO, succeeding Josh Campo.

Campo had led the agency for five years, originally joining Publicis when the holding company acquired Sapient in 2015.

No official word on Campo’s next move but sources indicated that he is rumored to be headed to Huge as CEO. Late last year Huge was sold by Interpublic Group to AEA Investors, which merged the agency with Hero Digital. Huge was the surviving brand and Huge CEO Lisa De Bonis continued to lead the combined agency.

In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028.","(NewsNation) — Major American brands have vowed to remove synthetic food dyes from their products, but M&M’s and Skittles, made by Mars, remain colorful holdouts.

Mars has continued to use synthetic dyes in its candies after backing off a 2016 plan to remove all artificial colors from its food portfolio.

The company reversed course after it found that consumer attitudes varied by country, with Europeans largely opposed to synthetic dyes, while others preferred artificially colored treats, according to the Mars website.

Synthetic dyes have come under fire recently from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who wants them removed from the nation’s food supply over potential health risks.

Some research has linked the dyes to behavioral health issues in children and places like Australia, Canada and the European Union generally have tighter restrictions on their use.

Despite those concerns, synthetic dyes remain widespread, appearing in nearly 1 in 5 packaged foods and beverages on U.S. grocery shelves, according to a recent study.

That study, published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that confectionery companies had the most products containing synthetic dyes.

The National Confectioners Association, a candy industry trade group, criticized the study, accusing the authors of having “major gaps in their analysis.” The NCA argued that chocolate and candy differ from other foods because Americans eat them less frequently, only two to three times per week.

Both Skittles and M&M’s list several synthetic dyes on their ingredient labels, including common dyes like Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. Mars did not respond to NewsNation’s request for comment on Tuesday.

So far, Kennedy has favored the carrot over the stick, encouraging companies to voluntarily phase out synthetic dyes rather than pushing for major changes in federal regulation. Recent announcements suggest the approach is gaining traction.

Food giants like Kraft Heinz, General Mills, PepsiCo, Nestle and ConAgra have all unveiled plans to move away from artificial colors in their U.S. products. The question is whether they’ll follow through.

Thomas Galligan, principal scientist for food additives at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, has expressed skepticism, noting that many companies have failed to keep similar promises in the past.

“If the FDA were to require warning labels on synthetically dyed foods, similar to the rule in place since 2010 in the European Union, there would be a much stronger incentive for industry to reformulate,” Galligan said in a recent statement.

Several states have taken matters into their own hands, passing legislation restricting synthetic dyes. In West Virginia, most artificial food dyes will be banned starting in 2028. California and Virginia have banned six artificial dyes from school food.

Meanwhile, beginning in 2027, Texas will require warning labels on foods or beverages made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives.

“We follow and will continue to follow regulatory guidance from the authorities in this space because consumer safety is our chief responsibility and priority,” the National Confectioners Association said in an April statement responding to Kennedy’s push to phase out synthetic food dyes.

While several artificial dyes remain, Mars has removed another controversial additive, titanium dioxide, from Skittles.

The chemical, which helps make candy appear shiny, was removed from all Skittles production at the end of last year, the company confirmed to Bloomberg in May. The ingredient was already banned in the European Union in 2022 over possible health risks.

According to its website, Mars is still committed to avoiding synthetic colors in its dinnertime foods.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/07/GettyImages-911654750.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-08 21:03:49.693108

Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.
At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency.
But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.
The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns.","AHIP, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association recently announced a set of “voluntary commitments” to “streamline” prior authorization and “improve patient outcomes.” Major insurers including Aetna, Centene, Cigna, Elevance Health, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare have signed on.

These commitments appear to put more guardrails on how insurers use prior authorization. In reality, they largely repeat existing obligations and may simply be a strategic attempt to deflect growing public criticism of insurers’ abuse of prior authorization to deny or delay care.

These commitments were developed during a roundtable hosted by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Notably, it’s unclear whether any consumers, consumer groups, or provider associations participated in shaping them. Any lack of broad stakeholder representation raises concerns about whether the commitments reflect the interests of the people most affected by prior authorization policies.

AHIP also released a policy brief to accompany the announcement, reasserting the importance of prior authorization as a tool for reducing “unnecessary” health care spending and as a “critical safeguard in patient care.” Yet, a large and growing body of research shows that prior authorization is a primary way insurers control costs while tripping up beneficiaries in red tape. This misrepresentation of harm calls into question the credibility of the initiative as whole.

Against that backdrop, a closer look at the commitments reveals that several simply echo the existing requirements already baked into federal regulation, including in the CMS Interoperability and Prior Authorization Rule (“Rule”) finalized in January 2024. For example, the pledge to adopt FHIR-based technology for electronic submission by January 1, 2027, is not new. That deadline is already mandated under the Rule for many plans. Likewise, the promise to improve transparency by explaining denials in plain language and providing appeal guidance simply restates baseline requirements found in the Rule and required by the Affordable Care Act.

While some commitments mirror existing requirements that lend a degree of accountability (if enforced), other so-called “new” commitments totally lack meaningful oversight or accountability, relying entirely on voluntary compliance. For example, the pledge to reduce prior authorization volume by 2026 only “as appropriate” for each plan’s local market lets insurers set their own goals without standards, oversight, or consequences. These kinds of statements may sound patient-centered, but are meaningless without regulatory oversight. Another commitment – to have clinicians review denials – is already described by AHIP as an industry-wide “existing norm.” Even if that is true, there is no standard requiring plans to disclose who is making decisions, leaving consumers in the dark and unable to know whether the promise is actually being followed.

These same corporations made similar promises in 2018 and again in 2023. At the time, they vowed to reduce prior authorization and increase transparency. But without any enforcement, those promises went nowhere and the volume of prior authorization increased.

Other commitments are more limited than they appear. The pledge to honor existing authorizations for 90 days when a member switches plans only applies if the person has already started the approved course of treatment and only if the benefit is covered and provider is in-network under the new plan. That’s far from a robust continuity of care guarantee.

The commitment to process 80% of prior authorization requests in “real time” by 2027 also raises concerns. It lacks a clear definition of “real time” and creates incentives for speed over careful, individualized review. In practice, efforts to accelerate processing often rely on overworked clinicians or algorithmic tools that cut corners. A former Cigna medical director, for example, said that she and other doctors were pressured to rush through claim reviews without fully examining patient records. Her superiors were “more concerned about being fast than being right.” We have already seen how automation and AI tools can contribute to opaque, inconsistent, and clinically inappropriate denials. AHIP claims AI isn’t used to deny care without clinician input, but mounting evidence shows otherwise. Without meaningful guardrails, transparency, or independent oversight, this pledge risks increased reliance on the very technologies that have undermined trust in prior authorization.",https://healthlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/prior-authorization.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:58:47.851107

TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — If you’re a Costco shopper, you may want to check your home for a few items the company recently recalled. Affected products include tires, power banks and air conditioners.

Consumers should stop using some of the products immediately, Costco said.

The following products were recalled:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257

This Anker Power Bank recall concerns a “potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells,” according to Anker. Though the company says the likelihood of a malfunction is “minimal,” consumers should stop using the device immediately.

Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank — Model A1263

The Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank recall was issued over concerns it may overheat and pose a potential fire risk. The product was sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022.

Danby 8,000 BTU U-Shaped Window Air Conditioner — Model DAC080B6IWB-6

This Danby air conditioner recall was issued after it was discovered that the units can fail to drain water quickly enough, allowing water to pool — and may potentially lead to mold growth. The air conditioner was sold between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022. If you have one, Danby said to stop using it immediately.

This Midea air conditioner recall is the same as the Danby recall above, as Midea supplies air conditioner models under different brand names. The product was also recalled over potential mold growth concerns. It was sold between June 2021 and May 2025.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

Bridgestone said these tires “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements.” The company explains these tires were only sold as replacement equipment. The tires were manufactured June 2-22, 2024. Bridgestone explains customers can examine tires for four particular markings to determine if their tires are under recall. Tires must have all four markings, says Bridgestone. These are: 1) “Bridgestone” brand marking 2) “Blizzak 6” marking on tire line 3) “235/40R19” tire size marking and tire identification numbers of 1VR100W122224, 1VR100W122324, or 1VR100W100W122424.

Tires should not bear a “DOT” marking, says Bridgestone. The company adds that any tires reading “Blizzak LM005” are not included in the Blizzak 6 tire recall. Bridgestone says the tires can be replaced for free through Nov. 12.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

Michelin said these tires fail to meet a federal safety standard for tire endurance, and “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.” The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires recall only includes tires in the 185/60R15C size. The affected tires can be identified by their DOT sidewall markings, which will include dimension information, ID numbers and DOT start/stop dates, which can all be found in the recall notice. Michelin says replacement tires will be offered through Jul 1, 2026.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

Illinois Tech Professor of Food Science and Nutrition Indika Edirisinghe says it was time for the food and beverage industry to reevaluate the use of artificial dyes in their products, but he also warns that switching over to natural food dye doesn’t come without challenges.
“One of the big challenges with the natural color is stability and consistency—they are not as stable as artificial colors,” says Edirisinghe.
In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.
Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.","The color of your morning bowl of Froot Loops is about to change.

Major manufacturers including Nestle, General Mills, and Kraft Heinz have announced that they will be removing artificial dyes from their products within the next two years.

Illinois Tech Professor of Food Science and Nutrition Indika Edirisinghe says it was time for the food and beverage industry to reevaluate the use of artificial dyes in their products, but he also warns that switching over to natural food dye doesn’t come without challenges.

“One of the big challenges with the natural color is stability and consistency—they are not as stable as artificial colors,” says Edirisinghe. “Their lifespan is maybe weeks or a few months. Over time, they may degrade when exposed to environmental factors such as heat and light, resulting in discoloration. That’s going to be a challenge.”

Though Nestle says more than 90 percent of its current product categories do not contain synthetic colors, most of the products in the food industry that still do use them are targeted toward children—think breakfast cereals and sweets.

With some safety regulations having taken effect decades ago, Edirisinghe says that he thinks it’s the right time for the industry to take another look at those standards.

In particular, Edirisinghe points to a 2021 study that linked synthetic food dyes to an increase in children and adolescents being diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as evidence that the industry needed to reassess those dyes.

“In the last 20 years, the rate [of children with ADHD] has increased from 6 percent to 10 percent,” says Edirisinghe. “That’s a big jump.”

Another concern that Edirisinghe expressed is the amount of time that the industry will need to establish new formulations and comply with existing or new regulations.

Though the timeline before fully transitioning to natural dyes varies by company—ranging from summer 2026 to the end of 2027—Edirisinghe says he is confident that the industry has enough time to properly implement any changes.

“I think that timeline is feasible given the robust structures the industry has,” says Edirisinghe. “We are talking about billion-dollar companies. They have resources, they have money, and they can execute their plan in a short-term period.”",https://www.iit.edu/sites/default/files/2021-06/indika-orange_pomace_1280x850.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 20:02:55.610031

Consumers should stop using some of the products immediately, Costco said.

The following products were recalled:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257

This Anker Power Bank recall concerns a “potential issue involving lithium-ion battery cells,” according to Anker. Though the company says the likelihood of a malfunction is “minimal,” consumers should stop using the device immediately.

Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank — Model A1263

The Anker Powercore 10000 Power Bank recall was issued over concerns it may overheat and pose a potential fire risk. The product was sold between June 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022.

Danby 8,000 BTU U-Shaped Window Air Conditioner — Model DAC080B6IWB-6

This Danby air conditioner recall was issued after it was discovered that the units can fail to drain water quickly enough, allowing water to pool — and may potentially lead to mold growth. The air conditioner was sold between June 10, 2021, and February 2, 2022. If you have one, Danby said to stop using it immediately.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

Bridgestone said these tires “do not bear the DOT certification symbol on the tire sidewalls and therefore do not comply with tire marking requirements.” The company explains these tires were only sold as replacement equipment. The tires were manufactured June 2-22, 2024. Bridgestone explains customers can examine tires for four particular markings to determine if their tires are under recall. Tires must have all four markings, says Bridgestone. These are: 1) “Bridgestone” brand marking 2) “Blizzak 6” marking on tire line 3) “235/40R19” tire size marking and tire identification numbers of 1VR100W122224, 1VR100W122324, or 1VR100W100W122424.

Tires should not bear a “DOT” marking, says Bridgestone. The company adds that any tires reading “Blizzak LM005” are not included in the Blizzak 6 tire recall. Bridgestone says the tires can be replaced for free through Nov. 12.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

Michelin said these tires fail to meet a federal safety standard for tire endurance, and “chunks of tread rubber may detach from the shoulder block.” The Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric tires recall only includes tires in the 185/60R15C size. The affected tires can be identified by their DOT sidewall markings, which will include dimension information, ID numbers and DOT start/stop dates, which can all be found in the recall notice. Michelin says replacement tires will be offered through Jul 1, 2026.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.
The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.
The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.
The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states.","CVS Health's Omnicare has been ordered to pay $948.8 million over invalid prescriptions. The company is a leading American supplier of health products and services, with net sales broken down into medical insurance plan management services, medical benefits management, retail distribution, and other activities.

A federal judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages following a whistleblower lawsuit alleging fraudulent billing of the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions. The ruling, made by U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan, comes after a lengthy legal battle that began in 2015.

The lawsuit, filed by former Omnicare pharmacist Uri Bassan and joined by the federal government, accused Omnicare of improperly billing Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare for prescriptions at long-term care facilities. The company allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

Judge McMahon imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018, and awarded $406.8 million in damages, representing three times the $135.6 million awarded by a jury in April 2025. The tripling of damages was required under the federal False Claims Act, which allows whistleblowers to sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

The judge rejected CVS' argument that the $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment. McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying the company in 2015.

CVS Health has announced plans to appeal the judgment. The company maintains that the lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed,"" CVS said in a statement.

The ruling highlights the ongoing challenges faced by the healthcare industry in ensuring compliance with complex regulatory requirements. It also underscores the importance of robust internal controls and oversight mechanisms to prevent and detect fraudulent activities.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed.
Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company.
In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.
The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019.","A New York judge has ordered CVS Health's Omnicare subsidiary to pay $948.8 million in fees and damages as part of a False Claims Act whistleblower case.

In April, a federal jury determined that Omnicare submitted more than 3.3 million fraudulent claims for prescriptions between 2010 and 2018, which led to $135.6 million in overpayments from the government.

The jury ruled that CVS Health, which acquired Omnicare in 2015, incentivized the unit to submit more than 1 million of those claims after the merger closed. However, the jurors determined that there was no injury to the federal government related to those claims.

Given the volume of claims in the mix, the government requested $542 million in penalties against the company. In addition, Omnicare was hit with $406.8 million in damages, far higher than the $135.6 million set by the jury earlier this year.

The damages were tripled as per requirements under the False Claims Act, according to the order.

""Admittedly, that is a very big number,"" District Judge Colleen McMahon wrote in the order. ""But this is a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct.""

The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 by a former Omnicare pharmacist, and the Department of Justice joined the whistleblower case in 2019. Omnicare provides pharmacy services to long-term care facilities.

In a statement to Fierce Healthcare, a spokesperson for CVS said the company intends to appeal the penalties as ""the decision on penalties is unconstitutional, especially given the fact that there is no evidence that a single patient suffered harm.""

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing record-keeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" the spokesperson said. ""The dispensing practices referenced were limited to Omnicare, ended in 2018, were used by many others in the industry at the time, and were accepted by CMS.""

""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn’t have or that any patient was harmed,"" they said.

In the order, McMahon pushed back on CVS's argument that the penalties are unlawful.

""The violations in this case were both deliberate and egregious,"" she wrote. ""Omnicare was aware of the problems posed by its dispensing practices; it was warned again and again, both by employees and by outside (State) regulators.""

""Of great significance, Omnicare actually developed fairly straightforward means of resolving those problems but declined to implement them for years,"" she said.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-2165663502.jpg?VersionId=bRHkAfJ2udDglZzvCMsyawk_HBwEbJyM,N,,2025-07-08 18:04:45.377825

If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","The strategy: Starbucks is testing better-for-you products in a bid to win over more health-conscious consumers, per Bloomberg.

The examples:

The company is experimenting with ways to remove canola oil from its ingredient list in a nod to rising consumer skepticism of seed oils, despite a lack of conclusive evidence linking them to negative health outcomes. As part of that effort, Starbucks is testing a version of its popular egg white and roasted red pepper bites made with avocado oil.

It has removed sugar from its matcha powder and eliminated the upcharge for nondairy milk, addressing long-standing complaints from plant-based and sugar-sensitive customers.

Starbucks also tested unsweetened protein powder as a customizable add-in to its cold foam lineup, offering more nutrition-oriented options.

Why is this happening? Starbucks is repositioning its brand amid a sales slump and intensifying competition from Dutch Bros and Luckin Coffee, which are connecting with younger, value-conscious, and health-minded consumers. To stay competitive, Starbucks needs to find ways to adjust its product offerings and pricing strategies.

Our take: Starbucks is making some necessary changes—but there’s still plenty of work to do. Consumers want brands that meet them where they are, and that means prioritizing ingredient transparency and wellness without sacrificing flavor or convenience. For Starbucks, that could mean cutting back on sugar in key drinks, expanding nutritional add-ins, and offering more customizable options.

If executed well, this strategy could help Starbucks reassert its leadership in the premium coffee space.","https://www.emarketer.com/content/storage/socialsharingdefault/default-image-share.png?im=FitAndFill,width=1200,height=628",N,,2025-07-08 18:06:02.320690

Name: Chad Spooner

New Title: CFO, MiniMed

Previous Title: CFO, BIC

Medtronic has named Chad Spooner CFO of its diabetes business, beginning July 14. Medtronic plans to spin out the segment into a separate, publicly traded company called MiniMed, with the goal of completing the deal within 18 months.

Spooner has more than 25 years of experience in financial leadership, according to the Tuesday announcement. He was previously CFO of consumer goods company BIC for five years, where he played a key role in a strategy to drive innovation, growth and efficiency. He also was CFO of Slingshot Health, a startup offering a marketplace to connect patients to physicians, and held a senior finance role at GE Energy.

Que Dallara, who leads Medtronic’s diabetes business and will become CEO of MiniMed, said Spooner’s financial expertise and leadership “will be instrumental as we prepare for our next chapter as an independent company.”

Medtronic announced plans to spin out the diabetes unit in May, with the intent of giving the business the funding and focus it needs to reach its full potential in a competitive market. MiniMed would be the only diabetes tech firm to sell both continuous glucose monitors and insulin pumps. However, other companies, including Dexcom, Abbott and Insulet, have strong product portfolios, with plans for dual-analyte sensors and patch pumps.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.","Volkswagen has formed a partnership with Uber to launch autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxis across European and American markets.

The collaboration will see Volkswagen’ s ID. Buzz minivan deployed as a robotaxi solution, combining the carmaker’s manufacturing capabilities with Uber’s global ride-hailing network.

Both companies aim to address urban mobility challenges through connected, electric and sustainable transport solutions.

What is an autonomous electric ID. Buzz taxi?

The ID. Buzz is Volkswagen’s modern interpretation of its Microbus, built on the company's Modular Electric Drive (MEB) platform.

MEB is Volkswagen’s dedicated electric vehicle architecture designed to underpin multiple battery-electric models across the group’s brands.

The vehicle incorporates a 91-kWh battery pack that provides up to 234 miles of range – and the minivan supports rapid DC charging, allowing the battery to charge from 10% to 80% capacity in 26 minutes.

Volkswagen offers both rear-wheel and all-wheel drive variants, with power outputs reaching up to 335 horsepower.

“Autonomous driving is no longer a dream of the future – by 2030, it will change the everyday lives of millions of people in Europe,” says Christian Senger, Member of the Board for Fully Autonomous Mobility and Transport at Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles and CEO of ADMT GmbH.

ADMT GmbH is Volkswagen’s subsidiary focused on autonomous driving technology development.

Christian adds: “At the same time, our solution opens up a new business area for the German automotive industry: physical AI applications used for the common good.”

The Hamburg deployment forms part of Volkswagen’s broader strategy to integrate self-driving vehicles into existing public and private transport networks.

The testing programme provides data and operational experience ahead of commercial launches in other markets.

In 2026, Volkswagen plans to launch the ID. Buzz AV in Los Angeles under Uber’s platform.

Unlike fixed-route services, this deployment will offer on-demand ride-pooling options, with passengers able to request individual rides when required.

Volkswagen also intends to remove safety drivers from Los Angeles operations by the end of 2026.

European cities are expected to follow this timeline by 2027, marking the transition to fully autonomous commercial operations.

How Mobileye’s platform powers the ID. Buzz autonomous technology

The ID. Buzz AV also incorporates Mobileye’s autonomous driving platform.

Mobileye, an Intel subsidiary, develops vision-based advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving technologies for automotive manufacturers.

The vehicle’s sensor suite comprises 13 cameras, 9 LiDAR units and 5 radar systems. LiDAR technology uses laser pulses to create detailed three-dimensional maps of surrounding environments, whilst radar systems detect objects and measure their distance and speed using radio waves.

This sensor configuration generates five gigabytes of data per second, enabling real-time mapping and object detection capabilities.

Volkswagen employs proprietary mapping tools and reduces reliance on GPS systems to improve operational resilience in challenging environments.

What makes Volkswagen’s approach different from competitors who retrofit existing electric vehicles for autonomous operation – is that it manufactures the ID. Buzz AV on dedicated production lines – which the firm claims improves cost-efficiency and reduces environmental impact through streamlined manufacturing processes.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/177cad907fc4368b21dbde6a8109e56d:efa93d8474a4924e7db4d822bb10f4c1/uber-vw.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:20.685091

Porsche’s strong electric performance is all the more impressive given that the brand only has two electric models so far – the Taycan and the Macan EV.
The big growth in Porsche’s EV sales came from the new electric Macan, which is going gangbusters soon after its release.

If you’re interested in a 2025 Porsche Macan EV, you can use our link to get in contact with a local dealer.","Porsche released its sales numbers for the first half of 2025 today, and the brand is doing impressively well at EV sales.

Porsche’s 1H sales numbers are a mixed bag, with an overall worldwide sales decline of 6% year over year. But they also include a huge increase in the proportion of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug in hybrids (PHEVs), with the brand selling a total of 36.1% plug-in models across the world – meaning EVs helped to keep the company afloat as combustion car sales dropped quite a lot.

Porsche sold more BEVs than PHEVs, with a 23.5% BEV share and 12.6% PHEV share. This represents a 14.5% increase from the previous year’s results – a big rise in EV sales alongside a drop in gas model sales (hm, where have we heard that before?).

Porsche’s strong electric performance is all the more impressive given that the brand only has two electric models so far – the Taycan and the Macan EV.

Taycan sales were down 6% year over year, which isn’t too unexpected given the model’s age at this point. Porsche has come out with new variants of the Taycan, but those are high-end ultra-performance models, which don’t generally make up the meat of any particular model’s sales numbers.

The big growth in Porsche’s EV sales came from the new electric Macan, which is going gangbusters soon after its release.

Macan is Porsche’s best-selling model, and sales were up 15% for the model overall. That number was buoyed by massive interest in the EV version, which accounted for “almost 60%” (actually 57%) of Porsche’s Macan sales – meaning the EV model sold ~134% as many units as the gas model. Totals were 25,884 for the EV, and 19,253 for combustion models.

Part of the reason for this is because Europe no longer sells the ICE Macan, but outside of Europe, it’s still available, and the EV is still popular (as far as we know, the EV isn’t quite a majority of Macan sales in the US, but it’s close to the gas model, and that’s still much higher than the national ~10% EV share, which the US is an international laggard at)

“The fully electric Macan is making a significant contribution to our proportion of electrified cars. Overall, we have succeeded in keeping sales volumes stable and balanced across the sales regions despite ongoing geopolitical challenges. Our customers continue to place great value on individualised vehicles and we will continue to expand our offerings in this area.”

-Matthias Becker, Board Member for Sales and Marketing, Porsche

We can expect, or at least hope for, similar strong EV sales performance from upcoming Porsche electric models. The next one to release will be the Cayenne EV, which we’ve seen recently setting a hillclimb record and towing lots of stuff in disguise. We expect a full release of that model within the next year.

Porsche also has both the Boxster and Cayman EVs in the pipeline for the future. The only model we’ve not yet heard real plans to electrify is the 911 (c’mon Porsche, why would you wait so long to upgrade your best model? isn’t it embarrassing to see a Macan beating a 911 off the line?)

Across regions, sales were down in Germany (primarily due to strong year-ago performance, says Porsche), China, and the rest of Europe, and up in North America and “rest of the world.” China is of particular note, where Porsche sales dropped 28%, the largest global decrease.

Western automakers have been having a really tough time in China, due to the strength of domestic competition and rapid rise in EV sales percentage there, which caught them by surprise. You can expect more of that to come as Chinese automakers will only get better, particularly as Western governments and automakers (yes, including you, Porsche) unwisely pull back on EV goals, leaving room for China to step up and become more prominent globally.

Electrek’s Take

I reviewed the Macan EV earlier this year and came away thinking that Porsche is great at making cars, but that it could still use some tweaking of its EV strategy. The car didn’t really feel like Porsche was “all-in” on EVs, and wasn’t utilizing the unique advantages of EVs to make a car that was fully focused on being electric, even though the bones of the model show the typical excellent driving dynamics that you would expect out of a Porsche.

So these numbers either show that I’m wrong about EV strategy, or show just how superior electric powertrains can be. Because even though I think there were some missteps in the design of Porsche’s electric model, it’s still just so much better than the gas model.

And, thankfully, the public and Porsche’s dealers seem to get it too. A lot of brands have a tough time selling EVs, often because their dealers refuse to. Porsche’s dealers seem to get it a lot more than a lot of companies, which is a credit to them and to Porsche as a whole for educating them properly about the strengths of their electric models.

So we’re looking forward to seeing how sales go with those future EV models… particularly the eventual and inevitable 911 (I recently drove an EV restomod 911, and it was maybe the best driving experience I’ve ever had in a car, so c’mon Porsche, if Everrati can do it then I know you can).

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy.
As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain.
RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG?
This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""","CVS Caremark, one of the three major pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) in the U.S., stopped coverage for Eli Lilly's popular weight-loss drug Zepbound, blaming drugs like it for driving up overall plan costs.

GLP-1 products, originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, but are now FDA-approved specifically for obesity under brand names like Wegovy and Zepbound, are ""significantly contributing to overall plan costs"", CVS spokesperson Phillip Blando told FOX Business. Removing coverage of the drug will result in an estimated client savings of 10% to 15% year over year in the anti-obesity medication space for its clients who choose to cover these medications for weight loss, according to Blando.

Zepbound, the brand name for Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, was approved by the FDA in 2023 for chronic weight management in adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related medical problems. Tirzepatide was already approved to treat type 2 diabetes and was sold under the brand name Mounjaro.

TRUMP SAYS DRUG PRICES WILL BE CUT BY AS MUCH AS 90%: WHAT TO KNOW

Zepbound was widely viewed as a game-changer in the fight against obesity, after participants in a late-stage study lost up to a quarter of their body weight – making it more effective than Wegovy.

Blando said the ""egregiously high list prices"" for GLP-1 products that are set by drug manufacturers are ""the single biggest barrier to patient access.""

""Many payers, including Medicare and numerous state benefit plans, have declined to cover GLP-1s for weight loss because of the unsustainably high prices set by brand pharma,"" he said.

However, there will still be exceptions if the drug is deemed a ""medical necessity."" That exemption will be reviewed ""on a case-by-case basis,"" according to Blando.

CVS Caremark is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corp., which also owns CVS Pharmacy. As a pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark essentially acts as a negotiator between pharmacies, insurers and drug manufacturers within the prescription drug supply chain. PBMs negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies to decide how much medicines cost, which drugs people can get and which pharmacies are part of their network.

Pharmaceutical giants have been critical of PBMs, saying their role needs to change. Eli Lilly previously told FOX Business that the only way to lower prices for U.S. consumers is if ""intermediaries take less for themselves.""

Gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist Dr. Christopher McGowan told FOX Business that CVS Caremark’s decision to drop coverage of the drug is ""deeply disruptive for patients who are already stable and thriving on the medication.""

RUNNING LOW ON OZEMPIC OR ANOTHER WEIGHT LOSS DRUG? A NEW TRACKER CAN HELP

""We’re now seeing insurance policy override medical judgment – forcing patients to switch to an alternative that, while still effective, has been shown in head-to-head trials to produce less weight loss than Zepbound,"" McGowan said.

McGowan highlighted that GLP-1 medications ""are not interchangeable in practice, even if they appear similar on paper."" He said switching medications ""mid-journey can reverse hard-won progress.""

""For many, this isn’t just a simple substitution. It’s a high-stakes change that can affect long-term outcomes, trigger weight regain, or introduce new side effects,"" McGowan said.

This goes beyond CVS Caremark, according to McGowan, who is concerned that its decision with Zepbound ""underscores a troubling trend"" in which ""financial contracts between benefit managers and drug manufacturers are increasingly shaping clinical decisions.""

This means patients with fewer choices not because of what’s best for their health, but because of behind-the-scenes rebate deals, he continued.

""In obesity care, continuity matters. Once a patient finds a medication that works, preserving that success should be the priority,"" he said. ""Instead, we’re seeing progress disrupted and patients forced to navigate treatment changes they never asked for.""

Eli Lilly told FOX Business that the company is committed to ensuring patients have access to the treatment they need.

""While not all CVS Caremark plans are impacted, we’ve made robust efforts to proactively communicate with many of the patients who may be affected and provided clear next steps through our support programs,"" Lilly said in a statement, adding that the company is encouraging patients to speak with their healthcare providers about medical necessity exceptions or alternative coverage pathways. It has also added resources on its website.

If customers do lose coverage, Eli Lilly said it expanded access through LillyDirect’s Self Pay Pharmacy Solutions, which is the company's self-pay program, which removes some third-party supply chain entities, offering patients without coverage drugs at a discount.

The pharmaceutical giant said a patient that's prescribed Zepbound and needs access to it without going through their health insurance can get single-dose vials for around $500.",https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/07/0/0/cvs-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:44.991716

Not John Deere.
John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.” Which is what you would expect.
It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case.","The writing is on the wall.

Should John Deere choose to defend itself in court rather than attempt to reach a settlement, it very much may be handed a massive spanking by the Justice Department, which alleges the company’s repair restrictions violate federal and state antitrust laws. See here, here and here.

In a nutshell, the Justice Department claims Deere is scamming farmers by forcing them to exclusively use Deere dealers to repair their combines and tractors when they stop running. The feds have a case.

As it turns out, it takes proprietary diagnostic software to fix broken Deere tractors. Software that Deere refuses to sell to DIY farmers or independent repair shops. Deere likes it that way because it provides the company a significant after-market revenue stream.

The four-count Federal Trade Commission lawsuit isn’t playing around, alleging Deere monopolized the restricted repair services market, violated the FTC Act by using an unfair method of competition, and violated both Minnesota and Illinois antitrust laws.

John Deere lawyers threw spaghetti at the court walls, hoping something would stick and keep it from having to defend its software at trial.

Among the arguments Deere makes are that the feds’ claims of unfair competition and monopolization are factually and legally insufficient. And for good measure — just in case the unfair competition argument went south — Deere challenged the FTC’s constitutional structure, whether states that joined in the Justice Department’s case have standing, as well as the timeliness of the states’ claims.

The ruling by Judge Iain D. Johnson, of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois-Western Division, rejected all of Deere’s legal posturing.

Johnson writes that at this stage of the case — a motion for judgment on the pleadings — he has to accept the Justice Department allegations as factual:

“The Governments say there’s a throughline between Deere’s practices: farmers have no alternatives because of the system created by Deere, which charges supracompetitive prices because of the lack of any alternatives. In technologizing its equipment, Deere makes farmers reliant on Deere’s own ADVISOR software. And, in only licensing that software to its authorized Dealers, Deere forces farmers to visit those shops instead of using closer, cheaper options.”

Johnson also noted Deere reaps massive profits from its parts business, which relies on those authorized dealers’ repairs. And Johnson says “because only Deere can create and license the ADVISOR [repair] tool, it entirely controls who (and how many) Dealers may perform restricted repairs and, by extension, how much the Dealers can charge.”

Which suggests Deere might have a significant uphill climb to refute the Justice Department.

This isn’t Johnson’s first rodeo in handling Deere’s software litigation. In late 2023, he rejected Deere’s attempt to dismiss consolidated lawsuits filed by farmers alleging that Deere conspired to restrict services for repair.

In its most recent failed motion for judgment on the pleadings, Deere recycled some of the same arguments it made in 2023, to which Johnson responded:

“Sequels so rarely beat their originals that even the acclaimed Steve Martin couldn’t do it on three tries. See Cheaper by the Dozen II, Pink Panther II, Father of the Bride II. Rebooting its earlier production, Deere sought to defy the odds. To be sure, like nearly all sequels, Deere edited the dialogue and cast some new characters, giving cameos to veteran stars like Humphrey’s Executor. But ultimately the plot felt predictable, the script derivative. Deere I received a thumbs-down, and Deere II fares no better.”

In the immediate aftermath of Johnson’s ruling no one was talking publicly. Not John Deere. Not the Justice Department. Perhaps behind the scenes, the feds and Deere are talking to each other.

The Justice Department is seeking a permanent injunction against Deere, as well as an order to make the company’s full-function service ADVISOR software available to all owners of Deere large tractors and combines.

Back in January when the outgoing Biden administration filed suit against Deere, the company said publicly:

“The complaint is based on flagrant misrepresentations of the facts and fatally flawed legal theories and it punishes innovation and procompetitive-product design. John Deere will vigorously defend itself against this baseless lawsuit.”

Which is what you would expect. But I wonder if Deere higher-ups privately feel the same way. Are they willing to legally go to the mattresses, all the way to the Supreme Court? I feel as though this isn’t the type of case the Justice Department will drop if it loses at the district court.

That the Trump Justice Department hasn’t flat out dropped the case is telling. The feds appear squarely in the farmers’ camp. It’s likely John Deere lobbyists are working overtime to get lawmakers to put pressure on the Justice Department to drop the case. How might that play out?

Are Deere and the Justice Department exploring a settlement?

I imagine there are many moving pieces — many of which have nothing to do directly with the proceedings in Johnson’s court.

Right-to-repair advocates were applauding Johnson’s ruling that the antitrust law case can go forward, but whether farmers who own Deere rigs ultimately get access to the software they need to independently fix them is still far from settled.

By targeting corporations such as Albertsons, The Southern Company, and Merck, these groups are reshaping shareholder activism, forcing companies to confront the tension between social responsibility and profit-driven governance. For investors, the question is stark: Do anti-ESG campaigns represent a legitimate safeguard against corporate overreach, or a destabilizing force undermining long-term value creation?

The Bowyer Playbook: Targeting ESG's Soft Underbelly

Bowyer Research's strategy hinges on exploiting low shareholder ownership thresholds (as little as 1%) to convene special meetings and push proxy proposals. These proposals rarely win majority votes—most secure under 5% support—but their symbolic impact is profound. By framing ESG initiatives as “politicized” or financially risky, Bowyer seeks to delegitimize corporate commitments to diversity, environmental goals, and social justice.

Albertsons: Bowyer's 2024 proposal urged the supermarket giant to audit the costs of its partnerships with LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and its “diversity training” programs. The argument? Such initiatives risk alienating customers and employees with conservative values while offering no clear financial upside.

The Southern Company: A 2023 proposal demanded a cost-benefit analysis of its decarbonization plans, arguing that investments in renewables threaten shareholder returns in a fossil fuel-dependent economy.

Merck: In 2024, Bowyer called for an evaluation of how the pharmaceutical giant's DEI policies might expose it to legal risks under the Harvard affirmative action ruling, which tightened scrutiny of race-conscious practices.

The Risks of Activist Overreach

While Bowyer's proposals fail at the ballot box, their persistence creates tangible risks. First, legal and reputational costs: Companies must divert resources to respond to repeated challenges, even if they reject the proposals. Second, governance instability: Frequent special meetings may signal to investors that management is distracted from core priorities. Third, ESG devaluation: If anti-ESG groups succeed in framing ESG as a “niche” concern, companies may retreat from initiatives that could build long-term resilience (e.g., climate adaptation, inclusive workforces).

Consider Merck's case: Even if its DEI program survives, the threat of litigation could deter it from bold recruitment or supplier diversity goals. For The Southern Company, scaling back renewables might appease activists but leave it unprepared for a carbon-constrained future.

The Legal Battlefield: SEC Rules and Shareholder Democracy

Bowyer's success depends on exempt solicitations remaining a low-cost tool. However, the SEC's recent NCPPR v. SEC ruling—upholding its authority to exclude “ordinary business” proposals—could curb such campaigns. If upheld, this precedent might limit activists' ability to challenge ESG initiatives as non-pecuniary. Yet, anti-ESG groups are refining strategies, such as framing proposals as financial risk assessments (e.g., “evaluating the cost of DEI lawsuits”) to evade exclusion.

Investment Implications: Navigating the ESG-Fiduciary Tightrope

For investors, the key is to distinguish between strategic ESG integration (e.g., climate risk mitigation) and activist-driven theatrics (e.g., symbolic DEI pledges). Companies that align ESG with profitability—such as The Southern Company's balance of renewables and fossil fuels—may weather activism better than those seen as chasing “woke” reputational gains.

Actionable Insights:

1. Avoid Companies with Weak ESG-Performance Linkages: Firms using ESG as a marketing tool, not a risk management strategy, face higher reputational and financial risks from anti-ESG campaigns.

2. Monitor SEC Regulatory Shifts: A pro-ESG SEC could penalize exempt solicitations, while a deregulatory tilt might empower activists.

3. Favor Firms with Transparent ESG Cost-Benefit Analysis: Companies like Merck that publicly justify DEI investments (e.g., “diverse teams drive innovation”) are less vulnerable to Bowyer's “reckless spending” critiques.

Conclusion: The New Fiduciary Imperative

Bowyer Research's campaigns highlight a deeper truth: ESG is no longer optional but a core governance issue. Investors must demand that companies articulate how their ESG priorities align with shareholder value—whether through risk mitigation, talent retention, or market access. Those that cannot will face relentless pressure from activists and regulators alike. In this era of exempt solicitations and ideological warfare, the winners will be firms that treat ESG as a strategic asset, not a political football.",,N,,2025-07-08 19:07:30.296340

Medtronic workers will need to be in office four days a week starting Sept. 2, up from three days a week.","3M is telling its corporate workforce to return to the office four days a week starting Sept. 1, CEO Bill Brown wrote in a letter to employees today.

Why it matters: 3M was one of the last holdouts of major Twin Cities corporations calling their workers back and the move by the Maplewood-based company underscores a major shift happening this summer.

What they're saying: ""I believe our ability to engage, collaborate and innovate is stronger in person,"" Brown wrote to employees.

He referenced the company's progress with its ""Collaboration Days"" policy that started in 2024 and brought managers back three days a week.

Brown wrote in his email that some employees will return right away in September, while others will need to wait for office renovations, which could take until late 2026. The policy does not apply to existing remote employees who are working distantly.

State of play: Some surveys have shown that many employees say they will find a new job if they can't work from home, but the options for remote work are dwindling among Minnesota's largest employers.

Employees at Minnesota' largest corporation, UnitedHealth Group, were called back four days a week starting on Monday. Medtronic workers will need to be in office four days a week starting Sept. 2, up from three days a week.

This summer, Target began requiring multiple divisions to come back to its Minneapolis headquarters.

The state of Minnesota's June 1 mandate requires 50% in-office work.

Golden Valley-based General Mills called the bulk of its employees back Tuesday through Thursday in February.

By the numbers: More in-person work is starting to show up in office space leasing metrics.

Quarterly absorption in the Twin Cities — which measures how much space is leased against how much is vacated or constructed — was positive for the first time since 2020, according to a new report by commercial real estate firm JLL.

JLL says a hefty amount of demand for space will keep leasing strong for the foreseeable future.

The bottom line: While the days of employees working mostly from home are over for big corporations, policies mandating three or four days in the office per week are still more flexible than pre-pandemic setups.",https://images.axios.com/vI1xiNjSCfNNdt__FaIvnm0ovD0=/0x343:5100x3212/1366x768/2025/07/08/1751999182990.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:47.450660

The warehouse retailer flagged 10 items in recent months for recalls, produced by a variety of manufacturers but sold by Costco. Some were also sold through Costco Next, a program that lets customers buy directly from brands at Costco prices.

The products range from window air conditions to power banks to car tires.

Here's what's included in the recall list:

Anker Power Bank (10K, 22.5W) — Model A1257 (Costco Next)

These power banks were included in a worldwide recall by Anker over reports that some of the items had caught fire or exploded.

Danby 8k U-Shape Window Air Conditioner (Item #1498424)

These air conditioners, sold on the Costco website between June 10, 2021, and Feb. 2, 2022, are being recalled because they could grow mold. The manufacturer says pooled water can't drain quickly enough from them, risking the growth of harmful molds.

Michelin Agilis CrossClimate C-Metric Tires Size 185/60R15C

These Michelin-brand tires are under a recall notice because they don't meet federal guidelines for tire endurance. Federal regulators warn that the tires could increase the risk of a crash. Information to identify your tires is located on the sidewall of each tire, directly above the bead.

Bridgestone Blizzak 6 Tires

These tires, sold only as replacements, don't meet federal safety regulations. Although they adhere to performance requirements, they lack certain markings identifying their use, increasing the risk of the tires being used in improper ways, and increasing the risk of a crash. They were manufactured between June 2 and June 22, 2024, and sold through Costco's automotive department.

Anker Powercore 1000 Power Bank (Costco Next)

These power banks were also part of Anker's nationwide recall over the risk of fire or explosion from the lithium-ion battery within them.

BowFlex Adjustable Dumbbells

These dumbbells are under a voluntary recall because the plates that add weight to them may get dislodged from the handle while being used, causing a safety hazard.

Midea U-Shape Window AC's (Item #'s 1572673, 1657921, 1677429, 1768985, 2677450, and 2677429)

These window-mounted AC units are also being recalled for mold, with the manufacturer warning that pooling water may fail to drain. Mold can cause respiratory issues or lead to infection, especially in the young or elderly.

Topo Chico Mineral Water Glass 18pk - Select Lot Code - Select Locations in Texas and Louisiana (Item #1439351)

Between May 20 and May 29, 2025, Costco sold Topo Chico Mineral Water at a number of locations in Texas and Louisiana. The recall was issued because the water may be contaminated with pseudomonas, a bacteria that is naturally found in some mineral waters. While the bacteria poses little health risk for healthy individuals, it could cause problems for those with compromised immune systems.

Igloo 90 Qt Flip & Tow Rolling Cooler (Item #1356922)

Costco is also warning customers about Igloo ice coolers as part of a nationwide recall, after numerous reports of the tow handles on the coolers pinching fingers while being used, sometimes causing amputation.

Ninja Foodi Pressure Cooker + Air Fryer (Item #2297950 and #3297950)

A number of Ninja-brand pressure cookers have been recalled after being sold at retailers across the U.S., including Costco, because they may cause severe burns. The recall was issued after reports that the lid on the device could be opened while the contents of the cooker were pressurized, causing severe burns and injuries from the hot contents. The pressure cookers were sold between May 2019 and May 2021.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/CCT/images/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022/20250603T195933/bcc3d0ab-0c55-4aef-9ba9-f36f7bb1b022_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 16:08:51.054045

Starbucks has rolled out a new layered line of Frappuccino drinks for which the iced, blended beverages are topped with the coffeehouse chain’s signature cold foam.

The new Strato line of beverages, named for the Italian word for “layer,” is now available nationwide.

Although baristas could always add cold foam, made with flavored, aerated skim milk, to beverages upon request (at least since the cold foam was introduced in 2018), they can now be ordered that way via the chain’s app.

They’re available in three flavors, each priced at around $5.95 for a medium “Grande”:

Brown Sugar Strato Frappuccino: Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with brown sugar cold foam and a dusting of cinnamon powder

Strawberry Matcha Strato Frappuccino: Simple syrup and matcha powder blended with ice and whole milk topped with strawberry cold foam

Salted Caramel Mocha Strato Frappuccino: Mocha sauce and Frappuccino roast coffee syrup blended with ice and whole milk topped with salted caramel cold foam and a caramel syrup drizzle

These particular iterations of the Strato platform will be available while supplies last this summer, with new iterations likely to be introduced later in the year.

The first Strato Frappuccino was actually introduced last week, although it wasn’t called by that name, and was only available for that week.

The Firework Frappuccino used the chain’s Summer Berry Refresher as its base, blended with coconut milk, poured over raspberry-flavored popping pearls, swirled with strawberry purée and topped with vanilla cold foam. A Starbucks barista commenting on a TikTok post about the week-long special said that, while people seemed to enjoy it, “I hate making these,” because they require 13 steps.

Layered drinks such as the Strato offer texture and temperature contrasts that appear to appeal to younger consumers. Their color variations also play well on social media.

Earlier this year, Starbucks removed nine Frappuccino drinks from its regular menu as part of a planned 30% menu reduction, but it teased the Strato line during a June convention of Starbucks managers in Las Vegas, among other new food and beverage offerings, including a dark 1971 Roast, named for the year the chain was founded, that is slated to debut this winter, as well as the return of raspberry sauce, updated croissants, and a new cold foam with 15 grams of protein.

“Rite Aid Corporation today announced that it has successfully entered into a series of sale agreements and pharmacy services transition agreements. This includes the rolling transition of pharmacy assets from more than 1,000 store locations across the U.S. to operators including CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, Albertsons, Kroger, and Giant Eagle, among others, as well as the sale and operation by CVS Pharmacy of many Rite Aid and Bartell Drugs stores located in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho,” a May 15 news release from Rite Aid states.

Rite Aid has now filed 10 notices of extensive lists of closing stores across the country.

CVS is set to take over Bellingham’s 220 36th St. location, along with Rite Aid locations in Ferndale, Lynden and Blaine, according to Cascadia Daily News.

No opening dates for the new CVS Pharmacies have been announced.

CVS DOWNFALL

CVS has confirmed that it will be shutting down 271 locations in 2025.

The struggling pharmacy chain has shut 900 spots over the past three years.

Between 2022 and 2024, CVS wiped out the 900 locations from its nationwide footprint.

The full list of the 271 CVS locations has not yet been released, but local news sources and Newsweek have locked in on about 39 spread across 17 states and Washington DC so far.

A spokesperson for the company said: ""We're focused on ensuring we have the right kinds of stores and the right number of stores in the right locations.

""We're closing locations strategically to better meet consumers'

""At the same time, big rivals like Walgreens health, wellness, and pharmacy care needs — as announced more than three years ago —not in reaction to industry pressures.""

During this, CVS has also pledged to lower prices on prescriptions, amid its many closures.

CEO David Joyner said: ""These entities remain the only part of the drug supply chain entirely focused on lowering costs.

""For more than three decades, PBMs have been a proven unequivocal mechanism to negotiate down the price of drugs for payers and consumers while promoting better adherence and better health.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/07/newspress-collage-52bm6nxtm-1751997828356.jpg?1751983447&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:36.844608

Capgemini CEO Aiman Ezzat has taken a measured approach to AI implementation, keeping client experience, cost, and use case at the core of every project. In an interaction with TOI before the WNS deal was announced, he said India remains a strategic hub for Capgemini, which currently has 175,000 employees in the country and is planning a gross addition of 45,000 this year. Ezzat said that GenAI and Agentic AI represented more than 6% of its bookings in the March quarter. The group has forecast revenue growth of -2% to 2% in constant currency for the 2025 financial year.

To what extent has GenAI influenced your internal software development?

It had some impact—especially when it comes to generating new code, where it performs reasonably well. However, even in those cases, the output still requires review, debugging, and thorough testing. So, while there are productivity gains, they’re not as significant as many people assume. When working with existing codebases or complex environments, the benefits are more limited. We’ve used GenAI for enhancements, for example, but the productivity improvements weren’t as dramatic as some might expect. There’s also a common misconception: increased productivity doesn’t automatically translate to cost savings. For instance, a 30% productivity gain among lower-cost roles like testers doesn’t have the same financial impact as a similar gain in higher-cost roles such as project managers or functional analysts. That nuance often gets overlooked. Beyond productivity, we’re equally focused on quality—delivering faster, but with better, more reliable code. So it's not just about cutting costs; multiple factors are driving our approach.

There are discussions around cost overruns with AI implementations. While productivity gains are evident, the operational costs of running AI remain a challenge.

We halted one client’s chatbot project—it was going to cost $25 million per year due to data consumption. The financial return just wasn’t there. AI solutions need to be evaluated case-by-case. Not all implementations yield a positive ROI. That said, in many situations, we can find reasonable returns, whether from speed, quality, or other value drivers.

From a broader perspective—on a recent investor call, you mentioned a subdued demand environment. Has anything shifted since then?

Demand remained steady over the past few months. Some industries are seeing growth, while others continue to face pressure. Overall, it’s a flat environment. We’re not seeing a sharp uptick in activity, but there also haven’t been significant cutbacks due to tariffs or other factors. What remains consistent is the focus on efficiency—cost reduction, productivity gains, and operational optimisation—rather than growth. Given the uncertain economic outlook and muted growth, companies are prioritising savings over innovation. Most large-scale transformations today are centred around cost optimisation, supply chain improvements, and boosting productivity. When it comes to efficiency and cost focus, there's no major difference. But in AI adoption—the US typically moves faster and is more aggressive. American companies are often quick to embrace new tech to stay ahead, while European firms tend to be more measured and cautious. That said, it still varies by company, so it's hard to generalise too much.

There’s growing momentum around GCCs in India. What's Capgemini's playbook?

It’s a natural shift. Clients want more control over key talent areas like tech and shared services, and GCCs offer that. India is a major talent hub, and many clients rely on us to set up, scale, and manage their local operations. We see it as a partnership—GCCs don’t replace us; we continue to support clients even after the setup. That’s the good news—there’s broad recognition that part of global operations, including proprietary work, will be based in India. It shows how Indian talent is important for in-house roles, and that’s a positive shift for both India and firms looking at global partnerships.

In one example, the company is considering making its egg white and roasted red pepper bites without canola oil, a spokesperson said in response to an inquiry from Bloomberg News. The company will also add a new egg bite to its menu that is made with avocado oil.

The coffee chain is in the midst of a brand revamp as it seeks to reverse a sales slump, and one of its priorities is testing products that appeal to more health-conscious consumers. In June, Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol pledged in a meeting with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to further align the chain’s menu with the Trump administration’s health priorities, Kennedy said in a post on X.

Starbucks’ U.S. menu has a number of items that contain canola oil, including a bacon, Gouda and egg sandwich, as well as potato bakes. Starbucks didn’t provide a timeline for the changes to its food lineup.

Seed oils, such as soybean and canola, have become a target for Kennedy and his allies, though multiple meta-analyses have indicated they have no significant impact on inflammation or the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.

The health push is showing up in other places on Starbucks’ menu. The chain removed sugar from its matcha powder in a move that boosted sales, Niccol said during an April earnings call. It also nixed an upcharge for nondairy milk and a recent pilot involves unsweetened protein powder, which can be added to any cold foam flavor.

The chain’s latest U.S. beverage launch was a limited-time Fourth of July themed Frappuccino. The 16-ounce version contains 59 grams of sugar, according to the chain’s website. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume less than 36 grams of added sugar a day and women less than 25 grams.

There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.
Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.
WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.","LONDON: Two big industry names tipped as potential candidates to be the next chief executive of WPP are not in the running for the job.

Campaign understands that Matt Brittin, former EMEA president of Google, and David Droga, outgoing chief executive of Accenture Song, are not involved in the agency holding company's recruitment process. (Campaign is PRWeek's sister business media outlet at Haymarket Media).

WPP has given no update on its search since June 9, when the British agency group said Mark Read, chief executive since 2018, is planning to step down but will remain in the job until December 31, when he will retire from the board.

However, multiple sources said they believe WPP’s board, which is led by Philip Jansen, chair, is set make a decision soon. An appointment will come “sooner than expected,"" one person said.

When WPP last looked for a CEO in 2018, after Martin Sorrell abruptly exited, the search took four and a half months, but Read was widely seen as the internal favorite from the start of the process – unlike in 2025 when no frontrunner has yet emerged.

There have been rumours in industry circles since March that WPP has made overtures to Brittin, but it is understood he is not looking for an executive board role in the near term, after leaving Google this summer.

Brittin previously said in a LinkedIn post when he first announced his departure that he wanted to “take a break for the first time since leaving school – a ‘mini gap year’” – and he was looking forward to spending more time with his family “in the year ahead.""

Droga’s decision to step down as chief executive of Accenture Song in May and move to a new role as vice chair of parent company Accenture also fueled speculation that WPP has approached the Droga5 founder. However, it is understood Droga is not interested in the WPP CEO role.

Other external industry names who have been linked with the vacancy include Lord Carter, chief executive of Informa, the owner of Cannes Lions, who worked at WPP early in his career. Informa did not comment. A source said analysts would be surprised if Carter were to make a move given his expansion plans for Informa.

There has been no word on whether internal candidates may have pitched for the WPP job.

WPP declined to comment on the process.

Jansen, former chief executive of BT, started as WPP chair on January 1, having first been named to the job in July 2024.

Speaking at his first WPP annual shareholder meeting in May, Jansen told investors that the board was under no obligation to make immediate changes, but the nominations committee “continually takes a long-term view on board succession planning."" Read’s departure was announced a little over two weeks later.

WPP has been under pressure as it faces a third year of lackluster revenue growth, with a decline of between zero and 2% expected in 2025. It has lost some major media accounts, including Coca-Cola in North America and Mars globally, to Publicis Groupe.

WPP’s share price has fallen 37% since the start of 2025, reducing its stock market valuation from £8.9 billion to £5.6 billion.

Analysts at Barclays warned in a note last month that they expect WPP’s “underperformance to continue” in the short term, partly “because of the uncertainties created by a change in management.""

“On average, media stocks that have seen a change in management underperform by 10% between the announcement of a change in CEO and the strategy of the new CEO being unveiled,” Barclays said.

The investment bank added that “we do not believe, unlike others, that WPP is fundamentally impaired and we do believe that the new CEO can turn this ship around, but it is likely to come with higher investments and lower margins initially.""

WPP's flagship agency divisions include WPP Media, led by Brian Lesser and previously known as Group M; VML, led by Jon Cook; and Ogilvy, led by Devika Bulchandani, and a number of smaller subsidiaries, including specialist communications, led by Johnny Hornby.

As reciprocal restrictions disrupt traditional trade routes, investors are poised to capitalize on strategic arbitrage opportunities through cross-border mergers & acquisitions (M&A) and regional production diversification. This article outlines how companies are reconfiguring their supply chains—and which stocks to buy, avoid, or short—to profit from—or mitigate—the fallout.

The Trade War in Context: Reciprocal Barriers and Market Fragmentation

Since June 2025, the EU has banned Chinese medical device firms from bidding on public contracts exceeding €5 million, while capping Chinese component usage at 50%. In retaliation, China excluded EU-based companies from tenders above 45 million yuan ($6.3 million). These measures, rooted in accusations of unfair trade practices (e.g., China's “Made in China 2025” localization mandates), have split the $500 billion global medtech market into two walled gardens.

The stakes are high: China's medtech exports to the EU totaled €11.4 billion in 2024, while EU firms face exclusion from 87% of China's public tenders. Companies unable to adapt risk losing access to critical markets, while agile players can dominate niche segments.

Strategic Responses: M&A and Regional Diversification

1. European Firms Acquiring Chinese Partners

To bypass China's procurement bans, EU medtech companies are partnering with or acquiring local Chinese firms to qualify for domestic tenders. Philips (NYSE: PHG) exemplifies this strategy: 90% of its Chinese sales are generated through local manufacturing, shielding it from exclusion. Similarly, Siemens Healthineers (OTCPK: SHLGY) leverages its 15%-revenue-generating China business to navigate restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Back firms with localized production in China, such as Philips or Becton Dickinson (NYSE: BDX), which already sources 70% of its Chinese devices domestically. These companies benefit from dual access: EU procurement (via non-Chinese components) and China's fast-growing market.

2. Shifting Production to ASEAN

The EU's restrictions have spurred a rush to ASEAN, where countries like Thailand and Malaysia offer cost-effective, geopolitically neutral manufacturing hubs. Stryker (NYSE: SYK) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) are expanding production in Vietnam and Indonesia to avoid reliance on China. This strategy not only circumvents trade barriers but also taps into ASEAN's $35 billion medtech market.

Investment Opportunity: Invest in firms with flexible supply chains and ASEAN exposure, such as Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE: TMO) or Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), whose robotic surgery systems are in high demand across fragmented markets.

3. Chinese Firms Seeking EU Assets

While the research highlights limited Chinese acquisitions of EU assets to date, the potential remains. Chinese firms like Mindray Medical (SZSE: 300760) or United Imaging could target EU-based R&D firms or niche manufacturers to gain access to EU procurement tenders. Such deals would allow them to rebrand as “European” entities and bypass the IPI's restrictions.

Investment Opportunity: Monitor state-backed Chinese firms with strong balance sheets, such as Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), for opportunistic EU acquisitions.

Risks and Short Candidates

The trade war's escalation carries significant risks:

- Geopolitical Volatility: Escalating tariffs or WTO disputes could disrupt supply chains further.

- Overcapacity in ASEAN: Rapid manufacturing shifts may lead to oversupply and margin compression.

Avoid or Short:

- Pure-play exporters to China/EU, such as Smiths Group (LSE: SMIN) or Getinge (OMX: GETI), which lack localized production.

- Companies reliant on high-Chinese-component exports, such as Teleflex (NYSE: TLS), whose EU sales could collapse under the 50% threshold rule.

Conclusion: Bet on Flexibility and Diversification

The EU-China medtech trade war is a zero-sum game for traditional players but a goldmine for firms willing to reconfigure their supply chains. Investors should prioritize companies with localized manufacturing in China, ASEAN production hubs, or cross-border joint ventures. Meanwhile, shorting firms stuck in the trade crossfire offers asymmetric risk-reward. As the world's two largest medtech markets fracture, the winners will be those who master the art of arbitrage in this new reality.

Final Note: Monitor the EU-China summit in late July 2025 for de-escalation signals. If talks fail, expect accelerated M&A activity and deeper supply chain reconfiguration—a scenario favoring the strategies outlined above.",,N,,2025-07-08 18:05:32.627092

Publication Date: July 8, 2025

Intel and HP have co-engineered a new class of AI PCs that run AI workloads locally for enhanced speed and privacy. The collaboration delivers up to 223% faster performance on key business apps, enabling measurable productivity gains.

What is Covered in this Article:

Intel and HP co-engineered AI PCs for business users, including the EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra, and EliteBook 8, powered by Intel Core Ultra 200V series processors.

Intel optimized CPU, GPU, and NPU resources across 12 configurations and 8 AI PC models, validating performance on key enterprise applications.

AI apps like Power BI, Tableau, and Canvid showed performance gains of up to 223% versus prior-gen systems, with first-time Windows availability for Canvid and Writeup.

Intel’s hands-on involvement extended to benchmarking 9 AI-enhanced applications for HP’s go-to-market execution.

Despite macro uncertainty in PC demand, the collaboration showcases tangible improvements in business productivity from local AI capabilities.

The News: HP and Intel have teamed up to launch a new lineup of AI-powered PCs built for business use, including the EliteBook X, EliteBook Ultra, and EliteBook 8. These devices are designed with a focus on productivity and privacy and run on Intel’s Core Ultra 200V processors. Both companies worked together on the hardware and software to ensure these machines could handle AI tasks locally, using the CPU, GPU, and NPU.

Over eight months, Intel and HP tested a dozen hardware setups across eight different AI PC models. This effort helped fine-tune nine AI-focused apps – like Power BI, Tableau, Adobe Lightroom, Canvid, and Writeup—with noticeable performance boosts over older systems.

Can Intel and HP Finally Make AI PCs a Must-Have for Business?

Analyst Take: The HP-Intel partnership on these AI PCs is a strong, data-backed push to shift business computing toward on-device AI. With 62% of enterprise IT leaders adopting AI PCs to futureproof their organizations, this launch gives the segment much-needed credibility backed by purpose-driven investment. The detailed performance data and use-case testing give HP a strong story to tell enterprise buyers while also helping Intel stay competitive against AMD and Qualcomm, who are rolling out their AI-focused chips.

Performance Improvements Backed by Data

Unlike some AI PC rollouts that have featured vague performance promises, HP and Intel are backing these with solid numbers. Compared to previous systems, Power BI saw up to 45% speed improvements, Tableau was 48% faster, and Adobe Lightroom ran 32% quicker. Canvid, the screen recording tool, was also up to 223% faster. Similarly, the local AI writing tool Writeup hit 165% better output speeds. These results came from over 500 hours of benchmarking by Intel’s software team, focused on real business tasks and not artificial tests. These real numbers give HP more concrete productivity and resource usage pitches to companies looking for clear value before upgrading their PCs and for guidance on which AI PCs to choose.

Intel’s Engineering Push Shows a Strategic Shift

Part of the reason for these improvements is that Intel did not just provide the chips. The company also helped optimize software for them: Engineers from Intel’s Client Computing Group worked hand-in-hand with HP’s commercial PC team to tune performance across CPU, GPU, and NPU, reflecting Intel’s more rounded approach to AI workload resource management in their PC systems. Unlike Qualcomm, which has so far prioritized energy-efficient NPUs for AI workloads, Intel has taken a less NPU-centric approach with a more balanced total system performance between NPU and GPU – a potentially less power-efficient but more flexible system design strategy.

By focusing on key AI apps that business users rely on and ensuring they run well locally, Intel is also carving out a space for itself against ARM-based rivals like Apple, who still lean more on cloud computing than on-device capabilities.

While this kind of collaboration between device OEMs and chipmakers isn’t unusual, the deep focus on how partnerships like this could drive more explicit differentiation between platforms and PC brands could become the new normal for silicon and PC OEM partnerships. (We saw a similar effort between Intel and Lenovo last year with Lenovo’s Aura Edition PCs.) Broadly, Intel’s move toward working with PC OEMs to build systems for specific workloads and help optimize PCs for critical use cases, especially in the commercial segment, suggests that Intel understands that it can’t just put out parts for PCs anymore and expect orders to roll in – even in the Enterprise. The introduction of AI PCs has changed the dynamics of the PC market about as much as the arrival of Windows-on-Arm systems, and Intel understands that to hold on to its slipping market share, it needs to give PC buyers – consumers, in the SMB space, and the Enterprise – a reason not to select another platform.

For HP, the equation is somewhat similar: If Intel is pursuing deep partnerships with other PC OEMs to deliver uniquely tuned AI PCs for critical user categories, HP needs to do the same. This announcement signals that HP is in Intel’s inner circle and that it has uniquely optimized PCs to offer discerning customers with specific performance demands.

On-Device AI Boosts Privacy and Builds Trust

Running LLMs and productivity tools locally can make systems faster and more responsive and also frees users from the constraints of cloud services, connectivity limitations, and bandwidth challenges. An additional advantage is that running workloads locally is also more secure, as data being processed locally is easier to protect from interception and snooping. Two of the most important advantages of AI PCs are that they boost data privacy and security. And while still under-indexed, these privacy and performance benefits could help drive adoption in areas like finance, government, and healthcare, where trust is critical and data security rules are more stringent.

The challenge for now is that many of today’s most important productivity tools are still cloud-based, making AI PCs (particularly Copilot+ PCs) far too reliant on cloud-based AI processing than they need to be. In short, the hardware is ready, but many software platforms remain, with their AI workloads primarily cloud and subscription-based. This doesn’t mean organizations shouldn’t buy AI PCs now as part of their PC refresh schedule. What it does mean, however, is that the security and productivity gains promised by AI PCs may not fully materialize for some time yet.

AI PCs Still Early in the Game

While Intel’s Core Ultra chips offer solid local performance, many companies are waiting for the Panther Lake processor refresh (late 2025) and the Nova Lake processor (2026), which promise considerable performance improvements (50-80 Trillion Operations Per Second / TOPS on the NPU, with total system TOPS reaching for the 200 range). Again, these performance improvements are mostly academic at this point, since most AI-intensive applications continue to be cloud-based by default. That being said, when we start seeing some of these AI workloads truly shift to being handled on-device, these systems will be ready to deliver.

The current gap between system capabilities and what is operationally possible at the moment is the primary reason why demand for AI PCs from commercial PC buyers hasn’t been more aggressive. But this HP-Intel effort makes a solid case for these systems, especially for companies thinking about buying PCs that will be AI-ready when critical AI-accelerated productivity software starts to expand from the cloud to devices.

With over 500 hours of joint testing, HP has a data-backed case to make as one of the first movers in this space – helping shift AI PCs from theory to practice.

What to Watch:

HP’s success hinges on translating benchmarking gains into repeatable outcomes across a wider portfolio of enterprise workflows.

Intel’s momentum in this space could be challenged by AMD’s Ryzen AI 300 Series and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X platform, both of which are gaining OEM traction.

Enterprise customers may wait for higher TOPS performance from the upcoming Nova Lake and Panther Lake processors before scaling AI PC deployments.

The real-world gains showcased in HP’s testing will need to extend beyond launch partners to convince the broader enterprise market.

The news has stirred massive attention on social media and across digital platforms: two new items are coming, and one of them marks the long-awaited return of a fan favorite that hasn’t been seen in years. The company will launch the brand-new Spicy McMuffin, a fiery twist on McDonald’s classic breakfast item.

But that’s not all: on Thursday, July 10, 2025, the long-missed Snack Wrap will make its official comeback — a return that fans of the McDonald’s menu have been hoping for since 2016.

What is the new Spicy McMuffin from McDonald’s?

The Spicy McMuffin is McDonald’s latest offering to add heat to its morning lineup. The product maintains the core ingredients of the Egg McMuffin — an English muffin, egg, and cheese — but elevates the experience with a peppery hot sauce, perfect for those who like to kick off the day with bold flavor. It will also be available as a Spicy Sausage McMuffin and a Spicy Sausage McMuffin with Egg.

This isn’t McDonald’s first time flirting with heat. The brand previously won praise for its Spicy Chicken McNuggets, a limited-time item that became an instant hit. Now, McDonald’s continues its tradition of bold innovation, embracing spicy options that satisfy adventurous palates.

Snack Wrap: The Comeback Fans Never Gave Up On

The return of the Snack Wrap has generated genuine excitement among American customers. It’s a product that disappeared from the national menu in 2016 but never left the hearts of fans. Over the years, social media was flooded with nostalgic posts, memes, and even formal petitions begging McDonald’s to bring it back.

Now, finally, the Snack Wrap is back — and this time, it’s a permanent menu item. It features one of the brand-new McCrispy Strips, juicy all-white meat chicken, combined with shredded lettuce, cheese, and sauce, all wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.

Consumers can choose between two flavors:

Spicy Snack Wrap – with a habanero-inspired kick straight from the popular Spicy McCrispy sandwich.

Ranch Snack Wrap – with creamy garlic and onion notes that bring out that classic ranch flavor.

To make things even better, the Snack Wrap will be available à la carte or as part of a combo meal, including two Snack Wraps, medium fries, and a drink — all starting at just $2.99 USD.

McDonald’s openly acknowledged that consumer demand made the difference. In the company’s words: “They’re the ones who inspired us to make its return to the menu happen.” This initiative is part of McDonald’s broader effort to strengthen emotional connections with customers and respond more directly to their preferences.

McDonald’s by the Numbers: A Global Powerhouse

According to data from Statista, McDonald’s generated $25.92 billion USD in global revenue in 2024, with franchise restaurant sales reaching $120.93 billion. In its largest market, the United States, the company surpassed $10.4 billion in revenue that same year.

The company also continues to invest in its brand. In 2024, McDonald’s allocated $445 million USD to global advertising, and reported over 175 million active users in its loyalty program. This highlights a marketing strategy built on personalized experiences and deep emotional engagement with its global audience.

McDonald’s is also recognized as the most valuable restaurant brand in the world as of 2025, with an estimated brand value of $40.5 billion USD, surpassing Starbucks and KFC.

Why is this McDonald’s big announcement menu so important?

This important announcement is more than a publicity stunt — it marks a major milestone in how McDonald’s listens to and engages with its customers. By introducing the Spicy McMuffin and bringing back the beloved Snack Wrap, McDonald’s is showing that it’s in tune with modern tastes and nostalgia alike.

As consumer demand shapes menus more than ever, McDonald’s proves it’s ready to evolve without losing sight of its roots. This big announcement about the menu not only refreshes product offerings — it reinforces McDonald’s position as an industry leader that delivers what fans truly want.

Buy Signal: - The recall's limited scope and proactive management suggest Mondelez's brand trust is intact.
If input costs persist beyond 2025, growth could stall.
Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility.","Mondelez International's voluntary recall of specific RITZ Peanut Butter Cracker Sandwich products in July 2025—a precautionary move to address mislabeling risks for peanut allergy sufferers—has reignited debates about the snack giant's operational resilience and brand trustworthiness. While the recall itself is narrow in scope, its implications for supply chain management, consumer safety, and financial performance warrant scrutiny. For investors, the question is clear: Does this incident underscore Mondelez's agility in managing risks, or does it expose vulnerabilities that could undermine its long-term growth?

The Recall: A Contained Risk, but a Strategic Litmus Test

The recall, affecting only select carton sizes (8-, 20-, and 40-packs of peanut butter crackers and a variety pack) with “Best When Used By” dates between November 2025 and January 2026, stemmed from a supplier error in film packaging rolls. This defect could have led to peanut butter-filled crackers being labeled as cheese varieties, posing a severe risk to allergy-sensitive consumers. While no injuries were reported, the recall underscores the criticality of supplier quality control in Mondelez's global supply chain.

Mondelez's swift response—issuing a voluntary recall, establishing a 24/7 consumer hotline, and collaborating with the FDA—demonstrates a commitment to consumer safety. However, the incident raises questions about oversight of third-party suppliers, particularly in high-risk areas like allergen labeling. For a company whose brand equity relies heavily on trust (think Oreo, Cadbury, and belVita), such lapses could erode confidence among vulnerable customer segments.

Financial Performance: The Recall's Minimal Impact, but Bigger Storms Loom

The recall's financial consequences appear negligible. Analysts estimate the affected products represent a tiny fraction of Mondelez's $36.4 billion 2024 revenue, and the company has not disclosed recall-related costs in its Q1 2025 results. Instead, the quarter's struggles—organic revenue growth of 3.1% versus a 3.5% expectation, and a 23% year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS to $0.74—were driven by macroeconomic headwinds like cocoa cost inflation (up 70% year-on-year) and unfavorable currency impacts.

Mondelez's margin pressures are systemic, not recall-induced. Gross margins fell to 26.1% in Q1 2025, down 2,500 basis points year-on-year, as cocoa prices and transportation costs surged. The company is countering these challenges with pricing strategies (net pricing contributed 3.1% to organic revenue growth) and cost-cutting, including savings from its “Simplify to Grow” program. While the recall's impact is muted, investors must assess whether Mondelez can navigate broader inflationary pressures and sustain its 2025 outlook of a 10% adjusted EPS decline.

Analyst Optimism vs. Operational Realities: Where Does the Stock Stand?

Despite Q1's misses, analysts remain cautiously bullish. Institutions like BofA Securities and Stifel have raised price targets, citing Mondelez's ability to outperform consensus EPS estimates even amid margin contraction. The stock's beta of 0.49 signals lower volatility than the broader market, and its 19.7% six-month price return reflects investor confidence in its defensive snack business.

However, risks persist. Cocoa prices—Mondelez's largest raw material cost—remain volatile, and geopolitical tensions (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war) could further disrupt supply chains. The recall, while minor, highlights the need for Mondelez to invest in supplier audits and digital traceability systems to prevent future incidents.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip, but Mind the Risks

Mondelez's stock (MDLZ) currently trades at 21.5x 2025 adjusted EPS estimates, a discount to its five-year average P/E of 24.3. With a 2.3% dividend yield and a history of shareholder returns ($2.1 billion in buybacks and dividends in Q1 alone), the stock offers defensive appeal.

Buy Signal:

- The recall's limited scope and proactive management suggest Mondelez's brand trust is intact.

- Analysts' upward revisions and the company's reaffirmed 2025 guidance reflect confidence in its cost-saving and pricing strategies.

Hold or Sell Signal:

- Cocoa inflation and margin pressures remain unresolved. If input costs persist beyond 2025, growth could stall.

- A repeat of supply chain errors, especially involving safety-critical issues, could damage brand equity.

Conclusion: A Test of Strategic Muscle

Mondelez's peanut butter cracker recall is less a red flag and more a litmus test of its operational and strategic agility. While the incident underscores the importance of supplier oversight, the company's swift action and broader financial resilience suggest it can weather this storm. For investors, the stock presents a compelling entry point—if they're willing to bet on Mondelez's ability to navigate inflation and maintain its premium snack market dominance.",,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:49.767448

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger.
- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.
However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.
- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.","The $949 million legal judgment against CVS Health for its subsidiary Omnicare's fraudulent prescription practices marks a seismic moment for the healthcare sector. This ruling, which could ultimately cost CVS over $400 million in penalties and treble damages, exposes systemic governance failures and compliance risks that investors must now factor into their valuation of healthcare giants. For CVS, the verdict is not just a liability on its balance sheet—it's a stark warning about the consequences of merging under regulatory scrutiny and failing to address legacy liabilities.

The Legal Judgment: A Blueprint for Corporate Accountability

In April 2025, a federal jury found Omnicare liable for dispensing medications to elderly patients in long-term care facilities without valid prescriptions, resulting in over 3 million false claims submitted to Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. The damages of $135.6 million could triple under the False Claims Act (FCA), while penalties of up to $28,619 per claim could push total costs toward $949 million. Critically, the jury held CVS liable as the parent company for “causing” these violations by failing to address compliance gaps it knew about for years.

CVS's defense—that state laws permitted the practices and that it lacked direct control—was rejected. The court emphasized that as a holding company, CVS was obligated to enforce compliance under a 2016 Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA), which required oversight of Omnicare's operations. This ruling underscores a seismic shift: parent companies can no longer shield themselves from subsidiary misconduct under federal programs.

Regulatory Gaps and Governance Failures

The case reveals two critical governance flaws at CVS:

1. Lax Oversight Post-Acquisition: CVS acquired Omnicare in 2015, but internal audits and compliance reviews from 2016–2018 identified systemic issues, including “roll-over” prescriptions (assigning new prescription numbers to expired ones). Despite these findings, CVS did not mandate corrective actions, violating its CIA obligations.

2. Strategic Ambiguity: In 2022, CVS briefly explored selling Omnicare, recognizing its non-strategic value, but reversed course in 2023. This indecision suggests a lack of clarity about Omnicare's risks versus rewards—a red flag for investors in a sector where regulatory missteps can metastasize.

The Omnicare case also highlights broader industry risks. The jury's focus on “speaker programs” and kickbacks (echoed in a parallel Gilead Sciences settlement) signals that the DOJ is targeting financial incentives influencing prescribing practices—a trend that could expose other healthcare firms to similar liabilities.

Compliance Costs: A Hidden Drag on Valuations

The judgment's financial impact is immediate, but its operational consequences loom larger. CVS faces:

- Penalties and Litigation Costs: Beyond the $949 million estimate, ongoing appeals and settlements could drain cash reserves.

- Reputational Damage: Long-term care facilities may reduce CVS's market share, and federal programs could impose stricter oversight, raising compliance costs.

- Future Liabilities: Other subsidiaries or acquisitions may harbor similar risks, creating a “liability time bomb” for investors.

For investors, this demands a reevaluation of CVS's valuation multiples. The company trades at a P/E ratio of 12.5x, slightly above peers like UnitedHealth (11.8x) and Humana (14.2x). However, its higher legal exposure and governance risks may warrant a discount to reflect downside scenarios.

Investment Implications: Scrutinize Balance Sheet Resilience

Investors must ask two questions:

1. Can CVS absorb this hit without diluting shareholder value? Its $13 billion cash balance and $5 billion in annual free cash flow may cushion the blow, but sustained legal costs could strain its dividend (currently yielding 1.8%).

2. Is management accountable? CEO Karen S. Lynch has emphasized “operational discipline,” but the Omnicare verdict suggests governance gaps persist.

Actionable advice:

- Underweight CVS until management demonstrates a clear plan to address compliance risks and legacy liabilities.

- Compare to peers: Firms like AmerisourceBergen (ABC) or Cardinal Health (CAH), which face fewer regulatory headwinds, may offer safer exposure to healthcare distribution.

- Monitor DOJ actions: The Gilead settlement and ongoing scrutiny of speaker programs could amplify sector-wide compliance costs.

Conclusion: A New Era of Accountability

The Omnicare judgment is a watershed moment for healthcare giants. It signals that regulators and juries will hold parent companies directly responsible for subsidiary misconduct—a paradigm shift with far-reaching consequences. Investors must now treat corporate governance and compliance rigor as core valuation metrics, not afterthoughts. For CVS, the path to recovery hinges on transparency, proactive risk management, and a willingness to divest businesses with unsustainable liabilities. Until then, the stock remains a cautionary tale of how governance failures can unravel even the largest healthcare empires.

Final note: This case is not isolated. Investors should pressure all healthcare firms to disclose compliance frameworks and legacy risks, lest they face similar reckoning.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:07:40.141400

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal judge ordered CVS Health's Omnicare unit to pay $948.8 million in penalties and damages, in a whistleblower lawsuit claiming it fraudulently billed the U.S. government for invalid drug prescriptions.

In a Monday evening order, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan imposed a $542-million penalty for filing 3,342,032 false claims between 2010 and 2018.

McMahon also awarded $406.8 million of damages, representing three times the $135.6 million that a jury awarded on April 29.

The tripling was required under the federal False Claims Act, which lets whistleblowers sue on behalf of the federal government and share in recoveries.

CVS plans to appeal the judgment. The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager bought Omnicare in 2015. Omnicare has asked McMahon to throw out the case or grant a new trial.

""This lawsuit centered on a highly technical prescription dispensing recordkeeping issue that was allowed by law in many states,"" CVS said in a statement on Tuesday. ""There was no claim in this case that any patient paid for a medication they shouldn't have or that any patient was harmed.""

The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by Uri Bassan, a former Omnicare pharmacist in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and joined by the federal government in 2019.

They said Omnicare improperly billed Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, which serves military personnel, for prescriptions for tens of thousands of patients in assisted-living facilities, group homes for people with special needs, and other long-term care facilities.

Omnicare allegedly assigned new prescription numbers without necessary paperwork and pharmacist approvals, after the original prescriptions expired or ran out of refills.

McMahon rejected CVS' argument that a $948.8-million award violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against excessive fines under the Eighth Amendment.

""This was a very big fraud on the government, one that lasted over almost a decade, and one that Omnicare was aware of but avoided taking steps to correct,"" the judge wrote.

McMahon found CVS jointly liable with Omnicare for $164.8 million of the penalties, after jurors found it failed to stop Omnicare from submitting 30% of the false claims after buying that company. CVS itself did not submit any claims.

The case is U.S. ex rel Bassan v. Omnicare Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-04179.

TriHealth has signed an agreement to acquire the 140-bed Clinton Memorial Hospital, which would be the Ohio-based system’s sixth acute care hospital. The organizations said they will be working with state and county officials on regulatory clearances and will target a smooth transition for patients and staff.

Adventist HealthCare is no longer in the running to acquire Howard University Hospital, and five years of management services agreements between the organizations will be phased out from now until February 2026. Operations of Howard University Hospital will transition back to the university. The organizations said their decision was mutual, and Howard’s plan to build a new, updated hospital will not be interrupted.

University of Mississippi Medical Center wrapped up its acquisition of the 67-bed Merit Health Madison hospital from a Community Health Systems subsidiary. The deal, finalized May 1 but announced in June, sees the facility now operating as UMMC Madison.

Pender Community Hospital, a 31-bed critical access facility in Nebraska, board members voted to move forward on an affiliation agreement with Bryan Health. The hospital said affiliation will provide greater operational support, training for staff and “expertise in navigating the financial complexities of today’s healthcare environment.”

Phelps Health and Salem Memorial Hospital District, both in Missouri, have reportedly called off negotiations for a potential affiliation.

Aveanna Healthcare Holdings, a home-care provider, closed its $75 million acquisition of Thrive Skilled Pediatric Care, which runs 23 locations in seven states. The deal was funded with a combination of common stock shares and cash.

U.S. tariffs could pressure costs, though Levi’s management anticipates only a minimal impact on Q2 margins and is considering selective price increases. Organic revenue is expected to grow 3.5%–4.5% in Q2, with gross margin expanding by 80–100 basis points.

Levi’s Historical Odds Of Positive Post-Earnings Return

There are 17 earnings data points recorded over the last five years, with 9 positive and 8 negative one-day (1D) returns observed. In summary, positive 1D returns were seen about 53% of the time.

However, this percentage decreases to 33% if we consider data for the last 3 years instead of 5.

Median of the 9 positive returns = 4.2%, and median of the 8 negative returns = -7.7%

Correlation Between 1D, 5D, and 21D Historical Returns

A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves “long” for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector.","Court Order Signals Escalating Battle Over E-Commerce Giant's Market Power

The Competition Bureau of Canada has secured a Federal Court order compelling Amazon to turn over internal records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, marking a significant escalation in the regulator's investigation into potential abuse of dominance by the e-commerce giant.

The court order, announced Tuesday, advances a probe examining whether Amazon's pricing policies effectively suppress competition and inflate prices for Canadian consumers. The investigation focuses specifically on rules that allow Amazon to penalize third-party sellers who offer lower prices on competing platforms.

""This is a watershed moment for Canadian antitrust enforcement,"" said a competition policy expert familiar with the case. ""It's the first major deployment of the Bureau's expanded investigative powers under the amended Competition Act, and signals a new willingness to confront dominant digital platforms.""

Inside Amazon's Pricing Vise

At the heart of the investigation is Amazon's Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy, implemented in 2017, which gives the company broad authority to suppress listings or remove the coveted ""Buy Box"" from sellers whose products are priced lower elsewhere online.

While Amazon frames the policy as consumer protection against price gouging, critics view it as a sophisticated mechanism to cement market dominance. When sellers cannot offer better deals on competing platforms without risking visibility on Amazon—where many generate the bulk of their revenue—rival marketplaces struggle to gain traction.

The timing aligns with sweeping changes to Canada's competition regime. Recent amendments dramatically increased potential penalties for abuse of dominance to the greater of C$25 million, three times the ill-gotten gains, or an eye-watering 3% of global annual revenue—which for Amazon could theoretically reach US$19 billion based on 2024 figures.

""The Competition Bureau is finally showing its teeth,"" remarked an industry analyst who requested anonymity. ""With the new penalty ceiling tied to global revenue rather than just Canadian operations, the stakes have fundamentally changed for multinational platforms.""

Policy Battlefield: Protection or Predation?

Amazon's fair pricing rules create a complex economic calculus for the thousands of Canadian businesses selling through its platform.

""Many sellers feel trapped in a paradox,"" explained a consultant who advises e-commerce businesses. ""Amazon's policy nominally promotes price consistency, but effectively functions as a most-favored-nation clause that prevents price competition across platforms.""

For consumers, the implications cut both ways. While Amazon's dominant position—estimated at 40% of Canada's US$66 billion e-commerce market—has delivered convenience and seemingly competitive prices, the Bureau is examining whether those prices could be artificially inflated by restricted competition.

The investigation presents Amazon with a delicate balancing act. The company must defend policies it considers fundamental to marketplace integrity while navigating an increasingly hostile regulatory landscape. Amazon has not yet commented on the court order, though the Bureau emphasized no conclusion of wrongdoing has been reached.

Trade Tensions Cast Long Shadow

The investigation unfolds against a backdrop of escalating U.S.-Canada trade frictions, particularly regarding Canada's Digital Services Tax that primarily affects American tech giants. With former President Trump returning to office and renewing tariff threats, the Amazon probe takes on additional geopolitical significance.

""There's undeniably a political dimension to this timing,"" observed a trade policy specialist. ""Canadian regulators are asserting sovereignty over their digital economy while facing pressure from Washington to tread carefully with American companies.""

This dynamic creates unusual investment considerations, as regulatory outcomes could be influenced by diplomatic calculations beyond the traditional antitrust framework.

Market Impact: Beyond the Headline Risk

For investors, the investigation presents both immediate concerns and longer-term strategic implications.

While the theoretical penalty ceiling is massive, precedent suggests a more modest outcome. ""The largest abuse-of-dominance administrative monetary penalty ever imposed in Canada is approximately C$100 million,"" noted a financial analyst specializing in regulatory risk. ""Even with political pressures, I'd handicap the cash impact between C$100-250 million, with an extreme scenario capped around C$1 billion.""

The more significant market impact may come from behavioral remedies rather than monetary penalties. If Amazon is forced to relax its pricing policy, the competitive landscape could shift substantially.

""We're likely to see higher multi-channel pricing dispersion if the Fair Pricing Policy weakens,"" predicted a portfolio manager tracking the e-commerce sector. ""That benefits multi-channel enablers like Shopify and potentially creates openings for traditional retailers with strong online operations—Walmart Canada, Canadian Tire, and Costco could all see margin improvements.""

The Road Ahead: Inflection Point for Digital Regulation

The Competition Bureau's next steps will be closely watched. Amazon has 30 days to comply with the document production order unless it seeks judicial review. Should the Bureau proceed to file an application with the Competition Tribunal, the case would move from investigation to litigation.

Critically, as of June 20, 2025, private parties can now file civil abuse-of-dominance claims under recent amendments—opening the door for competitors or affected sellers to pursue their own cases against Amazon.

""This could become a perfect storm of regulatory pressure,"" warned a corporate governance advisor. ""Public enforcement combined with private litigation creates unprecedented uncertainty for Amazon's Canadian operations.""

Investment Outlook: Positioning for Regulatory Outcomes

For traders navigating this regulatory uncertainty, several strategic approaches merit consideration.

A pairs trade going long Shopify while shorting Amazon could capitalize on Canadian sellers diversifying their channel strategy. Traditional retailers with established e-commerce operations may see relief rallies if Amazon voluntarily relaxes its pricing policies to avoid protracted litigation.

Paradoxically, any significant stock price decline in Amazon specifically tied to Canadian regulatory headlines likely presents a buying opportunity, as the financial impact—even in worst-case scenarios—represents only a fraction of the company's global operations and cash flow.

""The market consistently overreacts to headline regulatory risk,"" suggested an institutional investor. ""Smart money will focus on the structural remedies rather than the theoretical maximum penalties.""

Investors should recognize that this case potentially marks a turning point in how digital platforms are regulated globally. Canadian precedents could influence ongoing investigations in the EU and U.S., creating regulatory contagion that ultimately reshapes the competitive dynamics of online marketplaces.

Investment Thesis

SectionKey PointsWhat Happened- On 8 July 2025, the Competition Bureau forced Amazon to disclose records related to its Marketplace Fair Pricing Policy (MFPP).

- The Bureau is investigating if MFPP allows Amazon to (i) raise fees/prices, (ii) block rivals, or (iii) both.

- No wrongdoing found yet—this is an evidence-gathering step.Legal Changes- Abuse of dominance penalties now capped at C$25M, 3× benefit, or 3% global revenue (vs. C$10M pre-2022).

- Private lawsuits allowed from 20 June 2025 (AMP + damages).

- Compulsory disclosure now applies to market studies (used here).Financial Exposure- Global sales (2024): US$638B; 3P seller services: US$156B.

- Estimated Canadian GMV: ~US$26B.

- Potential AMP cap: Up to US$19.1B (3% global sales) or US$3.9B (3× benefit).

- Realistic penalty estimate: C$100-250M (70% chance), up to C$1B in extreme cases.Probability-Weighted Outcomes- 30%: Co-operative remedy (<C$50M + policy tweaks).

- Buy AMZN dip: If penalty <US$1B (minor earnings impact).Next Steps- Amazon’s 30-day deadline to comply or appeal.

- Bureau’s decision to escalate to litigation.

- Private lawsuits possible after 20 June 2025.

- FTC timeline (Q4 2025) may sync with Canada’s case.

- U.S. election (Nov 2025) could trigger tariff risks.Bottom Line- Market underestimates risk due to new penalty scale (global revenue-based) and private lawsuits.

- Likely outcome: Conduct remedy (not huge fines), but long-term impact on Amazon’s pricing power.

- Opportunity: Buy AMZN dips; Shopify and multi-channel sellers may benefit.

Dive Brief:

Starbucks is offering performance-based compensation awards for executives tied to the Back to Starbucks plans, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 29.

The awards, which have a target value of $6 million, consist of a grant of performance-based restricted stock units that vest after fiscal year 2027.

Executives will receive the stock grants if the company meets cost-reduction goals, and leaders can earn twice the money if Starbucks hits additional goals related to “(i) the rollout of the Company’s Green Apron Service program, (ii) coffeehouse uplifts, (iii) new food and beverage platforms, and (iv) a reimagined Starbucks Rewards program,” according to the 8-K.

Dive Insight:

The stock awards show that among Starbucks’ key goals for the next two years, reducing costs is its highest priority. The additional goals are part of CEO Brian Niccol’s effort to renovate the brand and return its focus to the shopfloor.

The Green Apron Service model, for instance, “combines and unifies new service standards and expectations, changes to partner plays and deployment, streamlined routines, and our order sequencing algorithm,” Niccol said on the brand’s fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call.

Starbucks is in the middle of a transition toward an on-premise, coffeehouse focus. The early steps of that plan included the return of ceramic mugs for in-store orders, the restoration of the condiment coffee bar, improved seating, and handwritten notes on cups, according to the earnings call.

But going forward, Starbucks will renovate large numbers of cafes to meet new, warmer design standards. Niccol said on the earnings call that the chain was balancing the need for renovations with cost: “uplifts feel premium, but keep renovation costs down and minimize closure days.”

Starbucks also has cut a large number of menu items, but the new incentives signal the brand has a long-range strategy to use new menu items to draw in consumers. This menu strategy is likely to include coffee-forward beverages, in keeping with Niccol’s narrowed idea of the brand’s identity. The relatively new ristretto beverage platform is a good example of what a coffeehouse-focused menu innovation move might look like.

The changes to the rewards program, meanwhile, likely mean a shift away from aggressive discounting, given Niccol’s comments on the most recent earnings call. Starbucks, he said, had been discounting too much through its rewards program and was trying to build up transactions through the program that are not based on discounting.

“This transaction will address our global clients’ needs for Agentic AI-driven process transformation to deliver efficiency and agility through hyper-automation, while achieving superior business outcomes,” Murugesh told businessline, adding that Capgemini and WNS will together create a leader in Intelligent Operations, a solution that helps organisations transform activities and processes from back to front office by leveraging intelligent automation, decision intelligence, backed by data, AI and technology.

Murugesh said this will uniquely position the companies to support organisations in their AI-powered business process transformation, blending the capabilities needed from consulting, technology and platforms, to deep process and industry expertise.

When asked about workforce rationalisation, WNS said it maintains a strong presence in New York, London, and India, and is fully committed to all its markets.

“Our geographies are largely complementary to Capgemini’s. Until closing, which we expect to occur by the end of the year, Capgemini and WNS will continue to operate as independent companies. There are no immediate operational changes,” said Murugesh.

In the past, companies like Infosys have acquired BPM companies like Progeon Ltd to offer their clients a complete cost-effective solution based on service and technology outsourcing.

However, Sanchit Vir Gogia, Chief Analyst and CEO at Greyhound Research, pointed out that the Capgemini-WNS merger implies tighter coupling between AI engines and process delivery.

“This may benefit enterprises looking to embed GenAI across operations — invoice scanning, underwriting, agent assistance. But it could also mean less flexibility to run those processes independently or plug them into third-party clouds and AI systems,” said Gogia.

In sectors like insurance and utilities, where WNS has deep traction, platform gravity is especially strong. If Capgemini folds those vertical solutions into its broader transformation narratives, clients may see more value — but also more lock-ins. Early signals suggest WNS will retain its identity as a Business Services unit, but buyers will watch closely for changes in team structures and escalation paths, said Gogia.

Who: Kraft Heinz Foods Company is recalling 367,812 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original.

Why: The recall is due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Where: The recall is effective in the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

Kraft Heinz Foods Company has initiated a recall of more than 367,000 pounds of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original, produced between April 24 and June 11, 2025, and distributed across the United States, the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes.

Therecall was announced on July 2 by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

The affected products include 12-ounce, 36-ounce and 48-ounce packages of Oscar Mayer Turkey BACON ORIGINAL, with specific universal product codes and “use by” dates ranging from July 18, 2025, to Sept. 4, 2025. The products also bear lot codes RS19, RS40 or RS42 and display the USDA mark of inspection on their labels.

Consumers urged to check refrigerators and not to consume products, recall states

The potential contamination was identified through laboratory testing conducted by Kraft Heinz, which indicated the presence of Listeria monocytogenes.

Kraft Heinz urges consumers to check their refrigerators and freezers for the recalled products and advises not to consume the affected items.

“Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection,” the recall notice states. Listeriosis can lead to severe health issues, particularly in older adults, individuals with weakened immune systems and pregnant women and their newborns.

Kraft Heinz is actively working to address the issue by notifying retailers and ensuring the recalled products are removed from shelves.

Consumers seeking more information can contact Kraft Heinz’s consumer hotline at 1-800-280-7185 or email consumerrelations@kraftheinz.com. Additionally, the FSIS website provides updates on the Kraft Heinz turkey bacon recall and retail distribution lists.

Kraft Heinz says it has not received any reports of illness or injury related to the recall so far. The company is not currently facing legal action over the recall, but Top Class Actions follows recalls closely as they sometimes lead to class action lawsuits.

Recently, Boar’s Head Provisions Co. agreed to a $3.1 million settlement to resolve class action claims that it sold recalled meat products contaminated with listeria.

AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI.
Including AI and data in HR skills strategies HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies.
Don’t forget the human element To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity.","For the first time in history, we're witnessing up to five generations working side by side – the silent generation, baby boomers, Gen X, millennials and Gen Z – with Gen Alpha also about to enter employment age.

All these generations are currently facing a common challenge: learning how to use AI effectively in the workplace. As generative AI adoption accelerates across enterprises, upskilling a multigenerational workforce presents a unique opportunity for HR leaders to improve productivity and engagement. Perceptions of AI and approaches to learning differ across the generations, so how can organisations equip employees of different age groups with the right skills to succeed in the age of AI?

Changing perceptions

One of the first hurdles is shifting the perception that AI is intimidating or overly complex, which could impact adoption in groups who don't consider themselves 'digitally savvy’. To change these perceptions, HR leaders need to empower employees to lead this transformation.

Today’s workforce has successfully navigated multiple technological disruptions. The AI revolution is simply the latest development. The technology promises to automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time to focus on strategic work. This makes experience and business insight valuable attributes for employees. At Capgemini, I've seen many older colleagues embrace this change and sign up for AI training.

Redesigning career pathways

More than half of business leaders (56 per cent) and employees (54 per cent) believe AI is transforming how they work, according to Capgemini research. This will require reshaping job functions and workflows across all organisational levels.

But it can be hard to determine the skills employees will need to adapt to these new ways of working. HR leaders must re-evaluate workforce planning, roles and career pathways in light of the changes AI might bring.

Success depends on how well employees across generations integrate AI into their daily work. Only 16 per cent of employees report receiving ample support to develop generative AI skills and 46 per cent of leaders have been through formal Gen AI training.

As modern businesses navigate a landscape defined by significant technological change, they must cultivate the right skills across all age groups to harness AI effectively.

Embracing continuous learning and inclusive upskilling

A blanket approach to upskilling risks overwhelming employees and widening inequalities. Instead, HR functions need to embed learning as a continuous part of work, not an additional burden.

Embedding AI training into everyday workflows normalises learning and ensures all employees can train at their own pace according to their career goals. AI literacy training should focus on integrating job-specific knowledge with critical thinking, providing hands-on opportunities to engage with Gen AI. These initiatives can empower employees of any age to take on more strategic roles and enhance their sense of purpose.

Moreover, AI itself can facilitate accessibility by simplifying complex processes and bridging skill gaps between generations. Contrary to stereotypes, older professionals often find AI to be a great equaliser. Many AI tools feature intuitive interfaces that are accessible for people from all age groups. This allows experienced employees to leverage their deep industry knowledge alongside AI, potentially giving them an advantage over more tech-savvy but less experienced colleagues. The key lies in recognising individual strengths rather than relying on generational labels and promoting cross-generational learning between younger and older employees.

Including AI and data in HR skills strategies

HR leaders must embrace AI and data to inform skills strategies. Age-inclusion efforts require regular audits of engagement, promotion, skills proficiency and performance data.

Continuous employee feedback is also important for understanding the effectiveness of AI training programmes. This enables HR professionals to identify skills gaps, areas of improvement and biases, which helps ensure equitable development opportunities for everyone.

AI tools can also create a level playing field in recruitment and performance evaluation by removing human bias. This shift benefits older professionals particularly, creating more opportunities for career progression and meaningful contribution to the workplace.

Another important factor to consider is enabling employees to share their experiences and learn from each other. Creating forums such as multigenerational internal networks enables employees to share experiences and demystify age-related stereotypes.

Reverse mentoring, where younger employees guide older colleagues on new technologies, is another way to encourage intergenerational collaboration.

Don’t forget the human element

To succeed in the age of AI, HR leaders must ensure AI adoption respects and enhances human judgement, empathy and creativity. This tandem approach creates a workforce that is technically skilled, resilient, adaptable and connected.

As organisations face an unpredictable future, HR's role in guiding inclusive adoption of AI becomes paramount. By fostering environments where multigenerational teams thrive through mutual respect, tailored development and continuous learning, businesses can unlock innovation and gain a competitive advantage in the age of AI.",https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/150/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/OMP/CarolynMillerCorpPhotoHeadshotholly.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 17:05:31.462288

The unions reached the agreement following what they said were more than 40 hours of talks with the grocers. UFCW locals 135, 324, 770, 1167, 1428 and 1442 took part in the talks that led to the tentative agreement, which would cover workers for Kroger’s Ralphs banner and Albertsons’ namesake banner as well as its Vons and Pavilions supermarket chains.

The agreement comes just weeks after workers for the grocery chains voted to authorize an unfair labor practice strike to protest what labor leaders from UFCW Locals 324 and 770 described as “labor violations throughout negotiations that have prevented workers from getting the fair contract they deserve.”

The alleged infractions by Kroger and Albertsons included “breaking the law by surveilling and interrogating employees in their stores, interfering with their discussions with union representatives, equating union support with disloyalty, and preventing them from wearing union insignia,” UFCW Local 770 said in a June 27 statement.

Albertsons said in a statement that the unfair labor practice allegations “are without merit,” adding that it remains ""committed to productive discussions with the UFCW.”

Significant unmet need in schizophrenia care: With up to 2.8 million US adults affected by schizophrenia and only 40% receiving adequate treatment, Caplyta may help fill a critical treatment gap.

Johnson & Johnson announced that it has submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA, seeking an expanded indication for Caplyta (lumateperone) to include relapse prevention in schizophrenia. According to the company, the sNDA is based on positive data from a Phase III randomized withdrawal trial, which demonstrated that Caplyta significantly prolonged time to relapse compared to placebo.1

How Effective is Caplyta in Preventing Schizophrenia Relapse?

“For people living with schizophrenia, relapses can be devastating as they disrupt lives, undo hard-earned treatment progress toward patients’ goals, and increase the risk of hospitalization with each episode,” said Christoph U. Correll, MD, clinical professor of psychiatry, Zucker School of Medicine, Hofstra/Northwell, New York, in a press release. “Caplyta substantially lowers the chance of relapse for patients compared to placebo, which is often a major source of anxiety and suffering for them and their families.”

Phase III Trial Results Support Expanded Indication

The double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of Caplyta compared to placebo.

The primary endpoint of the trial was time to relapse during the 26-week double-blind treatment phase. The key secondary endpoint was delayed time to all-cause discontinuation, including relapse.

Results show that time to relapse was significantly longer in patients receiving Caplyta compared to those receiving placebo (p=0.0002). Patients treated with Caplyta demonstrated a 63% reduction in risk of relapse compared to placebo (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.37, [0.22, 0.65]).

Caplyta also demonstrated a significantly delayed time to all-cause discontinuation compared to placebo during the double-blind phase (p=0.0007).

Headache was the most common adverse event, occurring in at least 5% of patients and at twice the rate seen with placebo.

The safety profile of Caplyta was consistent with previous studies and no new safety signals were identified.1

Global and US Schizophrenia Burden Underscores Unmet Need

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 24 million people are affected by schizophrenia globally, which is equal to approximately one in every 222 people. Those affected by schizophrenia are two to three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, primarily due to physical illnesses such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases. Onset is most common between late adolescence and the twenties, with men typically experiencing earlier onset than women.

Currently, half of patients in mental health facilities are living with schizophrenia; however, only 31.3% of people with schizophrenia receive specialist mental health care. WHO suggests that mental health facilities are not currently providing effective care for patients with schizophrenia.2

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the prevalence of schizophrenia in the United States is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.64%.3 According to Johnson & Johnson, this equates to 2.8 million adults, with around 40% receiving proper medical care. It is also estimated that patients with schizophrenia experience around nine relapses over the course of six years.1

Long-Term Data Reinforce Caplyta’s Role in Neuropsychiatric Care

“Relapse prevention is a critical goal for the long-term care and management of this debilitating disorder,” said Bill Martin, PhD, global therapeutic area head, neuroscience, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, in the press release. “These Phase III results provide compelling evidence of meaningful relapse prevention, which is critical in preserving long-term patient stability, breaking the cycle of hospitalization, and helping to control symptom progression. We’re committed to building on the decade of research reinforcing the robust efficacy, proven safety, and favorable tolerability of Caplyta and providing additional data to support the long-term use of this medicine in neuropsychiatric disorders.”

As the luxury automaker grapples with slowing demand in key markets, geopolitical tensions, and the costly shift to electrification, its ability to balance innovation with financial discipline will determine its future. Here's how Porsche is adapting—and whether investors should bet on its resilience.

Product Innovation: Electrification as a Double-Edged Sword

Porsche's push into electrification is both a strategic imperative and a financial burden. The all-electric Macan, launched in 2024, has become a critical growth driver, accounting for 14% of deliveries in early 2025. The model's success—14,185 units sold in Q1 alone—highlights consumer appetite for high-performance EVs. Porsche also plans an all-electric Cayenne, its best-selling model, by 2026, signaling its commitment to electrifying its core lineup.

However, this transition is costly. Special expenses for 2025 have surged to €1.3 billion, up from €800 million, due to battery tech investments and supply chain adjustments. The company acquired a majority stake in V4Smart GmbH & Co. KG to secure lithium-ion round cells, while its partnership with Varta AG aims to stabilize battery production. These moves underscore Porsche's resolve to control its supply chain—a necessity in an era of global competition for EV components.

Yet Porsche is hedging its bets. It has delayed plans to independently scale high-performance battery production via its subsidiary Cellforce Group, opting instead to focus on partnerships. This pragmatism reflects a recognition that electrification's ROI requires patience.

Market Challenges: Balancing Global Demand and Geopolitical Risks

Porsche's sales data reveal stark regional disparities. In Q1 2025, deliveries fell 7.9% globally to 71,470 units, driven by a 42% decline in China, its second-largest market. Intense competition in China's luxury EV segment—where local brands like NIO and Li Auto dominate—has forced Porsche to adopt a “value over volume” strategy. This means prioritizing brand prestige over mass sales, even as rivals undercut prices.

Meanwhile, North America saw a 37% surge in deliveries to 43,577 vehicles in H1 2025, partly offsetting losses elsewhere. Yet U.S. import tariffs imposed in April 2025 have strained margins, contributing to Porsche's revised 2025 forecasts.

The stock, down 12% year-to-date as of Q2 2025, reflects investor skepticism about near-term profitability. But Porsche's long-term focus on premium differentiation—via bespoke options like its Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur (offering over 1,000 customization choices)—could insulate it from price wars.

Financial Adjustments: Cost-Cutting to Offset Short-Term Pain

Porsche's financial adjustments are aggressive. The company aims to cut 3,900 jobs by 2029 through attrition and voluntary retirement programs, while halting fixed-term contracts for 2,000 roles. The “Road to 20” cost-reduction program targets a return to its long-term goal of >20% operating margins, down from 14.1% in 2024.

Revised 2025 forecasts reveal the trade-off: Sales revenue is now projected at €37–38 billion (vs. an earlier €39–40 billion), with operating margins dropping to 6.5–8.5% (from 10–12%). Yet Porsche is prioritizing structural health over short-term gains. CFO Dr. Jochen Breckner emphasized that these measures are “sustainably strengthening Porsche for the future.”

Investment Considerations: Is Now the Time to Bet on Porsche?

Porsche's strategy is clear: double down on EVs and exclusivity while cutting costs to preserve margins. But investors must weigh risks:

- Geopolitical Uncertainty: Supply chain disruptions, trade wars, and China's regulatory shifts could prolong headwinds.

- EV Adoption Speed: A slower-than-anticipated shift to electric vehicles could strain cash flows.

- Brand Dilution: Expanding EVs without sacrificing Porsche's “high-performance” identity is a tightrope walk.

The Bull Case: Porsche's brand equity, premium pricing power, and disciplined cost management could position it as a leader in luxury EVs. Its partnerships in battery tech and the delayed Cellforce expansion suggest a smarter use of capital.

The Bear Case: Near-term profitability is under pressure, and competition—especially from Tesla's Model X/Y and local EV players—is intensifying.

Final Analysis

Porsche's resilience hinges on executing a delicate balance: accelerate electrification without overextending financially, maintain exclusivity in oversaturated markets, and adapt to geopolitical shifts. For investors, this is a long-term play. While short-term volatility persists, Porsche's strategic moves suggest it's building a foundation for sustained premium growth.

Recommendation: Hold for long-term investors with a 5+ year horizon, but avoid if seeking quick gains. Monitor EV adoption rates and China's regulatory environment closely—these will be the ultimate tests of Porsche's resilience.

Last month, U.S. District Judge James V. Selna tripled the damages in the case to $442 million, a practice enabled under federal antitrust law. In May, the jury had found in favor of Scottsdale, Arizona–based Innovative Health on all of the questions over whether J&J had violated sections of the federal Sherman Antitrust Act and California’s Cartwright Act through tying and other anticompetitive practices, allegedly maintaining a monopoly on cardiac mapping catheters and squeezing out reprocessors such as Innovative.

In its motion for summary judgment filed on July 3, J&J argues that the jury failed to make a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.

J&J’s lawyers said in the motion:

“The fundamental premise of IH’s tying theory was that Biosense possessed market power in a distinct market for clinical support services (a market that, as described below, was not shown). Biosense provided that service for free. This left IH to hang its case on the claim that Biosense used its market power to charge supracompetitive prices for its original equipment manufacturer … catheters in separate alleged single-brand catheter markets, thereby barring competition rather than simply competing with a competitor. But at trial, IH presented no evidence that Biosense was charging supracompetitive prices. As such, IH failed to demonstrate — because it cannot do so — market power and the exercise of such power to harm competition. In fact, the evidence showed that Biosense charged competitive prices, and the quality of these products continuously improved.”

In a motion replying to a separate motion seeking to prevent a permanent injunction, Innovative’s Health’s lawyers described Johnson & Johnson’s Biosense Webster as a proven monopolist. “Requiring Innovative to play litigation whack-a-mole against Biosense would thwart the Sherman Act’s purpose to protect market competition. Instead, it is well established that an injunction should issue to prevent ongoing or threatened violations of the antitrust laws.”",https://www.massdevice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gavel-Medtech.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 13:13:31.320115

Kraft Heinz recalls 360,000 pounds of turkey bacon over scary concerns

Kraft Heinz (KHC) , a company behind popular brands such as Kool-Aid, Jell-O, and Oscar Mayer, is recalling around 367,812 pounds of fully cooked turkey bacon that might have been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes.

Listeria is a type of bacteria that thrives in cool and damp environments, even at temperatures as low as 31°F. When food comes into contact with Listeria, the bacteria spreads quickly. It is most commonly found in luncheon meats, such as dry sausages and hot dogs, but also in raw milk, ham, chicken salads, and more.

What happens if you eat food contaminated with Listeria?

You can get listeriosis, an infection that can be serious. Consumers especially vulnerable to listeriosis are pregnant women and their newborns, older people (65+), and those with weakened immune systems.

Infection during pregnancy is hazardous and can even lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or life-threatening infection of the newborn, according to the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Pregnant women with listeriosis often only have fever and similar flu-like symptoms.

Those who are not pregnant might have headaches, stiff necks, fevers, muscle pain, loss of balance, and convulsions. While the first symptoms might appear in a few hours to three days after consuming contaminated food, sometimes they take up to 2 months to appear.

While healthy people can have mild symptoms when infected with Listeria, older people and those with weakened immune systems can die.

More than 90% of people with listeriosis end up hospitalized, often in intensive care units, according to data from the FDA.

FSIS urges shoppers not to consume these products

These products were shipped to retail stores across the country, and some even reached the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

No illnesses or adverse reaction to the consumption of these products have been reported, said FSIS, However, consumers concerned about an illness are advised to contact a health care provider.

FSIS fears some of these products might be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers, and it is urging buyers not to consume them, but to throw them away or return them to the place of purchase.

Hershey on Tuesday named Wendy’s chief executive Kirk Tanner as its next CEO effective Aug. 18, according to a company statement.

The announcement brings Tanner back to the CPG industry, where he spent more than three decades at PepsiCo. Among other senior roles, he served as CEO of PepsiCo Beverages North America, overseeing the growth of Pepsi, Gatorade and Mountain Dew.

Tanner replaces Michele Buck, who in January announced her intention to retire after eight years in Hershey’s top role. Buck will work closely with Tanner in a senior advisory capacity during the transition.

Dive Insight:

As CEO, Tanner will be responsible for building on Buck’s efforts to transform Hershey into a snacking powerhouse and diversify beyond sweets. Buck oversaw the company’s aggressive move into gummies and salty snacks and led some of the largest acquisitions in Hershey’s history, including a $1.6 billion purchase of SkinnyPop owner Amplify.

“Michele architected and championed Hershey’s Leading Snacking Powerhouse vision, guiding the company through multiple phases of transformational growth,” said Mary Kay Haben, lead independent director and chair of Hershey’s CEO Search Committee. “The impact of her courageous leadership, evolution of portfolio and capabilities, and authentic connection to people leave a legacy and a roadmap that positions Hershey well for the future.”

Still, Tanner joins at a precarious time for the snacking industry, which has experienced broad declines as consumers tighten their wallets and look for healthier alternatives. Hershey reported close to a 14% sales drop in the first quarter.

The candy giant also has struggled with higher cocoa costs amid fast-changing tariffs. The company expects tariffs to cost between $15 million and $20 million during the second quarter and asked the White House for an exemption for duties on cocoa.

At PepsiCo, Tanner led a transformation of the company's $28 billion beverage business, scaling brands, including Pure Leaf and bubly, and overseeing new innovation to address evolving consumer trends.

In addition to leading PepsiCo’s North American beverages business, Tanner also held several other senior leadership positions, including president of PepsiCo Global Foodservice and senior vice president of Frito-Lay North America’s West Division.

“Kirk is a proven, high-impact leader in the food and beverage industry with a great combination of customer and consumer passion, commercial acumen and operational scale,” Haben said. “His deep experience in snacks, beverages, M&A and innovation—combined with public company CEO and board roles—makes him well suited to lead Hershey into the future.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/orTfmCkfPC8KE1L8Cx1WZc6bLb8r3f249BI-ZXtaNEU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTUxMzI0Njk0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-08 14:12:53.207855

The products subject to recall bear the USDA mark of inspection on the front of the label. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide and some were exported to the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The problem was discovered after the establishment’s laboratory testing indicated the product may be contaminated with Lm.

There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. Anyone concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.

Consumption of food contaminated with Lm can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. Less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

Listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. An invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. In pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. In addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. Listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

FSIS is concerned that some products may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

Known as “Instacart Shoppers,” these workers play a valuable role in the grocery technology company’s ongoing growth in retail vendor space, as evidenced by the ongoing release of new earnings opportunities and safety features for them.

In its latest shareholder letter, Instacart said that it began piloting several new initiatives to provide its gig workers with more ways to earn money, including taking videos of store shelves to improve inventory transparency, letting them deliver customer orders from a distributor’s warehouse and allowing an Instacart shopper in one store the chance to find out-of-stock items from an order handled by another worker at another store.

Relying on its workers to track on-shelf inventory is “much more real-time than what we get from retailers,” then-CEO Fidji Simo told investors in February.

Along with earnings, Instacart has also revamped how it scores its workers. In April, the company unveiled plans to roll out a new tool that ranks how well its workers shop for customers with a sliding scale from “Needs work” to “Standard” to “Good” based on the number and condition of items the worker selected for their orders completed in the last 90 days.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure.","The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is undergoing a seismic shift from fossil fuel dependency to a sustainable energy future, driven by net-zero commitments, fiscal pragmatism, and geopolitical realignments. At the epicenter of this transformation is Standard Chartered, whose recent strategic moves under leaders like Philippe Tabouis and Abbas Husain position it as a pivotal financier of the region's $2 trillion clean energy pipeline. For investors, this presents a rare convergence of policy tailwinds, scalable financing tools, and underserved infrastructure demand—arguing for immediate allocation to infrastructure funds or ETFs exposed to MENA's renewable transition.

Leadership Pivot: Tabouis and Husain's Dual Play

Standard Chartered's infrastructure strategy is being steered by two key figures:

- Abbas Husain, Global Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance, focuses on structuring deals in renewables, green hydrogen, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) across MENA and EMEA. His team has pioneered sustainability-linked loans (SLLs) and green bond frameworks to align financing with environmental metrics.

- Philippe Tabouis, Head of Infrastructure and Development Finance in Europe, brings Société Générale's expertise in cross-border project finance. His mandate includes bridging European capital markets with MENA's energy transition, exemplified by his role in the $8.5 billion Neom Green Hydrogen Project in Saudi Arabia.

Together, they are leveraging Standard Chartered's network to capture first-mover advantage in sectors like green hydrogen (a $13 billion market by 2030) and solar/wind energy, which now account for 40% of new MENA power capacity.

The Renewable Energy Gold Rush

MENA's energy transition is not merely theoretical—it is already financing billions in projects:

1. Neom Green Hydrogen: Tabouis' team acted as mandated lead arranger for this landmark project, which will produce 1.2 million tons of green hydrogen annually using solar and wind power. The deal's success underscores the viability of large-scale green loans, which now command premium pricing due to their ESG alignment.

2. Saudi Solar Dominance: Standard Chartered has underwritten over $5 billion in solar projects in Saudi Arabia, including the 1.5 GW Sakaka Solar Plant. These projects are structured as PPPs, with sovereign wealth funds like Public Investment Fund (PIF) sharing risk with international investors.

3. Qatar's Petrochemical Evolution: Even in hydrocarbons, the bank is pivoting toward sustainability—its role in the Ras Laffan Petrochemicals project included green financing terms requiring reduced carbon intensity.

PPPs and Policy Liberalization: The EMEA Catalyst

Governments in the region are accelerating PPP frameworks to attract private capital, particularly for water infrastructure and digital connectivity:

- Abu Dhabi's Noor II Street Lighting Loan: A $200 million PPP deal structured by Standard Chartered, demonstrating how even smaller-scale projects can attract institutional investors through risk-sharing mechanisms.

- Desalination Plants: The Rawabi desalination project in Saudi Arabia, financed via green loans, highlights the bank's ability to monetize water scarcity—a $23 billion opportunity in MENA by 2030.

The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) are critical partners, co-financing deals and mitigating geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, policy reforms—such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Authority (PIA) privatization roadmap—are unlocking trillions in dormant infrastructure assets.

Financing the Transition: DFIs, ECAs, and Capital Markets

Standard Chartered's edge lies in its hybrid financing toolkit:

- Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs): These instruments, now used in 60% of the bank's MENA deals, tie interest rates to green targets (e.g., carbon reduction).

- Capital Market Refinancing: “Soft-mini perm” loans (short-term debt used to bridge to long-term bonds) are enabling projects like Neom to access yield-hungry bond markets.

- Institutional Investor Appetite: Over $2 trillion in global infrastructure capital is chasing MENA's pipeline, with Standard Chartered acting as a gateway for pensions and sovereign funds.

Note: STAN's outperformance since 2023 reflects growing demand for its regional expertise in sustainable finance.

Investment Thesis: Allocate Now to MENA's Green Pipeline

The convergence of policy momentum, capital market innovation, and underserved infrastructure demand creates a multi-year opportunity. Investors should prioritize:

1. Sector-Specific ETFs: The iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (IFRA) holds exposure to firms like Siemens Gamesa (wind) and Engie (utilities), while tracking projects in Saudi Arabia and Egypt.

2. Green Infrastructure Funds: BlackRock Global Renewable Power Fund and Morgan Stanley Sustainable Infrastructure Fund directly target PPPs in solar/wind and green hydrogen.

3. Geographic Plays: Allocate to ETFs like iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia ETF (SAUD), which benefits from the kingdom's $1.3 trillion energy transition plan.

Risk Factors: Geopolitical instability, delayed policy reforms, and overvaluation in crowded renewable sectors. Mitigate these by focusing on debt instruments (e.g., green bonds) or funds with local partner expertise.

Conclusion: The Next Decade's Infrastructure Alpha Lies in MENA

Standard Chartered's dual focus on Abbas Husain's dealmaking and Philippe Tabouis' cross-border structuring positions it as the region's banker of choice for green infrastructure. With DFIs, ECAs, and institutional capital now aligned, the time to act is now. Investors who allocate to MENA's renewable pipeline and EMEA's digital infrastructure will capture the next wave of returns in a world hungry for sustainable growth.

Note: MENA's share of global clean energy investment rose from 12% to 21% between 2023 and 2024—a trend likely to accelerate.",,N,,2025-07-08 16:09:08.224359

AI and machine learning are transforming private equity exit strategies by accelerating due diligence, enhancing portfolio monitoring and enabling faster, data-driven buyer analysis.

Advanced tech tools, including predictive analytics and ESG dashboards, not only support smarter investment decisions but also boost exit attractiveness by showcasing long-term value creation.

The mid-market and small-cap private equity sector is facing turbulence, driven by inflation and political instability, fueling uncertainty and volatility.

Due to this, firms are prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices, emerging markets and technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for quick and accurate investment calls.

Fundraising remains a challenge, with over 70% of investors citing economic uncertainty and market volatility as top concerns.

Globally, private equity firms are sitting on $2.1 trillion, which can be used for new opportunities (“dry powder”). Most firms have allocated 30% of their capital to dry powder amid cautious optimism.

At least 80% of private equity workflows already rely heavily on technologies to source deals, conduct due diligence and manage portfolios; 95% of these firms are planning to multiply AI investments in the next 18 months.

This reliance has led to an evolution in exit strategies. Secondary buyouts and management/leveraged buyouts are making the most headway. To curb uncertainty in the market and challenges pertaining to liquidity, firms are exploring continuation funds and preferred equity options.

The private equity industry, despite sitting on a lot of dry powder, is encountering insurmountable pressure from Limited Partners (LPs) for efficient allocation of capital. General Partners (GPs) find themselves caught up with due diligence demands and allocation requirements amid market contraction risks.

Technological advancements have become enablers with AI, robotic process automation (RPA) and blockchain driving operational efficiencies. This encourages compliance and helps with decision-making. S&P Global found that 41% of private equity firms are in nascent adoption stages, 13% are at the advanced implementation stage and 7% have fully integrated technology.

In deal sourcing, AI can identify 195 relevant companies in the time it would take a junior analyst to evaluate one. Firms like Blackstone and EQT are investing in solely owned platforms like EQT’s Motherbrain, which consolidates 140,000+ data points for real-time M&A insights.

AI also assists with post-deal requirements like live portfolio monitoring and exit readiness by putting together information for a quicker turnaround on the buyer analysis for decision-making. Firms that delay tech adoption risk falling behind in fundraising and corporate governance and risk being left behind by competitors. Simultaneously, these advances have a real-world impact on the people in the industry, reducing the need for entry-level employees.

The investment projectile has evolved across four major phases: workflow automation and BPM services (before 2018); low-code/no-code platforms (2018-2020); early adoption of intelligent automation across the value curve (2021-2023); and a new era of intelligent automation powered by generative AI (2024-present).

Private equity firms are embracing the tech revolution to drive digital operations and unlock value across sectors.

The allied risks and limitations

AI has a significant impact on the private equity space, although there are reservations about its adoption and scope in the future. In light of the limited adoption rate, it is clear that only a fraction of private equity firms are exploring AI application use cases. These reservations are emanating from cybersecurity threats, opaque workflows and limited visibility on returns.

Having said that, it does contribute to operational efficiency and better portfolio performance. It also supports analysis, given its ability to skim through large and complex data sets, and is useful to entry-level employees as a learning and development tool.

These tools do enhance accurate decision making without negating human judgement, allowing organizations to act swiftly with precision. This has a cascading effect on revenue optimization, cost reduction and improved performance reporting and monitoring. For example, AI can help monitor KPIs across portfolios and processes in deal exits and capital distribution.

However, this shift brings significant risks. Kearney highlights seven key scenarios: rising ownership costs, unreliable data, questionable model outputs, cyber threats, IP disputes, AI-driven ESG platform concerns and negative socioeconomic impacts – all amid evolving regulatory pressures on governance.

It also emphasizes the importance of establishing robust governance frameworks and ethical guidelines to mitigate these risks. For example, some firms have created internal compliance forums to define acceptable AI use and ensure data protection. To successfully integrate AI, private equity firms must align AI initiatives with strategic goals, focus on high-impact use cases and ensure their technology infrastructure is ready. Standardizing and improving data quality across portfolios is also critical, as inconsistent data remains a major barrier to effective AI deployment. Firms that invest in preparing their data and tailoring AI models to their specific needs will gain a competitive edge.

Propelling the ESG engine forward

Private equity firms are leveraging state-of-the-art technologies of AI-driven predictive analytics and powering ESG data platforms to monitor and integrate metrics into their investment strategies. According to EY, private equity funds that have a well-integrated ESG framework have the potential to achieve an initial rate of return, which could be 8% higher than their competitors. This is mainly thanks to more accurate predictive models that provide organizations with the ability to assess value creation potential and sustainability risks over long periods at both deal and portfolio levels.

Bain and Company reports that, despite a low adoption rate of ESG initially, there has been an uptick in interest due to the consistency of data ESG operations provide and its potential long-term assurances. Firms now leverage AI/ML and natural language processing (NLP) to assess regulatory disclosures, sentiment analysis and supply chain data for ESG risks. This approach allows investors to pursue short-term value while staying aligned with long-term goals, supporting broader global efforts by businesses and governments to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_380dG0pxQ_6C-WjpawAW_RWRAy00C8-rSZ5EpzZN6-0.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 12:24:35.900647
