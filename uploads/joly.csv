The seasonally adjusted S&P Global Greece Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 55.0 in March from 52.6 in February, signaling a significant improvement in operating conditions for Greek manufacturers.

A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth, while below 50 signals contraction.

The March data highlighted a notable uptick in demand, with new orders and export sales rising at the fastest pace in nearly a year, supported by stronger domestic and foreign demand.

That prompted manufacturers to increase their workforce at the sharpest rate since January 2022.

“Growth in the Greek manufacturing sector accelerated at the end of the first quarter, as the pace of expansion reached the strongest for almost a year,” said Sian Jones, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence:

“Improvements in demand conditions supported greater output, new orders, input buying and employment.”

However, inflationary pressures intensified, with input costs rising at the quickest rate since November 2022.

This led to a corresponding increase in selling prices as manufacturers passed on higher costs to customers.

Despite these challenges, manufacturers expressed optimism about future output growth, buoyed by expectations of continued demand strength and increased construction activity.

We believe that for food to be delicious, it first has to be real and made with the highest quality ingredients.
“Our customers deserve real food with real ingredients – and that’s exactly what's on the menu at McDonald’s.","At McDonald’s, we feed nearly 90% of the U.S. population every year. But have you ever wondered what it takes to serve real, delicious, and affordable food to 26 million Americans each day?

Behind every meal are the people making it possible: from the potato growers in Idaho, cattle ranchers in Texas, and bakers in Illinois, to the small business owners who operate restaurants in communities across the country.

We don’t take our role at the heart of American food lightly – and it’s why we’re continuously working to make it even better for the future. How do we do that? It starts with four promises.

1. We put quality first

The millions of Americans who visit us have high expectations—and rightly so. They want quality, delicious food. But too often, good food with real ingredients means compromising on price or convenience.

That’s not how we do things at McDonald’s. We use real ingredients, many of which are grown, raised, and harvested by local farmers and ranchers. From beef, chicken and fish to potatoes and eggs, it is something we’ll never compromise on. And our long-term relationships mean our suppliers can thrive and grow with us.

What’s not in our food is just as important. Our seven classic burgers—from our Big Mac® to the Quarter Pounder® with Cheese—contain no artificial preservatives or flavors, and no added colors from artificial sources (except the pickle).

The result? Delicious food you can feel good about enjoying:

We use 100% pure beef patties, seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper. We have two partners who have supplied our beef since the day we opened our very first restaurants.

Our Chicken McNuggets® are made with 100% white meat, with no artificial preservatives, colors or flavors. And customers love them: we sell about 700 million pounds of McNuggets every year.

All Filet-O-Fish sandwiches in the U.S. are made with 100% wild-caught Alaska Pollock from U.S. waters, the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands right off the coast of Alaska.

We use freshly cracked eggs on our Egg McMuffin® sandwiches—and all the eggs we source in the U.S. are 100% cage-free.

Our Happy Meal products make balanced meals more accessible by offering recommended food group items like apples and low-fat milks.

In 2023, we bought more than $6.4 billion of quality ingredients in the U.S. That includes 714 million pounds of beef, 133 million pounds of cheese, 2.6 billion pounds of potatoes and nearly 2 billion 100% cage-free eggs. Take our famous fries as just one example – our customers enjoy 3.6 billion servings per year in the U.S., which is more than 255 billion individual fries.

2. We listen to our customers

We’ve been obsessed with using real, quality ingredients since the day we opened our very first restaurant. And over the years, we’ve evolved our menu to keep pace with the latest customer preferences. Our menu provides clear and transparent nutrition information to help customers like you make informed choices about the menu items you know and love. And we know what’s not in your food is just as important as what’s in your food.

Our seven classic burgers—from our Big Mac® to the Quarter Pounder® with Cheese—contain no artificial preservatives or flavors, and no added colors from artificial sources (except the pickle).

Food additives such as, Red Dye No. 3, TBHQ, BHT/BHA, Titanium Dioxide and Azodicarbonamide are not on the menu.

3. We do right by our supplier partners and help their businesses grow

Over our 70-year history, we’ve carefully selected farmers and suppliers and built strong and long-term relationships based on a simple, shared mission: to serve safe, quality food every day.

It means we can set high standards together and that they can grow with us and create good jobs across the nation.

We have around 30 suppliers that make up 2/3 of our food and packaging.

Our relationships with suppliers create jobs and growth. In 2023 in Houston, we spent $104M with suppliers and supported 15,200 jobs. And in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, it was $85M and 9,800 jobs.

On any given day in 2023, more than 60,000 food safety audits were conducted at McDonald’s restaurants across the country.

“Our suppliers’ actions reverberate throughout the industry. Their commitment to quality, rigorous standards and ability to innovate impacts not just how the food we source is grown—it has the power to change entire industries.”

– Cesar Piña, Chief Supply Chain Officer, McDonald’s USA

4. We innovate together to strengthen America’s future food system.

From finding new ways to farm that protect the local environment and help strengthen small businesses, to growing potatoes that taste better and grow quicker, to working across the food industry to make cage-free eggs the norm: it’s our partnerships that make it all possible. And we’re excited to help make American food even better for the future.

We believe that for food to be delicious, it first has to be real and made with the highest quality ingredients. And when we do that in close partnership with the suppliers who make it possible, we can serve millions of customers every day while supporting thousands of good jobs and strengthening American food for the future.

“Our customers deserve real food with real ingredients – and that’s exactly what's on the menu at McDonald’s. Because when it comes to our food, we like to keep things simple – it’s all about great taste, great quality, and great value.” - Michael Gonda, SVP, Chief Impact Officer of North America for McDonald's",https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/logo/mcd_corp_social_feed_default.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 20:02:50.663738

As the global revenue of the sportswear company rose by 5.2 per cent to nearly US $ 17.5 billion, the company attributed the robust performance in the international space to the significant increase in online sales. The global sales grew substantially, rising to 20 per cent of total revenue from 17.4 per cent recorded in the previous year. Supported by large investments in important regions like India and Germany, this expansion is consistent with the company’s plan to increase its e-commerce footprint and establish itself as a worldwide sports brand.

Despite Decathlon partnering with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the company’s revenues did not see a significant surge in France. The home market of France’s revenue remained flat at around US $ 5.13 billion. Sales in physical stores of the home market were significantly affected, although the online sales saw a 5.78 per cent increase, now accounting for 17.5 per cent of the French business.

Decathlon’s net income has declined to around US $ 850 million in 2024, compared to previous 2023’s down from US $ 1,005 million in 2023.

2025 looks to be an incredibly tough year for the supermarket chain, with its stores closing across the country at warp speed.
Piggly Wiggly has to take the award for the grocery chain with the most charming name.","It's a hard time to be a grocery store. Over the last few years, grocery chains have had to battle a perfect storm of post-pandemic changes in customer behavior, rising prices from the cost of living crisis and the potential for tariffs, and advances in technology which have left physical stores more and more obsolete. This meant that 2024 saw the highest number of grocery stores closing since 2020, with folks turning to ordering groceries online to replace it. ""Not only do they want the best prices, but they also have no patience for stores that are constantly disorganized, out of stock, and that deliver poor customer service,"" says Deborah Weinswig, the CEO of Coresight Research, a firm which led analysis into current and future store closures across the U.S., via Business Wire.

Unfortunately, things are only going to get worse from here. Coresight Research also issued a grave prediction that 2025 is set to see even more closures, with as many as 15,000 stores closing its doors this year. Grocery stores are set to take a particular hit, and some of your favorites may be more in trouble than you think. Giants like Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons are set to close several stores in 2025, and others are following suit. Let's take a look at some of the major chains set to shut some of their doors.

On the surface, it seems like Walmart is untouchable. The world's largest company by revenue, it has approximately 4,600 stores across the United States of America, with thousands more across the world. However, even a business as mammoth as Walmart hasn't been immune to the economic shocks that have been ravaging retailers across the country, and as a result the normally affordable supermarket has had to raise its prices, with its eggs taking a particular hit.

This may well have left customers going elsewhere for their weekly grocery shopping, and certain stores in Walmart's line-up have suffered the consequences. The retail giant is closing a number of its stores in California throughout 2025, with others in Georgia and Ohio shutting up shop. It's also going through a reconfiguration on a higher level, with its North Carolina office closing, resulting in some job losses. This is part of a broader move by the retailer to bolster its main hubs in California and Arkansas, but it's still not the best look for the company.

If you're worried about Walmart going out of business any time soon, though, we wouldn't be. Over the next few years, Walmart is aiming to build or convert 150 additional stores, and remodel a large chunk of its existing locations. The retailer states that this will see more jobs being created, which is welcome news. Now if they could just do something about those Walmart groceries that are gonna see a price jump, we'd be fine.

There's a lot of change happening when you shop at Albertsons. The massive grocery chain announced in 2022 that it would be acquired by Kroger, which would have allowed both companies to team up and take on their gargantuan competitors like Walmart and Costco more capably. The deal, however, ended up making its way to the courts, where judges disputed the claim that companies like Walmart were direct competitors for Albertsons and Kroger, and flagged concerns that the joining of the two would lead to market domination in certain areas.

Advertisement

As a consequence, the merger was blocked — and Albertsons has had to shoulder the consequences. In an earnings call in January 2025, Albertsons' leaders stated that they would be looking to close some stores over the coming year as part of a streamlining effort. The company had reached the conclusion that its portfolio of stores was outsized in some areas, while also pointing out that it would be looking to open stores elsewhere. Albertsons didn't specify which stores would be closing (and it also pointed out that the closure process could extend to several years), but we wouldn't be too surprised if your local supermarket was a little worried.

Although Kroger has had a tough couple years, with its acquisition of Albertsons being scuppered before it got to the finish line and some food recalls it probably wants to forget, it's still managed to hold onto almost 2,800 stores across the country. Sadly, though, it's looking as though a few of those will be closing pretty soon — and those doors have already started shutting. In late January, Kroger announced the closure of its Belle Meade Plaza store in Nashville. It was one of several businesses that has been affected by redevelopment plans in the area, with retail and residential units planned to be built in its place.

Kroger will also see its Sterling Ridge location close in The Woodlands, Texas, with a planned final operation date of May 6. Although its other stores in the area will stay active, this particular Kroger location has suffered from a change in shopping habits in the immediate area. The way people buy their groceries has quite simply changed, and low foot traffic has rendered this store obsolete. The employees who currently work at the store will go through a reassignment process to hopefully work at other locations.

There's something cosy and vaguely nostalgic about Winn-Dixie, the Southeastern grocery chain that operates across five different states. Perhaps that partly comes from its local feel, and partly from the fact that it's never been a massive chain that has made it to other parts of the country. Unfortunately, that's also made it a threat for the bigger sharks in the supermarket ocean. In 2023, Winn-Dixie was acquired by Aldi, giving the German retailer the ability to make big moves across the Southeastern market and the potential to shut and convert stores at its will. Aldi also acquired Harvey's, another Southeastern favorite that may soon disappear from view completely.

Advertisement

It looks like it's pressing on with its plans pretty quickly. Reports of Winn-Dixie stores closing or being converted are springing up regularly in 2025. Two stores in Columbus and Phenix City have announced their closures in April and May, while others in Fort Lauderdale, Jackson, and Orlando have begun the conversion process into Aldis. In total, roughly 50 Winn-Dixie and Harvey's stores are due to be converted in the next 12 months or so. To be honest, we'd be surprised if any locations still existed at all by the end of the decade.

Someone needs to check on Safeway — we're not sure if it's alright. 2025 looks to be an incredibly tough year for the supermarket chain, with its stores closing across the country at warp speed. In February, Safeway had to shut its Webster Street store in San Francisco, citing customer safety concerns and persistent occurrences of theft. The city itself has been roundly criticized for not thinking of a plan that can cover this store's closure, which has left its residents without any full-service grocery stores in the immediate area. Given that Safeway took its pharmacy with it, many people have been left without easy access to medication.

Elsewhere, Safeway's fortunes aren't looking much better. The retailer is set to close its Rockville Pike, Maryland store in April, although this information was revealed by the employees of the store itself and not a press release. Another store in the Bay Area is due to shut in mid-April, with safety concerns again cited by Safeway as the reason, although it did also mention financial pressures as a driver for ceasing operations. Curiously, all of this has been done without any clear blow to Safeway's overall finances. In Q3 of 2024, it reported higher identical and digital sales, and for all intents and purposes appears to be a healthy company. Perhaps things are a bit more complicated than they appear, though.

Part of the appeal of Shaw's is that it's always been a big fish in a relatively small pond, which has given it a sense of familiarity. The retailer operates its 125 stores exclusively in the New England region, and while it may not have the footprint of Walmart, it has a local feel that's a bit more cosy. Unfortunately, that may not be lasting much longer. Shaw's recently announced that it was closing two of its stores in New England in 2025, and it could be the case that more are to follow.

Advertisement

The Shaw's store closures in Gloucester, Massachusetts and Concord, New Hampshire were announced in mid-March, with employees being relocated to nearby locations. ""Like all retailers, we're constantly evaluating the performance of our stores,"" the retailer said in a statement seen via Boston.com. ""Closing a location is always a tough decision, but we're focused on continuing to provide the products and services our customers value most."" The good news is that there are dozens of locations in both states that are still operating, but it's never a good sign when a supermarket seems to be shutting up shop.

You would think that with the unstoppable march of Amazon taking over all our lives, and the frankly wild amount of money the company makes, its brick-and-mortar grocery concept Amazon Fresh would be able to get an immediate foothold on the market. Well, interestingly, that hasn't quite been the case. In March 2025, the chain announced the closure of two of its stores California and Virginia, with the Virginia branch to close pretty much immediately and the California one to shut at the end of April.

Advertisement

The branches had only been in operation for a couple years before they had to close, which raised question marks about whether Amazon Fresh's pitch of ""frictionless"" technology, where you can just walk out without having to scan anything, was appealing to customers. People have already started dubbing them zombie stores, after all. However, Amazon was very keen to make the point that it was still committed to Amazon Fresh and figuring out exactly what works for customers. Perhaps it was just these few stores that didn't quite hit the mark, and we'd be surprised if it disappears completely any time soon. However, we could be seeing the beginnings of a rare misstep for Amazon.

Piggly Wiggly has to take the award for the grocery chain with the most charming name. However, even that can't save it from having to close its stores. 2025 will see several of its branches closing, and while its presence in the South is still pretty strong, it's made us question how long this iconic brand can last. It all started going awry in January, when the Piggly Wiggly in Lanett, Alabama announced that it was closing. The closure put an end to the long presence that Piggly Wiggly had in the community.

Advertisement

Things got even worse from there on in, with a beloved Piggly Wiggly in Columbia, South Carolina announcing that it was shutting its doors for the final time in March. Nicknamed ""The Social Pig,"" the store was a favorite of locals and university students alike, and was well-known as being a fixture in Columbia. ""Our lease has expired, and being unable to effectuate another that would continue the store as Piggly Wiggly, it is my sad duty to announce that our iconic Pig on Devine — the 'Social Pig' — is closing,"" said operator Darrell Miller in a post on Facebook. ""I submit our sincere thanks to the residents of the surrounding communities and the Greater Columbia area for your steadfast and generous support over the past fifty years. You have blessed us."" The post was flooded with comments in tribute to the store. These places matter, folks.

Dollar General may be a discount store, but it takes its income and profit margins very seriously. The chain, which sells discount groceries as well as a host of other goods, operates thousands of stores around the country, and it's not afraid to make bold moves when some of them aren't working. This was proven in a Q4 2024 investor call, in which Dollar General announced that it had conducted a ""store portfolio optimization review."" This is intense corporate talk for ""we checked how much money our stores were making, and some of them need to go.""

Advertisement

As a result, Dollar General told investors that it was to close 96 of its stores by the start of 2026. It also noted that it was going to convert six of its pOpshelf stores to Dollar General outlets in the same period, and close pOpshelf stores as well. This is a pretty dramatic move from the chain, and could see plenty of folks without a local Dollar General to buy cut-price goods from — which, at a time like this, isn't great news. The store didn't indicate which stores were going to be closed, but we should expect further announcements very soon.",https://www.thedailymeal.com/img/gallery/9-major-grocery-chains-closing-several-locations-in-2025/l-intro-1743527302.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 16:05:43.070972

This is the third time the health care conglomerate's bankruptcy strategy has failed in court.

Facing lawsuits from 60,000 claimants, the settlement would have ended the cases and prevented new ones in the future. In a news release, Johnson & Johnson called the claims ""meritless"" and based on ""junk science."" The company said it will return to the tort system to litigate the claims.

“Today’s decision highlights the broken tort system in the United States. The Company reiterates that none of the talc-related claims against it have merit and attempts to resolve this litigation were aimed at moving past this issue,” said Erik Haas, worldwide vice president of Litigation with Johnson & Johnson. “The decision to litigate every filed case is based on the simple fact that this is a fake claim created by greedy plaintiff lawyers looking for another deep pocket to sue and fueled by litigation-financed attorney advertising.”

Johnson & Johnson claims its products are safe, do not contain asbestos, and do not cause cancer. The company stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. in 2020, switching to a corn starch product.

The company had previously reached a $700 million settlement with dozens of states that had sued the company. The settlement allowed Johnson & Johnson to deny any wrongdoing.

ID3,Albertsons,2025-04-01 16:36:09+00:00,Grocery Dive,"Kroger's road ahead runs through its past, analysts say - Grocery Dive","Sam Silverstein, Jeff Wells, Catherine Douglas Moran",,,,,https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ceo-supermarkets-grocery-mcmullen-albertsons-walmart/744098/,"“The golden age of Kroger was before Rodney took over,” said Scott Mushkin, CEO of R5 Capital, referring to Kroger’s approach to the grocery industry under David Dillon, McMullen’s immediate predecessor as Kroger’s CEO.
The company faces lawsuits from Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire nearly 600 divested stores in connection with the deal.
Albertsons and C&S both allege that Kroger is responsible for the deal’s demise under pressure from regulators.
Albertsons and C&S are also demanding that Kroger pay them termination fees of $600 million and $125 million, respectively.
“We need that from a new leader: to be a little more specific about what the end game is.”","The last time Kroger brought on a new CEO was in January 2014. At that point, the company was riding high in the grocery industry: It was just about to close on its $2.5 billion acquisition of Harris Teeter, the tumult of the COVID-19 pandemic was still years away and Walmart had yet to assume the commanding role it now plays in the U.S. food retail sector.

A lot has changed over the past decade.

As Kroger looks for a successor to Rodney McMullen — who departed abruptly in early March after more than 11 years as the company’s chief executive — the grocer faces much less favorable circumstances that have industry experts wondering whether it can regain its former glory. Some of those conditions, like the enormous reach of competitors like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, are beyond its control, while other challenges are a direct result of decisions Kroger made when McMullen was in charge, according to analysts.

“The golden age of Kroger was before Rodney took over,” said Scott Mushkin, CEO of R5 Capital, referring to Kroger’s approach to the grocery industry under David Dillon, McMullen’s immediate predecessor as Kroger’s CEO. “If you just look at the business … I would say they’re kind of bumping along, kind of hanging on a little bit rather than thriving.”

Kroger’s challenges include recovering from its unsuccessful effort to merge with Albertsons — a transaction McMullen crafted and championed as CEO. The company faces lawsuits from Albertsons and C&S Wholesale Grocers, which had agreed to acquire nearly 600 divested stores in connection with the deal. Albertsons and C&S both allege that Kroger is responsible for the deal’s demise under pressure from regulators.

In its suit, filed in December, Albertsons claims that Kroger damaged the companies’ chances of winning approval for the merger because it was unwilling to develop more robust divestiture plans. Kroger responded with its own allegations, claiming that Albertsons worked secretly with C&S on a “misguided campaign” that led to the disintegration of the deal.

Albertsons and C&S are also demanding that Kroger pay them termination fees of $600 million and $125 million, respectively. Kroger has refused to do so, claiming that Albertsons and C&S forfeited the fees.

Under Dillon, Kroger focused heavily on basic operational details, like the length of checkout lines, customer service and store cleanliness, all of which helped the company maintain its position as a leader in the grocery space, Mushkin said. But more recently, Kroger has been less effective at communicating its value proposition to consumers than rivals like Sprouts Farmers Market and Publix, he added.

“It’s very difficult when you’re multi-banner, multi-regional, with different go-to-market strategies, to define what you are,” said Mushkin. “It's the challenge for whoever takes over Kroger: Why, as a consumer, should I shop you beyond location?”

A key issue for Kroger as it plots its future course is that its prices look more expensive to consumers than other retailers, a contrast that is exacerbated by Kroger’s dependence on promotions while Walmart has an everyday low-pricing model, said Karen Short, managing director and head of consumer and retail research for Melius Research.

“They’ve gotten themselves completely out of whack on pricing relative to their competitors,” Short said. “And I don’t know how you dig yourself out of all of that, because Walmart is increasingly giving you a reason to not go to Kroger.”

One way for Kroger to counter the perception that it charges more than Walmart for groceries would be to sacrifice its earnings for a while in order to invest in bringing down prices, Short said. However, that could prove to be a hard sell to investors given that the company’s operating profit and sales have been under pressure.

While Kroger’s stock price grew at a significantly faster clip than Walmart’s between 2013 and 2015, the trend reversed starting in 2016, with Walmart widening its lead during the past year, according to a research note Short and fellow Melius analyst Jacob Aiken-Phillips issued on March 14. On Tuesday, Short and Aiken-Phillips downgraded their rating of Kroger’s stock to “sell,” citing Walmart’s surging strength in grocery, Kroger’s leadership void and the legal actions brought by Albertsons and C&S as reasons investors should unload their shares.

Short also said Kroger’s search for a replacement for McMullen presents it with a unique opportunity to change course, adding that the company — which is currently under the leadership Ronald Sargent, who is serving as chairman and interim CEO — should look outside for a new leader.

“I think Kroger is rudderless, and they need somebody who is going to bring new blood and new life and new thought,” she said.

Speaking during an earnings call on March 6, Sargent said Kroger intends to consider candidates to replace McMullen from within its ranks and outside the company.

A new leader could likely help Kroger move past issues such as the failed combination with Albertsons and instead focus on reframing its relationship with consumers, said David Halliday, associate teaching professor of strategic management and public policy at the George Washington University School of Business.

“The time to do that is when a new CEO comes in. A new CEO can set a long-term plan, [while] an existing CEO is going to have a harder time making tough decisions like trading off profits for a viable long-term pricing strategy,” Halliday said. “The pricing strategy can't just be selling cheap food … but something that viably connects with customers and gives customers more value than they’re getting now.

Short said Kroger’s efforts in recent years to double down on its data operations and invest in the multibillion-dollar network of automated fulfillment centers it has developed with Ocado are also weighing Kroger down at a time when it needs to find ways to stand out.

Short added that Kroger’s efforts to invest in alternative profit businesses, which include its data analysis and third-party media operations, have distracted attention from weaknesses in its core grocery business. In addition, the Ocado project has cost much more than expected, she said.

As Kroger considers whom to hire to lead it going forward and how it should adjust its strategy, the company would do well to stay grounded in its roots as a supermarket operator, said Doug Munson, head of advisory services business development for retail intelligence provider RetailStat.

Although the pressure to compete head-to-head with major competitors is intense across areas like e-commerce, pricing and non-grocery revenue streams, Kroger should focus more on improving the quality and distinctive value of its core grocery business, Munson said.

Kroger is “not going to beat the Wiincos and the Walmarts on pricing, but the narrative should be, ‘When you come here, this is where you get your staples. This is your fundamental grocery store,’” Munson said.

More immediately, analysts will be looking for Kroger to clarify its vision about where it fits in the grocery landscape, said Michael Infranco, assistant vice president of Retailstat.

“We haven’t had the clearest strategies overall, the top-to-bottom strategy of what they want to be,” Infranco said. “We need that from a new leader: to be a little more specific about what the end game is.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Wp3yUqLaE8aqPwcxryVB1oqDI9JOamVLcgYr1V8GPFA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9IYXJyaXNfVGVldGVyLXN0b3JlX2V4dGVyaW9yLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-04-01 13:10:19.117291

Nike faces potential U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam, where it produces 50% of its footwear and 28% of its apparel. Higher tariffs could raise costs or force price hikes amid declining sales. Other brands like Adidas and Lululemon are also at risk. Vietnam is negotiating to minimize tariff impacts while maintaining trade ties with the U.S.

Nike could soon face another blow in its effort to revive its brand and reverse a long decline in sales: U.S. tariffs on imports from Vietnam.

On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce which countries and products he will target with a new round of tariffs aimed at encouraging domestic production and coaxing other nations to buy more U.S. goods.

Vietnam, which runs a $123.5 billion trade surplus with the United States, is a prime target.

Nike is one of several sportswear brands heavily reliant on Vietnam as a production site and higher tariffs would force the company to absorb higher costs or hike its prices at a time when it is already discounting some items to clear inventory.

Nike produced 50% of its footwear and 28% of its apparel in Vietnam in its 2024 financial year, according to its annual report. Rival Adidas is slightly less exposed, relying on Vietnam for 39% of its footwear and 18% of its apparel.

Live Events

The average U.S. tariff rate on footwear from Vietnam is 13.6%, while the rate on apparel is 18.8%, according to calculations based on January trade data made by Sheng Lu, professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.

""If tariffs are extended there, then Nike's got a problem,"" said Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Nike and Adidas are hardly alone. Vietnam has become a hub for high-tech running shoes, sportswear, and outdoor apparel as brands have sought to reduce exposure to China.

Lululemon, Columbia Sportswear and Amer Sports, which owns Salomon and Arc'Teryx, count Vietnam as their top manufacturing country.

But the potential tariffs come at a critical moment for Nike, which has lost market share of late to competitors viewed as fresher and more innovative, like On and Hoka. In a quarterly earnings call last month, Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said Nike's revenue was expected to continue to fall next quarter.

That outlook factored in current tariffs, said Mari Shor, senior equities analyst with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which holds Nike shares. ""But what if it gets worse?""

INDUSTRY BRACES FOR IMPACT

Some smaller, younger sportswear brands are even more exposed to Vietnam. Fast-growing running brand On in 2024 sourced 90% of its shoes and 60% of its apparel and accessories from the country.

On shoes are already expensive, selling for $130 to $330 a pair, and Samuel Wenger, the brand's chief operating officer, said tariffs were among the factors On considers when deciding on price. ""Our premium brand gives us the ability to adapt our pricing thoughtfully,"" he told Reuters.

Average U.S. prices of sneakers have already risen by 25% since 2019, partly because of rising production costs, said Beth Goldstein, footwear industry analyst at market research firm Circana. While U.S. sales of running shoes have risen 16% to $7.4 billion since 2021, according to Circana's Consumer Tracking Service, U.S. consumer confidence recently hit a four-year low, suggesting more price increases could prove hard to swallow.

Moving production out of Vietnam is no simple matter. Other Southeast Asian countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, could face tariffs too, and production costs are already rising there.

Factories in Cambodia are charging 5% to 10% more as they get more orders from retailers looking to shift production from China or Vietnam, said Michael Yee, CEO at apparel and accessories sourcing company MGF Sourcing in Hong Kong.

Nike, Adidas and Amer Sports declined to comment on questions about Vietnam tariffs. Lululemon and Columbia Sportswear did not reply to Reuters requests for comment. The good news, say experts, is that tariffs on imports from Vietnam - particularly for apparel - are unlikely to be as steep as those in China.

Leaders in Hanoi have taken several steps to stay in Trump's good graces, promising more imports from the U.S., lower duties, and allowing Starlink - the satellite company owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk - to offer its internet services in the country. The Trump Organization, meanwhile, is partnering with Vietnam on potential investments in hotel, real estate and golf course projects possibly worth billions of dollars.

""Vietnam has proven its ability to play the geopolitical game very skillfully,"" said T. Rowe Price portfolio manager Johannes Loefstrand, who runs a Frontier Markets Equity strategy weighted towards Vietnam stocks.

Wilbur Ross, who served as commerce secretary in Trump's first administration, said the president had generally good ties with Vietnam and had no reason to hit it hard with tariffs that would be felt on main street.

""People notice the cost of apparel because they buy it fairly frequently,"" Ross told Reuters.

Earnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions.

For the month of March, we highlight CFO takes on tariff preparation from Lululemon, Nike, Five Below, Volkswagen, Traeger, Costco, Macy’s and Target.

1. Lululemon

Market cap: $33.85 billion

Date of call: March 27

Lululemon CFO Meghan Frank was asked about the impact of tariffs on the company’s business during the retailer’s latest earnings call. The company only sources about 3% of its products from the U.S. but says tariffs minimally impact it. Frank said her team has the flexibility to tweak internal costs or prices should tariffs exceed the impact she forecasted they would have on the business.

“In terms of tariffs, we've got approximately 20 basis points of a headwind embedded in our guidance, which is reflective of current actions on China and Mexico imports,” Frank said. “We’re closely monitoring the environment. We'll continue to look across our cost structure, as well as to pricing, you know, should the environment change. So, [we’re] definitely keeping a close eye on that.”

2. Nike

Market cap: $94 billion

Date of call: March 20

In a tough call, Nike CFO Matthew Friend provided a candid take on company performance. For reasons that have been widely speculated on, the global retailer continues to struggle as competitors grow. The company’s leadership is pushing its “Win Now” strategy and taking steps to reduce reliance on revenues from sneakers into other product lines.

When it comes to tariffs, Friend wasn’t asked about their impact by analysts and only mentioned them in his opening remarks. He said they’ve already been factored into planning and current investor guidance.

“We have included the estimated impact from newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. We expect Q4 SG&A dollars to be up low to mid-single digits, including restructuring charges in the prior year,” Friend said. “We will continue to tightly manage expenses while we increase investment to fuel our Win Now priorities, most notably demand creation.”

“We are focused on what we can control. And for Nike at this moment, serving athletes with new product innovation and reigniting brand momentum is what matters most. Our collective experience, as well as the early signals we are seeing with consumers, gives us confidence in the path ahead,” he said.

3. Five Below

Market cap: $4.15 billion

Date of call: March 19

As a large importer of goods from China, Five Below and its CFO, Kristy Chipman, are navigating uncertainty due to tariffs. However, she identified the retailer’s 3% same-store sales growth as a potential offset to tariff-induced costs by Q1 2026, which could improve margins by spreading fixed costs over more revenue. If they achieve this, along with continued improvement in shrinkage, it could help absorb rising costs on Chinese goods, which account for 60% of their total inventory.

“As we get into next year, if the tariffs remain the same and we get through the first quarter, sure. At that 3% comp, which is still our leverage point, we should start to improve [in Q1 2026],” Chipman said. “[One of ]the areas really that we're looking for [is] positive shrink. We're seeing improvement in our shrink rate right now. If we see that again when we count in August, there should be some benefit that we can see that will create leverage both in the back half of this year and into 2026… So, certainly tariffs make it complex right now.”

4. Volkswagen

Market cap: $54.42 billion

Date of call: March 11

Volkswagen, which is facing a range of challenges to its business, had CFO Arno Antlitz avoid going into detail on tariffs and their impacts during the company’s most recent earnings call. While the auto industry is expected to be one of the hardest hit by potential tariffs, Antlitz said it is too early to comment.

“[For our] 2025 guidance, we don't really [want to] guide on the potential impact of tariffs, much too early to say,” said Antlitz. “It's also too early to expect what our competitors will react, whether tariffs will come at all. So, this is really too early.”

5. Traeger

Market cap: $216.88 million

Date of call: March 6

CFO Dominic Blosil gave his final earnings call for Traeger as he is set to leave the grill-maker after more than a decade with the company. As both he and CEO Jeremy Andrus noted, most of the company’s components and accessories are manufactured in the United States, so they are unaffected by tariffs from a supply chain and cost standpoint. Blosil said the company’s domestic sourcing strategy should give their leaders confidence in both the integrity of their balance sheet and forecasts moving forward.

“In Q1, we've been focused on bringing in as much inventory as possible ahead of anticipatory tariffs. The increase in inventory at the end of the year is tied more to the Woodridge launch and the fact that there's continued load-in taking place ahead of peak season, which is just [our] normal seasonal inventory moves within this business as [we] think about launching new innovation, Blosil said. “I think the overarching theme here is inventory levels on our balance sheet and channel continue to be well balanced, and we feel confident in those levels.”

6. Costco

Market cap: $423.03 billion

Date of call: March 6

Costco CFO Gary Millerchip told analysts the company’s supply chain costs were slightly up due to their broader strategy on inventory and supply chain management in light of potential tariffs. The company’s strong margins also factored into this strategy. Millerchip noted that Costco’s core margin improved slightly despite rising supply chain costs. As a result, leadership is implementing a strategy of keeping inventory high to maintain competitive pricing.

“One of the things that was an increased cost during the quarter was higher supply chain costs as we have been continuing to buy more inventory, which we think will be helpful as you think about some of the unpredictability that we've seen in supply chain timing and also with the potential risk around tariffs,” Millerchip said. “And really, when we looked at the overall results for the quarter and saw that the core margin overall was going to be up slightly, we have that ability to be able to invest and ensure that we're continuing to take care of the members. So, we were quite deliberate on that this quarter.”

7. Macy’s

Market cap: $3.56 billion

Date of call: March 6

As the legacy retailer moves past accounting issues and widespread store closures, Macy’s CFO Adrian Mitchell — who will be replaced by Capri Holdings’ Thomas J. Edwards in June — spoke about inflationary pressures driven by tariffs. While CEO Tony Spring told analysts there are no pending impacts from tariffs yet, Mitchell said they are reinforcing the company’s focus on controlling internal variables.

“You know, there's a lot of changes that we're seeing day to day happening with tariffs,” said Mitchell. “We recognize the inflationary pressure. And obviously, there were some unexpected factors in the early part of the quarter with the fires and cold weather that impacted results for the business. But for the first quarter, you know, we expect that pressure to continue, and we're really focused on what we can control. The good news is that the investments that we're making in the customer experience are working, and what we're doing now is scaling those initiatives to a larger portion of our business.”

8. Target

Market cap: $47.79 billion

Date of call: March 4

Target CFO Jim Lee said he is taking a multifaceted approach to navigating tariff uncertainty. While he acknowledged the company’s historical experience sourcing at scale in volatile markets, he is also maintaining a “larger than normal” balance sheet to manage risk. Additionally, Target will no longer offer quarterly guidance to allow more flexibility if tariff-related changes arise.

""We plan to make some extra flexibility in the near term to help us navigate uncertainty regarding tariffs,” said Lee. “With a sourcing organization that's decades old, our team has a lot of experience in navigating this type of volatility. They're monitoring the situation carefully, and we expect to successfully navigate through any changes, just like we have in the past.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/hq0XQ-H016hJznJlxigg981WaD09BBHTJLcQARzSuRk/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy01NDcxNjc0NTBfMi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-04-01 16:05:48.209358

They were the last achieved under outgoing CEO Martin and, in an unusual move, they were released internationally before being published in France.

The fact that recorded the same revenue in France in 2024 as in 2023, €4.73 billion, might have something to do with this time lag. Especially since, as a partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Decathlon benefited from huge media exposure last year in France, and invested heavily to be visible before and during the summer. However, selling approximately 1.8 million licensed products wasn’t enough to offset the twin impact of rising inflation and the gloomy consumption outlook in France.

Decathlon’s physical stores were the most affected, since the retailer has reported a 5.78% growth in online sales, which now account for 17.5% of its business in France. These figures are sure to raise the alarm with union representatives in the country, where Decathlon is part of a retail sector that is highly concerned about shrinking store fleets.

The Decathlon group, which has over 23,000 employees in France, seems to be aware of this element, and highlighted the fact that in 2024 it increased its store fleet by three, and now operates 320 stores across its various retail concepts, having invested €160 million in upgrading its stores.

International growth

However, stagnating sales in France, Decathlon’s main market, went hand in hand with a significant increase in the group's business outside France. At constant exchange rates, Decathlon's overall revenue increased by 5.2% to €16.2 billion. The previous year, growth was 4.4%, but the 2024 fiscal year included the Olympic Games and the men’s European Football Championship, two events which are usually major growth drivers for the industry. And at constant exchange rates, revenue growth stood at 3.8%.","https://media.fashionnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,width=600,height=600,format=auto/m/2dce/2db5/bb16/f0ee/a3b2/d463/efec/35b4/796d/0666/0666.jpg",N,,2025-04-01 23:01:21.829191

Howard Schultz and Starbucks stick together like glue, but his journey with the company has been far from a straight line. Schultz has stepped away and returned to the company three times over the years aiming to reshape Starbucks into a global powerhouse. His leadership, vision, and strategic decisions have defined not just Starbucks but also modern coffee culture.

The First Build: Creating the Starbucks Brand

In 1981, Howard Schultz visited a small coffee shop in Seattle called Starbucks, which at the time sold coffee beans rather than the brewed drink we know for today. Schultz was inspired by the coffee culture observed in Italy, visioning Starbucks as a ""third place"" between work and home where people could gather and enjoy high-quality espresso beverages.

After joining Starbucks as Director of Retail Operations and Marketing in 1982, Schultz left in 1985 to start his own coffee company, Il Giornale, which mirrored the Italian espresso bar experience. Two years later, he acquired Starbucks, merged it with Il Giornale, and began expanding aggressively. Under his leadership, Starbucks introduced handcrafted espresso beverages, pioneered customer-centric service, and launched an iconic brand experience. By the late 1990s, Starbucks had expanded across the U.S. and entered international markets, becoming a household name.

The Second Build: Rescuing Starbucks from Decline

In 2000, Schultz stepped down as CEO, transitioning to Chairman, and Starbucks continued expanding. However, by the mid-2000s, rapid growth had led to a decline in quality, loss of brand identity, and financial struggles. Competitors like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts had entered the premium coffee space, and customer experience was deteriorating.

In 2008, Schultz returned as CEO to fix the struggling company. His first move was to refocus on quality and authenticity. He closed 7,100 stores for a day of barista retraining, removed inefficient automatic espresso machines, and revamped the company’s digital presence. Schultz also introduced the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program, mobile ordering, and a renewed emphasis on social responsibility. His turnaround efforts revitalized Starbucks, and by the early 2010s, the company was once again thriving.

What's your go to Starbucks order?

The Third Build: A New Era and the Future of Starbucks

Schultz successfully revived Starbucks but decided to step down once again in 2017, handing the role to Kevin Johnson. If we couldn't see how much Schultz couldn't let go of the business, in 2022 he returned amid Starbucks' wave of challenges, including unionization efforts, economic shifts, and post-pandemic consumer changes.

His third tenure focused on addressing employee concerns, navigating the labor movement within Starbucks, and reinforcing the company’s commitment to ethical sourcing and sustainability. He also accelerated Starbucks' expansion into digital and drive-thru services, positioning the company for the future.

Conclusion

Howard Schultz’s repeated returns to Starbucks showcase his ability to lead, adapt, and innovate in an ever-changing market. His vision for Starbucks as more than just a coffee chain but a cultural and community-driven brand has been the foundation of its success. Though he has stepped away again, his influence continues to shape the company, proving that great leadership isn’t about building a company just once, but knowing when and how to rebuild it.",https://www.ceotodaymagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ceo.png,N,,2025-04-01 10:01:46.075111

Fourth Quarter Highlights

Recognized a net loss on revaluation of carbon credit streaming and royalty agreements of $13.2 million (net loss on revaluation of $24.0 million in Q4 2023). The net loss on revaluation for each period was driven by reductions in the carbon credit production and sales profiles and carbon credit pricing assumptions, and an increase to the risk-adjusted discount rate.

Generated $0.5 million in settlements from carbon credit streaming and royalty agreements (settlements of $nil in Q4 2023).

Operating loss of $14.9 million (operating loss of $26.8 million in Q4 2023).

Recognized net loss of $16.9 million (net loss of $26.1 million in Q4 2023).

Adjusted net loss was $0.9 million (adjusted net loss of $2.2 million in Q4 2023) (see the ""Non-IFRS Accounting Standards Measures” section of this news release).

Paid $2.2 million in upfront deposits for carbon credit streaming and royalty agreements (paid $2.1 million in upfront deposits in Q4 2023).

Portfolio Updates

Rimba Raya Stream: On April 26, 2024, the Company announced that it was informed that PT Rimba Raya Conservation (""PT Rimba”), the local concession holder for the Rimba Raya project, had its Forest Utilization Business License (the ""Concession License”) revoked by the Indonesian Government’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the ""MOEF”). PT Rimba challenged the MOEF’s revocation of the Concession License, and in July 2024, the State Administrative Court of Jakarta (the ""Court of Jakarta”) reached a decision on PT Rimba’s claim and declared that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void. The MOEF appealed the decision of the Court of Jakarta and in September 2024, the State Administrative High Court of Jakarta (the ""High Court of Jakarta”) upheld the Court of Jakarta’s decision declaring that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void. The MOEF submitted an appeal of the decision of the High Court of Jakarta and as such, the decision of the High Court of Jakarta upholding that the revocation by the MOEF of the Concession License is void does not yet have permanent legal force. While the appeal process is underway, the interlocutory decision issued by the Court of Jakarta on May 16, 2024, requiring the MOEF to suspend the implementation of its decree in respect of the revocation of the Concession License, will remain in place.

In October 2024, InfiniteEARTH Limited and its Indonesian subsidiary PT InfiniteEARTH Nusantara, the project operators of the Rimba Raya project (collectively ""InfiniteEARTH”) delivered a notice of intent to abandon the project (the ""RR Notice of Abandonment”). Pursuant to the RR Notice of Abandonment, InfiniteEARTH claims that a Regulation entitled Regulation of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry Number 7 Year of 2023 issued on June 14, 2023 by the Indonesian Government (""Regulation No. 7 2023”), prohibits the issuance and transfer of carbon rights from PT Rimba to InfiniteEARTH. InfiniteEARTH claims that as a result of Regulation No. 7 2023, it has been unable to economically develop or continue to operate the Rimba Raya project and that this is a force majeure event under the Rimba Raya Stream. The Company has notified InfiniteEARTH that it rejects the assertion that Regulation No. 7 2023 is an event of force majeure and has commenced an arbitration seeking, among other things, an order that the RR Notice of Abandonment is invalid or void.

In October 2024, the Company commenced an arbitration administered by the International Centre of Dispute Resolution against InfiniteEARTH in accordance with the Rimba Raya Stream; and against the shareholders of InfiniteEARTH Limited in accordance with the Strategic Alliance Agreement (the ""SAA""). The arbitration has since been bifurcated into two arbitration proceedings, dealing with (i) the Rimba Raya Stream; and (ii) the SAA.

In October 2024, the Company also issued a Notice of Action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice seeking declaratory relief against the principals of InfiniteEARTH Limited and their related entities, seeking to enforce its rights in relation to guarantees and non-competition agreements related to the Rimba Raya Stream and the SAA. Some of the defendants have counterclaimed. The dispute between the Company and InfiniteEARTH arises out of acts and omissions that the Company alleges are improper and in breach of the Rimba Raya Stream, the SAA and related agreements. Management of the Company believes that delivering the Notice of Arbitration and issuing the Notice of Action in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice were important steps in preserving the Company’s legal and contractual rights.

As a result of the uncertainty of the duration and outcome of the appeal process in respect of the Concession License and the ongoing legal dispute between the Company, InfiniteEARTH and the founders of InfiniteEARTH, the Company has reclassified the status of the Rimba Raya Stream to ""Expired"". As at December 31, 2024, the Company has determined the fair value of the Rimba Raya Stream to be $nil.

Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream: In the third quarter of 2024, Fundación MarVivo Mexico, A.C. and MarVivo Corporation (collectively, ""MarVivo”) delivered a notice of intent to abandon the project (the ""MarVivo Notice of Abandonment”). Pursuant to the MarVivo Notice of Abandonment, MarVivo claims that the failure to transfer the concession rights from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (""SEMARNAT”), Mexico’s environment ministry, to the jurisdiction of Mexico’s National Commission for Protected Natural Areas (""CONANP”), constitutes an event of force majeure and that it is no longer economical to develop or continue to operate the project. The Company’s position is that the attempt to abandon the project constitutes a breach of the terms of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream. The Company has notified MarVivo that it rejects the assertion that the failure to transfer the concession rights constitutes an event of force majeure and that if MarVivo abandons the project or takes steps to wind-down, this will amount to a breach of the terms of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream. As a result of the MarVivo Notice of Abandonment and the assertions of MarVivo, the Company has determined the fair value of the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream to be $nil as at December 31, 2024. The Company reserves all rights with respect to the agreements between the parties and intends to strictly enforce its legal and contractual rights under the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream.

Sustainable Community Stream: In the third quarter of 2024, the Company exercised its contractual rights to terminate the Sustainable Community Stream as a result of, among other things, the failure of the project operator, Will Solutions Inc., to meet its milestone related to the registration of its Ontario project and its failure to develop and implement the project in accordance with the project plan (including continued delays in project development activities and lower-than-expected project enrollments). As a result of the Sustainable Community Stream being terminated, the fair value of the Sustainable Community Stream was determined to be $nil as at December 31, 2024. The Company intends to strictly enforce its legal and contractual rights under the Sustainable Community Stream.

Cerrado Biome Stream: At the time of project registration, the project planned to expand the project to 80,000 hectares by incorporating more land parcels, and to generate approximately 13 million carbon credits over a 30-year project life. Enrollment of additional land parcels has been slower than anticipated, primarily due to declining demand and lower pricing for REDD+ carbon credits. As a result, the expected revenue from carbon credit sales has decreased, reducing the financial incentive for landholders to transition from agricultural production to REDD+ project enrollment. Currently, the project consists of two land parcels covering approximately 11,000 hectares, expected to generate 1.2 million carbon credits over 30 years; however, the actual number of carbon credits issued will depend on the project’s ability to attract additional landholders. Revenue shortfalls have been driven by delays in the Verra verification process and price volatility for credits issued by REDD+ projects.

Waverly Biochar Stream and Royalty: Following the accelerated payment of the final milestone payments in the second quarter of 2024, the project reached mechanical completion and first biochar production in the third quarter of 2024. However, additional technical challenges prevented continuous operation of the facility and have continued to delay full production capacity. The project is currently focused on securing additional funding to support commissioning, the initial facility audit, and the first output audit with Puro.earth. Verification was anticipated in the third quarter of 2025, with first issuance of carbon credits to follow immediately thereafter, but is now expected to be delayed.

In 2023, the Company announced an agreement to provide Microsoft Corporation with carbon credits from the Waverly Biochar Stream of up to 10,000 carbon credits per year. Under this agreement, the Company is committed to delivering a minimum quantity of credits on specified future dates. If the Company is unable to fulfill this commitment, Microsoft Corporation may request that credits be sourced from an alternative project of their choosing.

Community Carbon Stream: In 2024, the projects under the Community Carbon Stream issued over 1,600,000 carbon credits from the Mozambique cookstove project, the Uganda cookstove project, the Tanzania cookstove project, and the Uganda household safe water project. Additionally, the Community Carbon Stream generated $1.1 million in cash settlements for the year ended December 31, 2024.

On May 8, 2024, the Company amended the terms of the Community Carbon Stream resulting in, among other things, revising the Company's economic interest to provide for a tiered streaming structure which is adjusted as certain return on invested capital thresholds are achieved, and adjusting the portfolio composition and milestone payments to focus on the five strongest projects, three cookstove projects in Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda and two water purification projects in Malawi and Uganda.

Following the May 2024 amendment, the Company anticipates that the project's actual emission reductions will be materially lower than previously expected due to methodological changes and declining prices, which have reduced forecasted creditable unit deployments. Concerns over emissions reduction overestimation, additionality, and verification challenges have raised questions about cookstove credit quality, prompting methodological revisions as the market adapts to evolving buyer expectations. While these changes aim to enhance credibility, they have also reduced demand and driven down prices.

Nalgonda Rice Farming Stream: In December 2024, the Company delivered a notice to Core CarbonX Pte. Ltd. and its services provider, Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited that an event of default occurred and is continuing due to the failure of the project to reach development completion prior to June 30, 2024. While no further action has been taken at this time, the Company reserves all rights under its agreements.

The project was registered with Verra on February 10, 2025, using the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism Methodology AMS-III.AU: Methane emission reduction by adjusted water management practice in rice cultivation in the VCS program (""AMS-III.AU”). Registration and first validation of the project was delayed when Verra temporarily inactivated AMS-III.AU as part of a broader review of validation and verification quality and began developing a revised rice-specific methodology to replace AMS-III.AU. During this review, Verra determined that certain projects identified as having quality issues with validations and/or verifications would remain on hold, but Core CarbonX’s projects, including the Nalgonda Rice Farming project, were approved for registration under AMS-III.AU.

Verra released the new VCS Methodology VM0051 (Improved Management in Rice Production Systems v1.0) on February 27, 2025, which the project plans to transition to for the second monitoring period. However, the project has already applied the guidelines required under the VCS Methodology VM0051. At this time, it is not known how the transition to the new methodology will impact the project, if at all.

As of December 31, 2024, approximately 32,000 landholders were enrolled in the project, covering 36,548 hectares of farmland. Enrollment remains ongoing, with a target of expanding to approximately 62,000 hectares. However, progress has been slower than expected due to registration delays, which have also postponed farmer compensation and, in turn, affected enrollment. The project was registered with Verra on February 10, 2025.

Enfield Biochar Stream: In April 2024, Standard Biocarbon Corporation (""Standard Biocarbon”) achieved its first biochar production. However, technical challenges have delayed the commissioning process. Standard Biocarbon is working with PYREG GmbH, the engineer and builder of the PYREG Machines, to resolve these issues as it scales toward full operating capacity. The project continues to collect operational data required for a facility audit and official registration with the Puro.earth carbon credit standard. Currently, the project is on care and maintenance while seeking additional funding to support commissioning, the initial facility audit, and the first output audit.

Azuero Reforestation Stream: On May 21, 2024, the Company, Microsoft Corporation and Rubicon Carbon Capital LLC (""Rubicon”) entered into a carbon credit streaming agreement, as amended on November 23, 2024 (the ""Azuero Reforestation Stream”) with Azuero Reforestation Colectiva, S.A. (""ARC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ponterra Ltd. (""Ponterra”), for a reforestation project located on Azuero Province, Los Santos Province, Republic of Panama. Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, ARC will deliver 13.5% of the carbon credits created by the project to the Company. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation has entered into an offtake agreement to purchase 100% of the Company’s carbon credits delivered under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream through to 2040. Carbon Streaming will also act as the sole marketer of ARC’s carbon credits not already committed to the co-investors under the Azuero Reforestation Stream.

Under the terms of the Azuero Reforestation Stream, Carbon Streaming, alongside Rubicon and Microsoft Corporation, will fund 100% of project costs over seven years. The Company agreed to make an upfront deposit of up to $7.1 million with $0.3 million paid on closing, and additional milestone payments made as the project achieves planting and sapling survival milestones, and will receive 13.5% of total credits, which is expected to be approximately 438,000 carbon credits through 2052.

Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream: In January 2025, the Company received a Notice of Adverse Impact from Mast Reforestation SPV I, LLC (""Mast”) and the parent company of Mast, Droneseed Co. d/b/a Mast Reforestation under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream pursuant to which, among other things, Mast advised the Company that the Sheep Creek project has experienced significantly higher than expected mortality rates and that the surviving seedlings had exhibited slower than expected growth rates. As a result, Mast indicated to the Company that it no longer expects to deliver the Company the agreed-upon 286,229 carbon removal credits, referred to as forecast mitigation units (""FMUs”) under the Climate Action Reserve’s Climate Forward program under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream, as Mast no longer considers the existing Sheep Creek project plan and budget to be viable. The Company has formally responded to the Notice of Adverse Impact and requested that Mast respond to the Company’s significant concerns regarding, among other things, the timing of the delivery of the Notice of Adverse Impact, and the characterization of the cause of the adverse impact. The Company is continuing to evaluate all legal avenues available under the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream. As a result, the Company no longer anticipates generating cash flow from the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream and has determined its fair value to be $nil as of December 31, 2024.

Feather River Reforestation Stream: In 2024, carbon credit market demand has generally shifted towards lower risk carbon credits. FMUs, which are designed to facilitate forward financing, inherently carry higher risk, leading to supply that has exceeded demand. FMU issuance is expected in 2025. However, given the uncertainties surrounding FMU sales, the Company has determined the fair value of the Feather River Reforestation Stream to be $nil as of December 31, 2024.

Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream: In March 2025, Mast delivered the Company a notice of termination of the Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream and the Baccala Ranch project, thereby confirming it will forego any plantings. The Company had not advanced any funds for the Baccala project and the closing of the Baccala Ranch Reforestation Stream remained subject to customary closing conditions.

Amazon Portfolio Royalty: Following a corporate reorganization, Future Carbon assigned its interests in the Yellow Ipe, ABC Norte and Gairova projects (collectively the ""Ecologica Portfolio”) to Ecological Assessoria Ltda. and its affiliates (collectively ""Ecologica”), and retained the Rio Madeira Project, (the ""Future Carbon Portfolio”). To reflect this restructuring, the Original Amazon Royalty was replaced on April 17, 2024, by two new royalty agreements: one between the Company and Future Carbon for the Future Carbon Portfolio (the ""FC Amazon Royalty”), and another between the Company and Ecologica on the Ecologica Portfolio (the ""Ecologica Amazon Royalty”). Each agreement carried a purchase price of $1.5 million, maintaining the original $3.0 million investment. No additional funds were advanced by the Company as part of Future Carbon’s reorganization.

Bonobo Peace Forest Royalty: The royalty agreement was originally intended to convert into a stream agreement upon successful validation and verification of the project. However, due to political instability in the DRC, weakened market sentiment for REDD+ projects, and a significant decline in demand for REDD+ carbon credits, Carbon Streaming decided to halt further investment. The Company currently has no plans to proceed with a stream agreement.

The project has been seeking additional investment to support a renewed technical effort for registration under the new Verra VM0048 methodology. Given the material uncertainty surrounding fundraising for REDD+ project development, the early-stage nature of the project’s technical development, and persistent weakness in demand for REDD+ carbon credits, the Company has determined the fair value of the Bonobo Peace Forest Royalty to be $nil as at December 31, 2024.

Strategy

Carbon Streaming is currently focused on maximizing value from the existing portfolio of investments and pursuing all options to achieve that goal. During 2024, the Company has undergone changes to the Board and management, including the termination of certain consulting contracts, which reduced ongoing cash expenditure and streamlined decision-making. The Company continues to focus on its previously announced evaluation of strategic alternatives with a focus on maximizing value for all shareholders. These alternatives could include acquisitions, divestments, corporate transactions, financings, other strategic partnership opportunities or continuing to operate as a public company.

The Company’s carbon credit streaming agreements are structured to retain a portion of the cash flows from carbon credit sales, with stream-specific retention varying. Project partners typically receive the balance through ongoing delivery payments under the terms of each agreement. Cash flows are subject to fluctuations based on realized carbon credit prices and agreement terms. As the Company continues to evaluate its strategic direction, it remains focused on optimizing portfolio economics and managing exposure to market volatility.

Outlook

Carbon Streaming continues to reposition itself for success and for maximizing shareholder value amid ongoing challenges. In May 2024, as part of its ongoing corporate restructuring first initiated in 2023, the Company announced changes to its senior management and Board after constructive discussions with certain shareholders. The Company continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for the business and remains focused on cash flow optimization through the reduction of operating expenses and a reassessment of its existing streams and royalties. Building on the previous measures implemented by the Company to reduce ongoing operating expenses, further steps have been taken in recent months, including significantly reducing employee headcount, renegotiating and amending vendor agreements to lower costs, eliminating cash-settled director’s fees to the Board and terminating certain consulting contracts. As the Company’s broader strategy continues to evolve, these recent steps are expected to result in significant reductions to annualized ongoing operating expenses when compared to 2024.

While the Company aims to increase cash flow generation through the sale of carbon credits from several streaming agreements over the next year, there remains ongoing uncertainty regarding the evolving nature of carbon markets, including potential registry delays, project-specific issues, and methodology-related risks, in addition to impacts the industry may face as a result of general economic, political and regulatory conditions. In 2024, the Company has recognized a decrease in the fair values of the Rimba Raya Stream, the Magdalena Bay Blue Carbon Stream, the Sustainable Community Stream, and the Sheep Creek Reforestation Stream to $nil as a result of the failure of the respective projects to meet their obligations under the stream agreements and ongoing legal disputes. The Company is actively pursuing all available legal remedies to protect its investments and enforce its contractual rights. Given the multiple ongoing litigation matters, the outcomes remain uncertain and could materially impact the Company’s financial position and strategic direction. Please refer to the ""Legal Proceedings” section of the Company’s most recently filed MD&A for further information.

Given the evolving nature of carbon markets and ongoing legal considerations, Carbon Streaming is focussed on maximizing value from the existing portfolio of investments and pursuing all options to achieve that goal.

For a comprehensive discussion of the risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could impact the Company’s strategy and outlook, including without limitation, changes in demand for carbon credits and Indonesian developments described herein, investors are urged to review the section of the Company’s most recently filed AIF entitled ""Risk Factors” a copy of which is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.

Non-IFRS Accounting Standards Measures

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Loss Per Share

The term ""adjusted net loss” in this news release is not a standardized financial measure under the IFRS Accounting Standards and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used. These non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance, cash flows and financial position as prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards. Management believes that these non-IFRS Accounting Standards measures, together with performance measures and measures prepared in accordance with the IFRS Accounting Standards, provide useful information to investors and shareholders in assessing the Company’s liquidity and overall performance.

Adjusted net loss is calculated as net and comprehensive loss and adjusted for the revaluation of carbon credit streaming and royalty agreements, the revaluation of warrant liabilities, the impairment loss on early deposit interest receivable, the revaluation of derivative liabilities, the revaluation of the convertible note, the impairment loss on investment in associate, the gain on dissolution of associate, and the corporate restructuring which the Company views as having a significant non-cash or non-continuing impact on the Company’s net and comprehensive loss calculation and per share amounts. Adjusted net loss is used by the Company to monitor its results from operations for the period.

ID1,AB InBev,2025-04-01 07:15:46+00:00,Jersey Evening Post,Travis Perkins says construction recovery 'uncertain' as sales slide - Jersey Evening Post,Newsdesk,,,,,https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/uknews/2025/04/01/travis-perkins-says-construction-recovery-uncertain-as-sales-slide/,"Travis Perkins has revealed a slump in sales as weaker pricing and waning demand impacted its builders’ merchants business.
The London-listed company also revealed that profits slumped by almost a quarter during a “challenging” year due to continued weakness in the UK construction market.
Travis Perkins said the pace and rate of a recovery in the construction market is still “uncertain and will likely need further cuts to interest rates and an uplift to consumer confidence levels to stimulate a meaningful increase in demand”.
This was particularly driven by a 6.2% fall in revenues from its merchanting arm, linked to “depressed levels of UK construction activity”.
Geoff Drabble, chair of Travis Perkins, said: “Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the strength and timing of a recovery in UK construction activity, with more resources re-deployed into customer-facing roles, the group is now better placed to benefit from returning demand.","Travis Perkins has revealed a slump in sales as weaker pricing and waning demand impacted its builders’ merchants business.

Travis Perkins said the pace and rate of a recovery in the construction market is still “uncertain and will likely need further cuts to interest rates and an uplift to consumer confidence levels to stimulate a meaningful increase in demand”.

It said pricing has stabilised in the merchanting operation but that sales volumes have continued to decline into the new financial year.

However, it pointed towards growth in its Toolstation business, which was buoyed by new stores.

It came as the group reported that revenues for the firm fell 4.7% to £4.61 billion in 2024 after it was impacted by price deflation and weaker trading volumes.

This was particularly driven by a 6.2% fall in revenues from its merchanting arm, linked to “depressed levels of UK construction activity”.

Meanwhile, its Toolstation business saw revenues improve by 2.5% for the year after it opened 17 new stores.

The group saw adjusted operating profits fall by 23.2% to £152 million for the year.

The company is currently searching for a new chief executive after it announced last month that Pete Redfern would leave due to ill health, six months into the role.

Geoff Drabble, chair of Travis Perkins, said: “Whilst uncertainty remains regarding the strength and timing of a recovery in UK construction activity, with more resources re-deployed into customer-facing roles, the group is now better placed to benefit from returning demand.

“This will be supported by disciplined capital allocation, focused on upgrading and protecting our core competitive advantages, and a clear customer-focused strategy owned by the leaders of the business.

“I am confident that this approach will provide attractive returns for shareholders over the medium-term.”",https://i0.wp.com/jerseyeveningpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2.34751942-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1440&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-01 03:59:31.788940

Calvin Klein's Penthouse Office and Studio in Chelsea to Hit the Market

Now the chief executive officer is looking for Bad Bunny to help take the company higher as it navigates an especially tricky regulatory and consumer environment.

Larsson has been on a multiyear journey to remake the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent with his PVH+ strategic plan. That plan touches every part of the company, but can be seen clearly in Calvin Klein’s latest tie-up with rapper, singer and record producer Bad Bunny.

“What you see now from us in Calvin Klein with the Bad Bunny campaign is really exciting,” Larsson said in an interview. “We lean into the strongest category in Calvin Klein — Calvin Klein men’s underwear. We put an enormous amount of innovation into the existing hero product.”

That includes the introduction of the company’s new Icon Cotton Stretch, updates to the fit and the “infinity waistband” that has no stitching.

“We continued that in a cut-through campaign with Bad Bunny, one of the most-streamed artists on Spotify,” Larsson said. “That creates cultural connection. You have us leaning into the category strongly, reinventing a hero product, connecting it to a breakthrough campaign.”

The CEO called the collective impact of that “massive.”

When the campaign launched on Calvin Klein’s Instagram this month, it reached more than 29 million users in the first 48 hours and added nearly 100,000 followers in the first week.

That echoed Jeremy Allen White’s attention-grabbing turn in his Calvins last year.

Tommy Hilfiger has also been busy, recently launching The Hilfiger Resort, a summer event on the Caribbean island of Canouan with Patrick Schwarzenegger, Madelyn Cline and Abby Champion. The launch garnered 160 million impressions in just 72 hours.

“We really tapped both brands into the zeitgeist,” Larsson said.

PVH is living in the moment, but that doesn’t mean the moment is necessarily easy.

“We had a strong [fourth quarter], strong holiday, in February we saw it slow down, especially in North America,” the CEO said. “And then it stabilized in March and came back a little bit.”

Easter will be telling.

For PVH, fourth-quarter net income fell 42.2 percent to $157.2 million, or $2.83 a diluted share, from $241.8 million, or $4.55, a year earlier.

But analysts were looking at adjusted earnings per share, which came in at $3.27 — 6 cents ahead of the $3.21 analysts forecast.

Revenues for the quarter ended Feb. 2 fell 5 percent to $2.4 billion — a 2 percent drop in constant currencies. The result included a 3 percent decline attributed to an extra week in the year-ago quarter.

That put the top line above the $2.3 billion analysts were expecting.

The global Calvin Klein business rose 1 percent in constant currencies while Tommy Hilfiger decreased by 3 percent in the quarter.

“It’s definitely a tough moment for retail in general,” Larsson said. “I believe it’s a really good moment for us, having two of the most iconic and beloved brands and step-by-step, month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter building more relevance into those brands. It puts us on a trajectory to where we set out to go.

“We are focusing on what’s within our control,” he said.

Larsson said the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed so far would not have a big impact of PVH’s business and are planned for in the company’s guidance.

For this year, PVH projected that adjusted profits per share would rise to $12.40 to $12.75, from $11.74 last year. That’s well ahead of the $11.56 analysts projected.

Revenues are projected to be flat to slightly up for 2025.

The company also plans to give something back to shareholders through an additional $500 million in share repurchases this year.

One big question mark is the company’s back and forth with the Chinese government, a topic the CEO plans to address on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday.

China’s Ministry of Commerce made a preliminary determination in January that PVH engaged in improper practices related to the Xinjiang region, although the impact of that ruling is still not clear.

In 2021, PVH stopped working with factories that used cotton from Xinjiang, where more than a million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims are alleged to be under internment, with some forced to work.

""We remain highly focused on execution of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, which we believe has the potential to deliver landmark results that can establish AVIM therapy as a new standard of care for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension in patients already indicated for a pacemaker. We also believe it can lay the foundation for expanding use of AVIM-enabled devices to manage blood pressure and improve cardiovascular function for hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk,” commented David Hochman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Orchestra BioMed. “As we age, our arteries naturally lose elasticity and become stiffer, a process that increases the risk of cardiovascular problems and is linked to changes in blood pressure and heart function. One of the characteristics of this process is the development of diastolic dysfunction, a condition where the heart's ventricles cannot relax and fill with blood properly during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. Our late-breaking data in patients with diastolic dysfunction recently presented at THT showed AVIM therapy’s ability to significantly improve ventricular relaxation and passive filling, highlighting its potential to drive better clinical outcomes through blood pressure reduction, as well as improvement of cardiac function.""

“In parallel, we are encouraged by the progress of our Virtue SAB program as we actively prepare to initiate a U.S. coronary pivotal study with an updated trial design, currently under FDA review. The study is expected to randomize patients with coronary in-stent restenosis to treatment with Virtue SAB or Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon. We believe this design will optimally highlight the potential advantages of Virtue SAB’s proprietary design advantages which enables protected delivery of extended focal-release sirolimus without the need for a balloon coating,” continued Mr. Hochman. “With regard to our strategic partnership, we and Terumo are moving our negotiations into a formal mediation process. We believe this is the most efficient way to drive our relationship to a resolution, ideally during the second quarter of this year, ahead of potential initiation of the updated Virtue ISR-US pivotal study in the second half of the year.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights

Continued site activation and patient enrollment of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, in collaboration with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), evaluating the efficacy and safety of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy in hypertensive pacemaker patients.

Submitted a revised design to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the Virtue ISR-US pivotal study in coronary in-stent restenosis (“ISR”), which will randomize Virtue® Sirolimus AngioInfusion™ Balloon (“SAB”) against Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon; initiation is targeted for the second half of 2025, pending FDA approval of an amended investigational device exemption (“IDE”) which is expected to be secured in the second quarter of 2025.

To accelerate potential completion of ongoing partnership restructuring negotiations, Orchestra BioMed and Terumo have elected to enter a mediation process and are currently working on a procedural plan that would aim to conclude the mediation process in the second quarter of 2025.

Enhanced board of directors with the appointment of three highly experienced independent directors:

Christopher Cleary, former Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Medtronic, where he played a key role in establishing the strategic collaboration between Orchestra BioMed and Medtronic for AVIM therapy

John Mack, former President of Cardiac Surgery at Medtronic with extensive operational and strategic experience in the medical device industry

David Pacitti, Chief Executive Officer of Avanos Medical, former President of Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and Head of the Americas, Siemens Healthineers, with nearly 30 years of experience in cardiovascular device and procedural imaging

Strengthened senior leadership team with the appointment of Mark Pomeranz as Executive Vice President & General Manager, Interventional Therapies. Mr. Pomeranz has over two decades of experience in medical devices, with particular emphasis on cardiology and gastrointestinal verticals. He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of Motus GI Holdings.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2024

Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities totaled $66.8 million as of December 31, 2024. During the year, our cash inflows included approximately $15.0 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our Common Stock under a market sales agreement and approximately $15.0 million from the initial draw on our credit facility.

Net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets was $50.8 million during 2024, compared with $46.2 million for 2023, with the primary driver of this increase being increased cash outflows for research and development during 2024.

Revenue for 2024 was $2.6 million, compared with $2.8 million for 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased recognition of partnership revenues earned under the agreement with Terumo.

Research and development expenses for 2024 were $42.8 million, compared with $33.8 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional costs associated with the ongoing BACKBEAT global pivotal study.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 were $23.9 million, compared with $20.3 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based stock compensation.

Net loss for 2024 was $61.0 million, or ($1.66) per share, compared with a net loss of $49.1 million, or ($1.48) per share, for 2023. Net loss for the year-ended 2024 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, compared with $7.6 million for the same period in 2023.

About AVIM Therapy

AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized, pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) global pivotal study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.

About Virtue SAB

03/31/2025 - 04:21 PM

NEW HOPE, Pa., March 31, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orchestra BioMed Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: OBIO, “Orchestra BioMed” or the “Company”), a biomedical innovation company accelerating high-impact technologies to patients through risk-reward sharing partnerships, today reported its full year 2024 financial results and provided a fourth quarter business update.

""We remain highly focused on execution of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, which we believe has the potential to deliver landmark results that can establish AVIM therapy as a new standard of care for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension in patients already indicated for a pacemaker. We also believe it can lay the foundation for expanding use of AVIM-enabled devices to manage blood pressure and improve cardiovascular function for hypertensive patients with high cardiovascular risk,” commented David Hochman, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Founder of Orchestra BioMed. “As we age, our arteries naturally lose elasticity and become stiffer, a process that increases the risk of cardiovascular problems and is linked to changes in blood pressure and heart function. One of the characteristics of this process is the development of diastolic dysfunction, a condition where the heart's ventricles cannot relax and fill with blood properly during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. Our late-breaking data in patients with diastolic dysfunction recently presented at THT showed AVIM therapy’s ability to significantly improve ventricular relaxation and passive filling, highlighting its potential to drive better clinical outcomes through blood pressure reduction, as well as improvement of cardiac function.""

“In parallel, we are encouraged by the progress of our Virtue SAB program as we actively prepare to initiate a U.S. coronary pivotal study with an updated trial design, currently under FDA review. The study is expected to randomize patients with coronary in-stent restenosis to treatment with Virtue SAB or Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon. We believe this design will optimally highlight the potential advantages of Virtue SAB’s proprietary design advantages which enables protected delivery of extended focal-release sirolimus without the need for a balloon coating,” continued Mr. Hochman. “With regard to our strategic partnership, we and Terumo are moving our negotiations into a formal mediation process. We believe this is the most efficient way to drive our relationship to a resolution, ideally during the second quarter of this year, ahead of potential initiation of the updated Virtue ISR-US pivotal study in the second half of the year.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 and Recent Highlights

Continued site activation and patient enrollment of the BACKBEAT global pivotal study, in collaboration with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), evaluating the efficacy and safety of atrioventricular interval modulation (“AVIM”) therapy in hypertensive pacemaker patients.

Submitted a revised design to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the Virtue ISR-US pivotal study in coronary in-stent restenosis (“ISR”), which will randomize Virtue® Sirolimus AngioInfusion™ Balloon (“SAB”) against Boston Scientific’s AGENT drug-coated balloon; initiation is targeted for the second half of 2025, pending FDA approval of an amended investigational device exemption (“IDE”) which is expected to be secured in the second quarter of 2025.

To accelerate potential completion of ongoing partnership restructuring negotiations, Orchestra BioMed and Terumo have elected to enter a mediation process and are currently working on a procedural plan that would aim to conclude the mediation process in the second quarter of 2025.

Enhanced board of directors with the appointment of three highly experienced independent directors:

Christopher Cleary, former Senior Vice President of Corporate Development at Medtronic, where he played a key role in establishing the strategic collaboration between Orchestra BioMed and Medtronic for AVIM therapy

John Mack, former President of Cardiac Surgery at Medtronic with extensive operational and strategic experience in the medical device industry

David Pacitti, Chief Executive Officer of Avanos Medical, former President of Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc. and Head of the Americas, Siemens Healthineers, with nearly 30 years of experience in cardiovascular device and procedural imaging

Strengthened senior leadership team with the appointment of Mark Pomeranz as Executive Vice President & General Manager, Interventional Therapies. Mr. Pomeranz has over two decades of experience in medical devices, with particular emphasis on cardiology and gastrointestinal verticals. He most recently served as Chief Executive Officer of Motus GI Holdings.

Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2024

Cash and cash equivalents and Marketable securities totaled $66.8 million as of December 31, 2024. During the year, our cash inflows included approximately $15.0 million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our Common Stock under a market sales agreement and approximately $15.0 million from the initial draw on our credit facility.

Net cash used in operating activities and for the purchase of fixed assets was $50.8 million during 2024, compared with $46.2 million for 2023, with the primary driver of this increase being increased cash outflows for research and development during 2024.

Revenue for 2024 was $2.6 million, compared with $2.8 million for 2023. The decrease was primarily due to decreased recognition of partnership revenues earned under the agreement with Terumo.

Research and development expenses for 2024 were $42.8 million, compared with $33.8 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to additional costs associated with the ongoing BACKBEAT global pivotal study.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2024 were $23.9 million, compared with $20.3 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased expenses related to stock-based stock compensation.

Net loss for 2024 was $61.0 million, or ($1.66) per share, compared with a net loss of $49.1 million, or ($1.48) per share, for 2023. Net loss for the year-ended 2024 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, compared with $7.6 million for the same period in 2023.

About AVIM Therapy

AVIM therapy, also known as BackBeat CNT™, is an investigational therapy compatible with standard dual-chamber pacemakers designed to substantially and persistently lower blood pressure. It has been evaluated in pilot studies in patients with hypertension who are also indicated for a pacemaker. MODERATO II, a double-blind, randomized, pilot study, showed that patients treated with AVIM therapy experienced net reductions of 8.1 mmHg in 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (aSBP) and 12.3 mmHg in office systolic blood pressure (oSBP) at six months when compared to control patients. The BACKBEAT (BradycArdia paCemaKer with atrioventricular interval modulation for Blood prEssure treAtmenT) global pivotal study will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of AVIM therapy in lowering blood pressure in a similar target population of patients who have been indicated for, and recently implanted with, a dual-chamber cardiac pacemaker.

About Virtue SAB

Virtue SAB is a patented drug/device combination product candidate in development for the treatment of certain forms of artery disease that is designed to deliver a proprietary, investigational, extended-release formulation of sirolimus, SirolimusEFR™, to the vessel wall during balloon angioplasty without any coating on the balloon surface or the need to leave a stent or other permanent implant in the artery. Virtue SAB demonstrated positive three-year clinical data in coronary ISR in the SABRE study, a multi-center prospective, independent core lab-adjudicated clinical study conducted in Europe. Virtue SAB has been granted Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA for specific indications relating to coronary ISR, coronary small vessel disease and peripheral artery disease below-the-knee. Orchestra BioMed has a strategic partnership with Terumo (Terumo, TSE: 4543), a global leader in medical technology headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, as well as Terumo Medical Corporation, its U.S. subsidiary, to collaborate on the global development and commercialization of Virtue SAB in coronary and peripheral vascular indications.

The annual report said: “Despite strong growth from BBC Commercial, the BBC faces an unprecedented content funding challenge, as co-production partnerships with global streamers and media companies have reduced across the sector.

It also said it will “continue our ambitious programme of transformation to ensure the BBC is in the best shape to meet the challenges of a fast-changing media environment”, after having “a smaller, leaner workforce following an aggressive savings programme”.

It will continue to put out the investigative series Panorama on the morning of its evening broadcast, and “build on success” of having live broadcasts of current affairs programme Question Time on iPlayer.

Episodes of children’s news show Newsround, which is staying on CBBC and iPlayer, will be made available on YouTube for the first time.

The BBC is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence (AI), while being wary of the technology’s “many risks”.

In the report, the corporation said it was “trialling” using AI to help its journalists create live text pages from football broadcasts, “which could enable us to cover many more games as live text pages, and using AI to create automatic subtitles for BBC Sounds”.

It also said the BBC World Service will develop pilot services in new languages, as well as “enhance our efforts to counter disinformation in response to the increasing threat and in light of others withdrawing from the fact-checking ecosystem”.

BBC chairman Samir Shah said: “The BBC’s role has never been more important, both here in the UK and around the world, to deliver trusted, impartial news in a world of disinformation; develop and promote the most compelling homegrown content; and be the place where people come together for unforgettable shared moments.

“The BBC board fully endorses this plan, as we plot the long-term future of this marvellous organisation and deliver for audiences for generations to come.”

The corporation promised to publish the findings of an independent review of its workplace culture after several controversies involving high-profile presenters and TV shows.

BBC director-general Tim Davie said: “We are focused on our mission to deliver value for all, through our journalism, our storytelling and our unique ability to bring people together.

“The UK’s creative industry continues to change rapidly, as does the world around us. This plan sets out how the BBC continues to evolve for audiences, both on and off air, but also how we will support and invest in the wider industry.”",https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/03/31/12/a05a4f0aadf12ac60223b81f2467f53bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQzNTA4MDUz-2.5253900.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,N,,2025-03-31 16:04:17.981766

This move follows other chains entering the retail category, and Sam and Alicia talk about how this could be influenced by consumers pulling back on restaurant spending due to inflation.

This quarter was plagued by mounting tariff fears from the new administration, which should all come to a head on Wednesday, April 2 — a date President Donald Trump has dubbed ""Liberation Day."" Investors are holding out hope that on Wednesday, they'll receive some clarity and relief from the high volatility wracking equities in recent weeks. The S & P 500 , Dow Jones Industrial Average , and Nasdaq Composite are all on pace to end the quarter with losses. The S & P 500 is off more than 5%, while the Nasdaq is down 11%, and both are tracking for their worst quarterly performance since 2022. The Dow is on pace for a 2% loss in the period. Here are the 10 biggest outperformers in the S & P 500 for the first quarter. Coming in at first place was pharmacy retailer CVS Health , which has rallied more than 50% this quarter. On Feb. 12, shares popped 15% in a single day after CVS posted a big beat on its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. All signs point to the once-struggling retail chain beginning to right the ship, especially after CEO David Joyner took the helm last October. Following its earnings blowout, analysts at both Cantor Fitzgerald and Leerink Partners upgraded the stock. ""The pieces are in place for [CVS to return] from what has been a bottoming of operations performance,"" wrote Leerink analyst Michael Cherny. Another winning name was Philip Morris International . Shares of the tobacco giant have surged 31% in the first quarter. Philip Morris is another stock that belongs to the consumer staples sector. Investors have increasingly flocked to the category for its defensive attributes as emerging tariff policies threaten to shake up global supply chains. Earlier this month, Argus upgraded the stock to a buy rating from hold, citing the firm's nicotine pouches — which are especially popular with younger populations — as a major catalyst. ""We see revenue growth ahead driven by PM's nicotine pouches as management is now better enabled to market this smoke-free product and is committing capital expenses,"" the firm wrote. On the other hand, Deckers Outdoors — which owns brands such as UGG, Hoka and Teva — led the quarter's losses, with its 46% decline. Earlier this month, the stock was trading at lows not seen since 2024, reinforcing recent sentiment surveys indicating that consumers may be growing increasingly bearish on the economy. Beleaguered electric vehicle maker Tesla , down 37% this quarter, came in second place. The stock has eroded much of its post-election gains as investors have increasingly grown concerned about CEO Elon Musk's role in the new Trump administration. During a Sunday town hall event in Wisconsin, Bloomberg News reported that Musk said that his role within the newly created Department of Government Efficiency had hurt the stock . Debates have heated up between investors on whether Tesla's fundamentals have justified the stock's recent declines — or whether the market has unduly punished shares. In a recent note, Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro reiterated his buy rating on Tesla, but cut his price target by $19 to $455. This updated forecast is still 72% above where the stock closed on Friday. ""We expect share price volatility to persist in the near term, but remain optimistic on TSLA's medium- to long-term prospects and reiterate our Buy,"" Gengaro wrote.

Consumer discretionary, the worst performing sector, and I talked earlier about what was the worst performing stock in the S&P overall, not just consumer discretionary.
That is the worst performing stock in the S&P 500.
It's joined by Tesla and Las Vegas Sands, which have also been the worst performers in consumer discretionary.
What I think is really interesting, obviously, CVS is down today, but it seems like the best performers in the S&P year to date so far are just the underperformers from last year.","It is the last day of the first quarter. So we want to take a look at some of the best and worst performing stocks and sectors of the year so far. Consumer discretionary, the worst performing sector, and I talked earlier about what was the worst performing stock in the S&P overall, not just consumer discretionary. It's Deckers, owner of Uggs and Hoka. That is the worst performing stock in the S&P 500. It's joined by Tesla and Las Vegas Sands, which have also been the worst performers in consumer discretionary. They shared teasers earlier, Maddie, um, you know, that that this company came out with its earnings earlier in February, disappointed, disappointed with its forecast, and the stock has not recovered since. In fact, it has just continued to go down, even though, um, analysts broadly still like it.

Great teas.

I ordered a pair of Hokas for one of my kids this weekend. We're a big Hokas household. Hoka sales actually were up 24% in the quarter that they reported, but still there's concern about what's going on with this company going forward. And consumer discretionary, obviously, when we're seeing these consumer sentiment surveys that are weak, yes, Tesla is a big weight within that sector, of course, but there's also a close eye that people are keeping on on these other stocks to see if they're being affected by all this.

And I wonder to what extent some of that negativity around tariffs is getting priced into some of those consumer discretionary names, and maybe the hope is that over time, the real impact is not going to be as bad as is getting priced in right now. Maybe a lift later, but of course we, that remains to be seen. I did want to take a look at the good news for the quarter here. CVS is the top performing stock in the S&P 500 so far this year with health care bouncing back from its position as the weakest sector in 2024 to the second best performer year to date, lagging only energy. What I think is really interesting, obviously, CVS is down today, but it seems like the best performers in the S&P year to date so far are just the underperformers from last year. So perhaps that's a little bit of a rebalancing versus any positive catalyst for this individual stock. I should mention CVS has gotten quite a few price target hikes as of late. They've now got about 70% of the street with a buy, 30% with a hold rating on the stock. So getting a little bit of more positive momentum off the back of thoughts about them being able to handle their balance sheet a little bit more effectively, um, some potential M&A activity moving forward here for the company, slashing bonuses as well. That was another positive catalyst over the quarter. Um, but no huge fundamental change in the business that has a growth story attached that would make it the best performer in the S&P.

Right. I mean, we know that some people have migrated to some parts of health care as a sort of defensive posture. So that could certainly be part of the situation as well. I believe they got a new CEO late last year, so there's also some hopes that he's going to start to turn the company around.

Yeah, health care, financials, energy, some of the safe havens amid.

On a relative basis.

On a relative basis. Very well said. Yes.

I guess so, yeah.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/zLK3LxmFsVv72kVTcRMk8A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-03/dcf286f0-0e36-11f0-b7f6-7125d41dddd1,N,,2025-03-31 12:23:00.992416

Sustainability suffers from mixed signals. Search trends are showing a renewed interest in plant-based options, particularly during festive periods, highlighting an opportunity for brands to align with consumer desires for ethical consumption. However, the decline in pre-loved clothing searches suggests that convenience is overshadowing sustainable choices, a gap that sustainable brands need to address by facilitating a seamless consumer experience.",https://www.publicisgroupeuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fav-50x50.png,N,,2025-04-01 03:00:07.382990

Part of its strategy is to continue expanding, and plans to open restaurants in North Carolina this year.
The executive left the fast-food chain in 2016, and founded L3 Commercial Development in Raleigh, North Carolina a year later.
The former McDonald's employee, who's based in North Carolina, confirmed he would be moving to San Antonio.","Whataburger has recruited former McDonald's executive Todd Ewen to help fast-track its continuing growth.

The US fast-food chain confirmed Ewen would be taking on the role as senior vice president and chief development officer on March 24.

'I look forward to helping the leadership team reach the important growth goals they've spelled out,' Ewen said.

Whataburger is understood to have poached the US-born Ewen, who has 20 years of experience, to help continue its successful nationwide expansion.

'We plan to bring Honey Butter Biscuits and great hospitality to more than 24 million new customers this year,' said Whataburger Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer Alexander Ivannikov.

'Todd's deep understanding of real estate in the quick service restaurant industry will be integral in helping Whataburger execute our growth strategy, bringing delicious food and a great experience to new markets and new fans.'

With this new role, Ewen will be going from working with the world's biggest burger chain to the top 100 largest in the US.

The Golden arches has 14,000 locations in the US alone, compared to just over 1,000 Whataburger restaurants.

The Texas-based chain is working on its five-year growth plan, which president and CEO Debbie Stroud confirmed they review 'every year.'

Stroud explained the review helps them decide where they can have the best impact.

Part of its strategy is to continue expanding, and plans to open restaurants in North Carolina this year.

'For North Carolina specifically, this year it's the Charlotte and surrounding areas, next year it will be Raleigh and surrounding areas,' Stroud told QSR.

The Texas-based chain has already expanded to six additional states, including Florida and Georgia.

It is also preparing to open another location in San Antonio, Texas, through a partnership with Love's Travel Shops.

Whataburger has not revealed its 2025 sales outlook, but it made over $4 billion in revenue last year.

Stroud noted the company is planning to expand to other states in the future, but that fans will have to 'stay tuned.'

Ewen began his career as a commercial real estate officer with US Bank Corporation in 2000.

He was named a McDonald's regional real estate manager in 2009, and became its development director in 2013.

The executive left the fast-food chain in 2016, and founded L3 Commercial Development in Raleigh, North Carolina a year later.

During those years, he led more than $300 million in lease and purchase transactions and networked with other brokers, developers, and investors.

Ewen thanked the 'incredible people' he's worked with, adding that he knew Whataburger was 'something special' in a post on LinkedIn.

The former McDonald's employee, who's based in North Carolina, confirmed he would be moving to San Antonio.

Besides the expansion, Whataburger is celebrating its 75th birthday with various offers.

One of its menu additions was the Monterey Melt, which the chain claimed was a highly requested item on Instagram and Reddit.

Whataburger also began offering Mexican Hot Chocolate Coffee and the Mexican Hot Chocolate Shake.

Other features the chain launched to celebrate its birthday include a new 'digital home' and announced a collaboration with popular apparel brand Wrangler.

The company plans to offer a variety of other deals and contests leading up to its birthday on August 8.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/16/96680703-0-image-m-47_1743180615495.jpg,N,,2025-03-30 19:00:47.328998

Lululemon’s bespoke fabrics and meticulously produced workout gear have earned it a loyal following since it opened its first store in Vancouver, Canada, in 2000. Under McDonald’s leadership, the brand has pushed beyond its yoga roots into producing sportswear for runners, golfers and tennis players. It wants to dominate in menswear and even sells chino-like trousers and shirts for the trendy executive. Today, Lululemon operates 767 stores in 22 countries.

But after years of stellar performance, the brand has run into a sticky patch. Last week, Lululemon disappointed Wall Street by forecasting that underlying sales will only grow by between 5 per cent and 7 per cent this year. The root of the slowdown is in the US, where cautious consumers are reining in spending against a backdrop of persistent inflation and the threat of a recession induced by Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.

“What we have seen coming out of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter is a much more cautious consumer in the US,” says McDonald. “Industry traffic numbers are down dramatically and we’ve seen our traffic change as well.”

• Lululemon stretches into standalone Grafton Street store

Lululemon’s boss says that customers — he calls them “guests” — are enthusiastic about the brand’s new product ranges. But Wall Street, apparently, does not want to listen. Despite reporting operating profit of $2.5 billion, a 17 per cent increase, Lululemon’s shares fell by 14 per cent last Friday to close the week at $293, valuing the company at $36 billion (£28 billion).

Neil Saunders, the US-based managing director of consultancy GlobalData Retail, says: “Lululemon is a tremendously successful brand. They have great customer loyalty and they are great at the technical side of things. But they are at a tipping point. Growth in North America is really quite weak now, there is a lot more competition and they are kind of saturated in that market.”

McDonald dismisses such talk and says Lululemon is winning market share. He reaffirmed his commitment to hitting a target, set in 2021, to double the company’s sales to $12.5 billion by 2026. The brand’s total sales rose by 10 per cent to $10.6 billion last year on the back of strong growth in China.

“Lululemon is in the early stages of its growth journey. I’ve doubled the business once, am about to double it again and see [the potential] to double it a third time,” says a defiant McDonald.

Lululemon was founded by Chip Wilson, who was inspired to make comfortable yoga clothing after attending his first class in 1998. The brand grew through partnerships with “ambassadors”, including fitness influencers and yoga studio owners, who work closely with the company in their local market to co-ordinate Lululemon-sponsored fitness events.

An obsession with exercise pervades the company. Its London office contains a fitness studio, where staff are encouraged to break up their day with a yoga class or HIIT (high intensity interval training) session. Employees are even given vouchers worth £200 each month to put towards their own exercise classes.

Lululemon expanded into the US in 2003, floated on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 2007 and arrived on these shores — with a store in London’s Covent Garden — in 2014.

By that time, Wilson had stepped down as chairman in the aftermath of a car-crash TV interview in which he argued that problems with Lululemon’s leggings becoming see-through were down to the size of some women’s thighs. He has regularly hurled rocks at the company from the sidelines ever since.

Last year, Wilson expressed his distaste for Lululemon’s “whole diversity and inclusion thing” and complained that the brand’s push into new product lines — such as its “appalling” men’s dress shirts — showed it was “trying to become like the Gap, everything to everybody”. McDonald is reluctant to get dragged into a war of words with the company’s outspoken founder but says he believes customers should choose brands, rather than brands choosing their customers.

And as for diversity policies, which are being rolled back across the corporate spectrum in the wake of Trump’s re-election, McDonald insists there will be no backtracking: “We believe in inclusion — that everyone inside Lululemon should be able to feel and bring a full version of themselves [to work].”

Despite last week’s wobble, Lululemon’s shares are still up by 125 per cent since McDonald took the reins in August 2018.

The chief executive says that his company’s technical expertise in fabrics has been at the heart of its success. Its creations include a new range of “Glow Up” leggings for women, produced in a new version of its nylon-derived “Nulu” fabric and priced at £108 a pair, which were in development for four years.

“Almost every garment we have is rooted in a fabric that’s been engineered and designed to provide a solution to … an unmet need of the athlete. And then we obsess over its creation,” says McDonald, adding that premium prices are justified by premium materials.

For men, McDonald calls out Lululemon’s ABC trousers, which contain an “ergonomic gusset” that removes tension from the crotch area. (ABC, by the way, stands for “anti-ball crushing”.) He explains that the trousers, which sell for £118, are made in Lululemon’s “anti-stink” fabric, which has silver ions woven into it to stop the spread of odour-causing bacteria.

• Lululemon: the leggings to show-off in

McDonald wants menswear to contribute between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of total sales, up from about a quarter today. The brand is crossing the gender divide with the help of endorsements from tennis player Frances Tiafoe and Formula 1 driver Sir Lewis Hamilton. McDonald, who is no slouch himself, professes to be in awe of Hamilton’s dedication. “His fitness and recovery programme is among the most intense I have ever seen … it’s incredible,” he gushes.

Lululemon’s super-healthy boss grew up in London, Ontario. Initially, he wanted to be a vet and then, in a sharp change of tack, toyed with the idea of becoming a homicide detective. McDonald was drawn to forensics as a way of indulging his problem-solving inclinations but found, eventually, that a career in business offered that opportunity in an altogether less grisly environment.

McDonald won a graduate job at the head office of Loblaws, the Canadian supermarket chain owned by the Weston family, and ended up staying for 17 years. He started out in merchandising and went on to lead divisions including buying and product development.

Eventually he craved a change and agreed to become chief executive of Sears Canada, a struggling department store chain, in 2011. A little over two years later, McDonald moved south of the border to San Francisco for a more prosperous time at Sephora, the LVMH-backed beauty retailing giant, where he ran its Americas business.

McDonald is trying to revitalise Lululemon’s US business against a tumultuous backdrop. Trump’s tariffs will squeeze profit margins on the “small proportion” of products it produces in China. The president’s talk of turning Canada into America’s 51st state won’t help, either. Prince William donned a green Lululemon puffer jacket during his visit to Estonia last week, in what was interpreted as a subtle show of support for Canada.

“As a Canadian, [the tensions are] concerning because the US and Canada have shared such a wonderful and long friendship,” says McDonald, adding that he does not foresee any business problems as a result.

While much of McDonald’s focus is on reinvigorating demand in the US, and sustaining growth in China, where sales grew by 41 per cent last year, Lululemon is also nurturing its UK business, its largest market in Europe, with 21 stores. In February, the company opened a two-storey flagship store on London’s Regent Street, its largest outlet in Europe, and another store will open in the autumn down the road in Soho.

McDonald wants overseas markets — which collectively contribute a quarter of Lululemon’s sales — to eventually make up 50 per cent of the total.

“We are definitely not hitting a ceiling of growth,” he vows. “We want to be the number one choice of athletes in the world.”

Working day

Calvin McDonald spends about a third of his time travelling overseas, but when in Vancouver he arrives at Lululemon’s head office between 8am and 8.30am, after either a bike ride or a swim. He fits in a workout at lunch and might squeeze one in when he gets home, too.

The chief executive of Lululemon spends most of his working day in one-to-ones or team meetings — he says his leadership philosophy is to “co-create”, rather than present or dictate to his team — and allocates a “disproportionate” amount of time to meeting with his product teams. McDonald typically leaves the office between 5.30pm and 6pm.

Focusing on core businesses with strategic advancements and exits, continuously amplifying the ""flywheel effect""

To achieve more effective resource allocation and drive sustainable value growth, Fosun has integrated its profound industry expertise, extensive investment experience, and high-quality commercial resources with the operations and investments of insurance companies, forming a three-dimensional ""insurance + industry + investment"" flywheel-driven strategy.

Fosun's unique ecosystem synergy model has further amplified the flywheel effect. In 2024, it successfully implemented the ""health care + insurance"" ecosystem policy model, with 14,000 community health care policies sold, totaling premiums of RMB12.85 billion.

In addition, Sisram Medical is exploring the use of AI for precise skin analysis and personalized skin care solutions, etc.

Focusing on core businesses with strategic advancements and exits, continuously amplifying the ""flywheel effect""

In 2024, Fosun Pharma increased its stake in Fosun Kairos to 100% to continuously focus on the R&D, manufacturing and commercialization of CAR-T cell therapy. In October 2024, the ULTRAMED Hainan project in Sanya was officially launched.

To achieve more effective resource allocation and drive sustainable value growth, Fosun has integrated its profound industry expertise, extensive investment experience, and high-quality commercial resources with the operations and investments of insurance companies, forming a three-dimensional ""insurance + industry + investment"" flywheel-driven strategy.

Fosun's unique ecosystem synergy model has further amplified the flywheel effect. In 2024, it successfully implemented the ""health care + insurance"" ecosystem policy model, with 14,000 community health care policies sold, totaling premiums of RMB12.85 billion. Fosun Care achieved profitability for the first time, laying a solid foundation for flywheel development.

As part of its strategic direction, Fosun made significant progress in asset-light operations in 2024. Fosun Pharma, together with the Shenzhen Guidance Fund and other investors, established a RMB5.0 billion biopharmaceutical industry fund to jointly promote the high-quality development of the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry in the Greater Bay Area, marking a significant milestone in the implementation of Fosun's asset-light strategy.

Focusing on ""Developing Business for Good""

In 2024, Fosun centered on its corporate values of ""Self-improvement, Teamwork, Performance, and Contribution to Society"" to promote the deep integration of the ESG strategy and commercial value.

In terms of global public health cooperation, Fosun has actively participated in the ""China-Africa Community Sustainability Action Network"", contributing to the health development of African communities. Fosun Pharma has consistently contributed to the ""China Solution"", and announced that it would donate RMB10 million worth of artemisinin-based anti-malaria medicines to Africa in the next three years.

The report, submitted to the Ministry of Energy & Green Transition, found that ECG management’s negligence directly caused a backlog of containers at the Tema Port, resulting in over GHS 909 million in demurrage charges.

According to the report, contrary to claims of financial constraints, the investigation found no evidence supporting ECG’s justification for failing to clear the containers.

The committee identified over-procurement as a major issue, worsened in 2023 when the Procurement Directorate was merged with the Premises & Estates Directorate. The Director of Procurement, Premises & Estates admitted that most of the stranded containers were procured under his tenure and acknowledged that ECG acquired more materials than needed due to pressure and influence from top management, particularly the then-Managing Director.

The report states that the former MD awarded contracts to specific suppliers without following competitive procurement processes, leading to excessive spending. This mismanagement resulted in ECG exceeding its 2023 procurement budget by billions of cedis.

The report revealed that investigators also revealed that 1,346 containers, valued at over USD 489 million, remain unaccounted for, including high-value equipment like transformers.

“Despite ECG’s claim of financial difficulties, the company awarded and pre-financed a clearing contract worth GHS 30 million to Mint Logistics Ltd while failing to clear essential equipment.”

“Additionally, a clearing contract worth GHS 127.65 million was awarded to a company that was not a registered Customs House Agent, even though ECG is a self-declarant capable of handling its own shipments.“

“Another company, Dawards Bond Ltd., fraudulently cleared 47 containers without paying the required duties and delivered only 46 to ECG. The company now demands GHS 5.29 million for services rendered, while the evaded taxes on these shipments amount to nearly GHS 4.8 million.”

The report suggests that the port backlog was deliberately created to justify awarding third-party clearing contracts totaling GHS 159.65 million, despite ECG having a fully functional shipping unit capable of handling the process internally.

Tofutti Brands, Inc. (TOFB) has submitted its Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.

The company reported net sales of $8,820,000, a decrease of 12% from the previous year. This decline was primarily due to increased competition in the plant-based cheese market and a general decline in ice cream sales.

Gross profit for the year was $2,251,000, down from $2,797,000 in the previous year. The gross profit margin decreased from 28% to 26%, attributed to increased costs of packaging and key ingredients.

Operating expenses totaled $2,858,000, a decrease of 6% from the previous year. This decrease was mainly due to reduced selling and warehousing expenses.

Tofutti reported a net loss of $860,000 for the fiscal year, compared to a net loss of $366,000 in the prior year.

The company's cash balance at the end of the fiscal year was $462,000, down from $837,000 at the end of the previous year. Working capital also decreased from $3,440,000 to $2,893,000.

Tofutti Brands continues to focus on expanding its product line of plant-based, dairy-free products while managing competition and cost pressures.

The company highlighted its reliance on a limited number of suppliers and distributors, which poses a risk to its supply chain and sales.

Tofutti's management noted the importance of maintaining strong customer relationships and the potential impact of economic conditions on consumer spending.

The company does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future, as it plans to reinvest earnings into business operations.

Tofutti's board of directors and management continue to address internal control weaknesses, particularly in financial reporting and resource allocation.","https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_200,q_80,w_200/4716932d29f4ef6064940c18eaab1f3d.png",N,,2025-03-29 15:59:32.781704

That's why it's such a troubling sign that the brand has been performing poorly as of late.

""While we anticipated a challenging environment in 2024, our performance so far this year has fallen short of our expectations,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in the company's third-quarter earnings call, reported TheStreet.

Kempczinski attributes the company's poor performance, in part, to the fact that ""consumers, especially those in the low-income category, were choosing to eat at home more often,"" and said that this is an industry-wide trend.

However, he also believes part of the problem may be that McDonald's has ""lost its way and ceded an important part of its brand identity to rivals.""

Kempczinski's warnings about McDonald's are important because of what they say about the economy as a whole. But those who like to eat at McDonald's should also consider what the statements suggest might happen to the cost of their favorite fast-food meal.

Poor performance at McDonald's could be a sign of a troubled economy

The downturn at McDonald's is important for everyone to pay attention to. The drop in sales — especially by people with lower incomes — could mean that people simply do not feel they have the money to eat out right now, even at inexpensive places like McDonald's.

The data backs this up. A report by PYMNTS revealed that 98% of people who live paycheck to paycheck have changed their behavior to deal with rising prices at restaurants, including eating out less often or “trading down” to lower-cost items on the menu.

This probably isn't a surprise to most people who have been coping with economic uncertainty in recent years.

In the aftermath of the pandemic, inflation surged to multidecade highs. Food and energy — two essential expenses you can't escape — saw especially big price increases, and people are feeling the pain.

In fact, the Pew Research Center found that 63% of Americans described inflation as a ""very big problem,"" in 2025, and one that affects their overall perceptions of the economy, with 45% of people saying the economy is only in fair shape and 31% describing it as being in poor shape.

Sadly, the consequences of struggling consumers extend beyond the impact on McDonald's profits.

""Restaurants are a canary in the coal mine,” Michael Halen, a senior restaurant and food service analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence told Marketplace in 2024.

“Typically, you know, you see a slowdown in consumer discretionary spending in restaurants before you see it in other places.”

If there is a general slowdown in consumer spending, this raises the risk of a recession as reduced demand means companies tend to cut back, which in turn can increase unemployment and lead to further cuts — all of which impedes economic growth.

McDonald's is focusing on value, so the price to you could soon fall

While McDonald's problems may indicate a reason to worry about the economy as a whole, there is a little bit of good news. Kempczinski has said the fast-food chain is going to shift its focus back to providing the best value for customers so people will feel like eating there is within reach — even while overall economic conditions aren't great.

""We have moved with urgency in partnership with our franchisees to improve our value offerings in most of our major markets,"" Kempczinski said.

Some examples he cited include discounted happy meals in France, three for 3 pounds meal deals in the UK, and coffee for a dollar in Canada.

""As we have said before, we view good value as including both entry-level items and meal bundles at affordable price points,"" Kempczinski explained.

This includes Every Day Affordable Price Menus that have ""compelling entry-level price points"" for things like breakfast, as well as on beef and chicken sandwiches for lunch and dinner.

McDonald's is not the only fast-food chain looking to capture the limited consumer dollars people feel comfortable spending.

Wendy's has introduced a $3 breakfast meal, while Jack in the Box plans to offer more value items as well.

“Value is going to be something we talk about for the rest of the year,” Jack in the Box CEO Darin Harris told investors in 2024, reported Restaurant Business, when a slowdown in fast-food consumption was starting to emerge.

“We know the competition is doing that. So we will be in the game.”

So, as McDonald's focuses on showing people it’s still affordable during challenging economic times, more people may once again start stopping in to the Golden Arches for a good deal — even if economic conditions as a whole have them feeling like they don't have quite enough.

Société Générale Morocco : 2024 marked by shareholder change and mixed results

Yabiladi Publié dans Yabiladi le 28 - 03 - 2025

The Supervisory Board of Société Générale Maroc, chaired by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, met on March 25 to finalize the accounts for the 2024 fiscal year. This year marks a strategic turning point: the bank's acquisition by the Saham Group, bringing an end to Société Générale's presence in Morocco.

The transition to Saham ownership was executed smoothly, ensuring service quality remained unaffected. A well-managed separation from the French group allowed for a seamless shift in operations. This acquisition opens a new chapter for the institution, which now seeks to strengthen its autonomy and tailor its business model to the Moroccan market.

Despite this structural shift, business activity remained strong. Deposits grew by 8.94%, reaching 80.1 billion dirhams, while outstanding loans totaled 93.9 billion dirhams. Net Banking Income (NBI) increased by 4.17% to 5.8 billion dirhams.

However, financial performance was impacted by two exceptional charges: a provision related to the empowerment program and a tax audit, amounting to 800 million dirhams. Without these costs, consolidated net income would have stood at 1.4 billion dirhams. After accounting for them, it declined to 795 million dirhams, reflecting a 41.61% drop.

Despite the decline in profits, the bank maintains some of the strongest prudential ratios in the market, with a solvency ratio of 14.61% and a Core Tier 1 ratio of 13.86%. With a solid financial foundation and a strategy focused on efficiency and growth, the bank looks to the future with confidence under its new shareholder.

After almost a decade, McDonald's has once again claimed the title of the world's most valuable restaurant brand. Surpassing Starbucks, which has experienced a challenging year, McDonald's now sits at the top of the 2025 Brand Finance rankings. Starbucks, previously the leader for eight consecutive years, has seen its brand value decline significantly, shedding 36% of its worth due to growing customer dissatisfaction and competition.

The Fall of Starbucks

In 2025, Starbucks' brand value dropped to $38.8 billion from $60.7 billion the previous year. This decline is attributed to several factors, including poor sales performance, a misalignment with customer expectations, and a focus on app-based sales that has alienated traditional customers. Furthermore, the coffee chain has faced negative publicity following a high-profile boycott campaign, which tarnished its reputation, especially in key international markets like the US and China.

Starbucks’ new CEO, Brian Niccol, is working to turn things around by implementing a “Back to Starbucks” strategy. This plan includes simplifying the menu, reducing discount-driven offers, and cutting over 1,000 corporate roles. Despite these efforts, Starbucks is struggling to recover its position at the top, particularly as it faces challenges from up-and-coming competitors like Luckin Coffee, which has quickly overtaken Starbucks as China’s largest coffee chain.

McDonald's Dominates the Market

Meanwhile, McDonald's has proven resilient, experiencing a 7% increase in its brand value, now sitting at $40.5 billion. The fast-food giant’s strong brand recognition and customer loyalty have allowed it to maintain its leadership in the sector. McDonald's is also known for its ability to adapt to consumer preferences by adding fan-favorite items, such as the McCrispy Wrap, and launching promotions like the $5 Meal Deal and Buy One, Add One for $1 specials through its 'McValue' platform.

This commitment to offering value and consistency has helped McDonald's maintain its strong market presence. In addition, the chain's global reach, with over 43,000 restaurants, ensures it remains a top choice for customers around the world.

Brand Value and the Future of Fast Food

As McDonald’s continues to innovate and maintain its dominance in the fast-food industry, it faces competition from other brands like KFC and Subway, both of which have also seen increases in their brand values. However, the decline of Starbucks highlights the volatility within the restaurant industry. As consumer preferences shift, brands like McDonald's that can maintain strong customer relationships and adapt to changing trends are poised for success.

What Lies Ahead for Starbucks?

While Starbucks has experienced a sharp drop in brand value, the company is not giving up. The launch of the ""Back to Starbucks"" plan is designed to refocus the brand on its core strengths. However, with leadership instability and increasing competition from brands like Luckin Coffee, Starbucks has a long road ahead to reclaim its spot at the top.

The Rise of Luckin Coffee

Luckin Coffee, which overtook Starbucks in China, has seen its brand value rise by 17% to $1.7 billion. The company has made significant strides by offering affordable coffee options and aggressively expanding its store network, with 1,382 new store openings in just one quarter. Luckin Coffee's ability to challenge Starbucks in China and expand into the US marks a major shift in the global coffee landscape.

Is This the Beginning of Starbucks' Downfall?

While McDonald's reigns supreme in 2025, it raises a critical question: Is Starbucks' decline a temporary setback, or is it the beginning of a more significant downfall? With shifting customer expectations, increased competition from players like Luckin Coffee, and internal restructuring, Starbucks has its work cut out to regain its former glory. As consumers demand more from their favorite brands, can Starbucks adapt and reclaim its position, or will McDonald's continue to dominate the fast-food scene for years to come? Time will tell, but one thing is certain—both brands will need to evolve to stay relevant in this fiercely competitive market.

NEW DELHI, Mar 28: Leading sporting goods retailer Decathlon generated over Rs 4,000 crore revenue in India and became profitable in FY24 posting gains of Rs 197.19 crore, according to an RoC filing by the company.

Decathlon Sports India Pvt Ltd has reported its revenue from operations at Rs 4,008.26 crore, up 2.24 per cent for the financial year that ended on March 31, 2024.

It had reported a loss of Rs 18.61 crore in FY23 and its revenue from operations was at Rs 3,920.31 crore on a standalone basis, according to financial data accessed through the business intelligence platform Tofler.

The company’s total income was at Rs 4,066.40 crore in FY24 — the highest for Decathlon Sports in India in the last five years — reaching nearly half a billion USD from sales.

Its operating revenue in FY22 was at Rs 2,897.77 crore, Rs 2,049.28 crore in FY21, and Rs 2,208.39 crore in FY20.

Decathlon Sports India is a subsidiary of leading French sporting goods retailer Decathlon SE. It mainly engaged in the trading of sports goods, sports apparel, sports equipment, sports accessories, and other sports goods.

In FY24, Decathlon’s spending on advertising promotions was up 33 per cent to Rs 87.49 crore.

Decathlon Sports India’s sales at stores in FY24 were at Rs 3,430.67 crore, while its B2B sales were at Rs 117.68 crore.

However, its sales from e-commerce channels declined 2.2 per cent to Rs 437.07 crore as against Rs 446.75 crore in FY23.

The company entered India by starting production in 1999 and retail operations in 2009. According to earlier media reports, the company has so far invested 100 million euros and has plans to invest another 100 million euros in the next five years.

Last year, Decathlon had said India is a “big priority” market and expects it to be among its top five global markets within five years. (PTI)",https://cdndailyexcelsior.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Dec.jpg,N,,2025-03-29 07:02:30.382111

Regular ATMs are everywhere you go, but bitcoin ATMs are harder to come by – for now.

Bitcoin Depot is changing that. It’s already rolled out 8,400 bitcoin ATMs, leading the way in a global market that’s got plenty of room for expansion.

Nearly 90% of those crypto ATMs are in the US – and though there’s lots of untapped growth in the country, this firm is going global too. And a market of that size makes this a serious growth play.

Unlike crypto exchanges, Bitcoin Depot’s revenue doesn’t depend on bitcoin being in an upswing. Instead, it makes money on transactions. And there are lots of those: over $3 billion so far.

The company is aware of the high prices it is known for, and the chief has laid out her thoughts on how Levi's can navigate that image.

Part of this includes leaning on things that have worked well in the past, such as its lucrative partnership with Beyoncé.

Levi’s CEO Michelle Gass noted the interesting position it finds itself in, and consumers become warier about spending money.

It makes it harder to attract audiences, but Gass hopes that the company's image will be enough, as reported by Retail Dive.

She said: ""Are the consumers going to be more choiceful? Yes, but I think in times like this, where there's more pressure and more uncertainty, consumers also go to brands that they trust and that they love, and we're definitely one of those.

""But it's up to us. If the wallet’s tighter, then we have to work harder.

""We have to work harder in driving brand relevance.

""We’ve got to make sure that every single time they're coming into one of our stores, it's a phenomenal experience.

""And we’ve got to keep innovating and bringing them newness and things that they can't resist buying. That's our job.

""There are jeans that cost a lot more, there are jeans that cost less.

""But it is an approachable price point to start.""

Retail Dive reported that consumers are growing more pessimistic about the future of retail.

Consumer expectations for employment, personal income and business conditions during the next six months reportedly plunged in March to a 12-year low.

A BEYONCE MOMENT

To tackle the turning tide, Levi's has a few tricks up its jeans.

One of the main ways it plans to do this is remaining on top of the cultural conversation through its Beyoncé partnership.

The brand saw a huge lift last year when Beyoncé unexpectedly named a song on her latest album after Levi's.

The outlet pass_by even reported that Levi's saw a 19.87% increase in visits to its stores after the single came out.

Since then, Levi's has launched a brand campaign with the global megastar at the forefront.

The second of these ads, titled ""Chapter 2: Pool Hall"" dropped recently.

It sees the singer play pool in a pair of Levi's jeans.

The generated lift is something Levi's is eager to make the most of, as was confirmed by Gass.

She continued: ""The company's had a relationship with Beyoncé for decades — goes back to the ‘90s, when she was part of Destiny's Child.

""As the story goes, they were looking for brands to partner with them and they got lots of no's. Levi’s said yes.""

LEVI'S VS. THE WORLD

Another way the brand plans to remain relevant is by paying attention itself to what is relevant in style.

Levi's wants to better appeal to the female market, as Gass said that little more than 30% of its shoppers are women now.

To get more women in stores, the brand pays attention to its store managers who often tell them what’s missing from the assortment or what’s performing well.

Having Beyoncé on your team is also a good way to go about appealing to more women.

Gass elaborated: ""My first year before becoming CEO, I traveled the world with the team.

""I spent lots of time in stores, examined the categories.

""This is probably a simple example, but going into one of our stores, we had lots of denim bottoms for women — we had very few skirts, very few dresses.

""We should have an iconic denim skirt, just like we have an iconic 501. And those weren't key categories for us.

""So we start with: We should own everything denim dressing.""

Gass finished my underlining the importance of focusing on the details when it comes to fashion retailing.

She concluded: ""There are many examples over time of brands who have not stayed relevant, who have not stayed fresh.

""There's also examples who lose their way, right?

""There's a lot of nuancing — of really getting it right.""",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/03/2017-levi-strauss-sign-wall-953916184.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-03-28 16:03:09.906566

The gross profit improved 15% year over year to $2.2 billion. Also, the gross margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 60.4%, led by a 160-bps rise in the product margin, lower markdowns and improved shrink. This was partly offset by a 30-bps deleverage on fixed costs, 30-bps negative impacts of foreign exchange and higher air freight.

Management also noted that gross margin growth in the quarter was 30 bps ahead of its guidance. The upside was primarily driven by higher revenue leverage, disciplined fixed expense management within the gross margin and favorable-than-anticipated foreign exchange impacts. We expected the gross margin to expand 30 bps year over year to 59.7% for the fiscal fourth quarter.

SG&A expenses of $1.1 billion increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues of 31.5% rose 60 bps from 30.9% in the prior-year quarter. The increase in SG&A expense rate was less than the leverage of 80-90 bps anticipated by the company due to the improved top line.

Our model predicted SG&A expenses to rise 14.6% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter, with a 90-bps increase in the SG&A expense rate to 31.8%.

The operating income rose 14% year over year to $1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. The operating margin of 28.9% expanded 40 bps year over year. Our model predicted an 8.5% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income. We estimated the operating margin to decline 70 bps year over year to 27.8%.

Snapshot of lululemon’s Store Plans

In fourth-quarter fiscal 2024, LULU opened 18 company-operated stores and completed 16 optimizations. This brought total store openings to 56 stores in fiscal 2024, including 14 company-operated stores from the acquisition of the Mexico operations. As of Feb. 2, 2025, the company operated 767 stores.

For fiscal 2025, LULU aims to expand its square footage by about 10% through store openings and its ongoing optimization efforts. The company plans to strengthen its presence in existing markets while entering new ones, including Italy as a company-operated market, and Denmark, Belgium, Turkey and the Czech Republic through a franchise model.

For fiscal 2025, the company anticipates 40-50 net new company-operated stores. It also expects to complete 40 co-located optimizations. LULU expects overall square footage growth of 10% for fiscal 2025. The store openings in fiscal 2025 will include 10-15 stores in the Americas. The rest of the store openings in fiscal 2025 are expected to occur in the international markets, primarily in China.

LULU’s Other Financial Details

lululemon exited fiscal 2024 with cash and cash equivalents of $2 billion. The company had $393.9 million of capacity under its committed revolving credit facility and stockholders’ equity of $4.3 billion. Its inventories rose 9% year over year to $1.4 billion. Capital expenditure was $235 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.

In the fiscal fourth quarter, lululemon repurchased 0.9 million shares for $332.2 million at an average price of $354. In fiscal 2024, the company has repurchased 5.1 million shares for $1.6 billion. As of Feb. 2, 2025, it had $1.3 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.

lululemon’s Targets for Q1 & FY25?

LULU is excited about building on its momentum in fiscal 2025 while staying adaptable in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties. With significant opportunities ahead, the company remains confident in its ability to drive sustainable growth and deliver long-term value for all stakeholders. However, the company anticipates higher costs and ongoing uncertainty due to the impacts of increased tariffs on imports from China and Mexico.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, management anticipates net revenues of $2.335-$2.355 billion, indicating 6-7% year-over-year growth. This also includes one percentage point negative impact of adverse currency rates. The company expects the gross margin to be flat year over year, as a modest improvement in the product margin is expected to be offset by deleverage on fixed costs. Markdowns are expected to be relatively flat with the prior-year quarter.

SG&A, as a percentage of sales, is expected to deleverage 120 bps year over year, driven by higher foundational investments and associated depreciation, as well as strategic initiatives to enhance brand awareness and support growth. The operating margin for the fiscal first quarter is expected to decline 120 bps year over year.

EPS for the fiscal first quarter is expected to be $2.53-$2.58, whereas it reported EPS of $2.54 in the prior-year quarter. EPS is expected to include a negative currency impact of 6 cents per share. LULU estimates an effective tax rate of 30% for the fiscal first quarter. The company expects dollar inventory to increase in the high-teens in the fiscal first quarter.

For fiscal 2025, LULU anticipates net revenues of $11.15-$11.3 billion, indicating 5-7% year-over-year growth. Excluding the 53rd week in 2024, revenues are expected to rise 7-8%. The company’s guidance assumes modestly positive revenue growth in the U.S. for fiscal 2025. Revenue guidance also includes an additional one percentage point negative impact from adverse currency rates.

lululemon expects a 60-bps year-over-year decline in the gross margin, driven by fixed cost deleverage, foreign exchange headwinds, and higher tariffs on imports from China and Mexico. Markdowns are expected to be relatively in line with fiscal 2024.

The SG&A expense rate is expected to rise 40-50 bps year over year for fiscal 2025, driven by ongoing investments into its Power of Three x2 plan and currency headwinds. Throughout fiscal 2025, the company plans to invest in marketing and brand building to enhance awareness and attract guests, support international growth and market expansion, and strengthen its technology and data analytics capabilities.

LULU expects the fiscal 2025 operating margin to contract 100 bps year over year. The company continues to be mindful of planning expenses while investing in its strategic roadmap to drive growth. The company noted that it is navigating headwinds from foreign exchange and tariffs, and absorbing additional costs compared with last year, including reinstating store labor hours, travel and incentive compensation.

The company projects an EPS of $14.95-$15.15, suggesting an increase from the $14.64 reported in fiscal 2024. It expects currency headwinds to hurt EPS by 30-35 cents per share. LULU anticipates an effective tax rate of 30% for fiscal 2025.

lululemon expects a capital expenditure of $740-$760 million for fiscal 2025. As part of the Power of Three X2 growth plan, LULU estimates net revenues of $12.5 billion by 2026, implying significant growth from the 2021 reported figure of $6.25 billion.

Part of the Starbucks revamp goes beyond just reduced wait times.","Starbucks is on a mission to rebuild its coffeehouse culture and improve customer service. The latest enhancement involves shortening wait times for orders. After numerous reports last year about wait times exceeding 30 minutes, Starbucks’ new target is getting an order out in four minutes or less.

The four-minute goal is for orders both in-store and in the Starbucks drive-thru. For mobile and delivery orders, baristas should aim for a maximum of 12 minutes. “Really quick” fresh coffee is the goal, according to CEO Brian Niccol.

In all of its history, this is the first time Starbucks has set time goals across the company. Starbucks has not released official data stating what the average wait time is currently.

Designed to reduce drink-making complexity, increase delivery rates, and provide better customer communication, Starbucks’ Siren Craft System will help baristas meet the four-minute goal even during busy hours. The coffee retailer even brought in tech firm Empower Delivery to help stores with software updates and equipment improvements to boost performance.

The Starbucks Comeback

For the past few years, Starbucks witnessed a decline in sales and customer satisfaction. Long lines and operational inefficiency plagued the chain. To address various issues, Niccol began looking at ways to “get back to basics” and revitalize its once-held image of a premium coffeehouse.

“We’ve made it harder to be a customer than it should be,” Niccol noted late last year, per Quartz.

Part of the Starbucks revamp goes beyond just reduced wait times. The coffee giant cut its menu by 30%, essentially eliminating complicated, unpopular beverages. Ceramic mugs, condiment stations, and more comfortable seating are also coming to Starbucks locations. Vegan-friendly menu items are being added, and the upcharge for dairy-free alternatives is going away.

The company overhaul also included laying off corporate workers and closing multiple locations. In addition, many unfilled job positions were simply eliminated.

Starbucks also reversed its “open-door” policy this year. The controversial rule, which was implemented in 2018, allowed someone to enter and loiter inside a Starbucks location without buying anything. The rule led to several problems, including reported violent incidents involving both patrons and employees.",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Starbucks-Mobile-Ordering-1024x689.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 16:03:18.555927

It has beaten out Starbucks, which has had a dire year. Complaints of high prices and long wait times have seen millions of customers flee.

In January, it reported sales fell again in between October and December - the fourth straight quarterly drop. Customers fed up with high prices and long wait times ditched the chain.

And it could get worse for Starbucks with the imminent arrival in the US of a rapidly-expanding Chinese competitor. Luckin Coffee — which has overtaken Starbucks as China’s largest coffee chain — is brewing up plans to bring $2 coffee to America.

Starbucks had been the top of Brand Finance's annual study for eight consecutive years before dropping to two in 2025.

McDonald's brand value jumped 7 percent to $40.5 billion. Starbucks' 36 percent decline to $38.8 billion was partially because of its 'growing dissatisfaction among customers.'

The coffee chain also 'dented consumer trust' after being the target of a high-profile boycott campaign related to the conflict in Gaza.

Starbucks' new CEO Brian Niccol is trying to turn things around. He said the company needed to 'fundamentally change' its business approach, including axing multiple drinks from menus and laying off more than 1,000 employees.

McDonald's is currently one of the most popular fast-food chains in the world, with over 43,000 restaurants worldwide.

It continues to add new and fan-favorite items back onto its menus to keep up with competition from other restaurant brands.

One of its talked-about additions is the 'McValue' platform, which includes the $5 Meal Deal and Buy One, Add One for $1 specials.

An offering that will be returning this year is the fan-favorite snack wrap, now known as the McCrispy Wrap.

Brand Finance found that McDonald's received a perfect score in brand 'familiarity' and top scores in 'consideration' and preference, reinforcing its leadership in the sector.

'McDonald's reliably delivers a consistent, efficient product, ensuring customers know what to expect,' the report read.

'This strategy has kept McDonald's ahead of consumer trends while ensuring fast-rate production.'

Although McDonald's reported a slight increase in its US comparable sales in its 2024 revenue compared to last year's amount, Brand Finance concluded that its rising menu prices may play a role in its 7.5 out of 10 price premium acceptance score.

While Starbucks operates over 35,000 restaurants, the chain experienced four consecutive quarters of sales declines.

'These declines reflect deeper issues for Starbucks, including a misalignment with customer expectations,' the report read regarding its Brand Strength Index (BSI) decrease.

'Starbucks' heavy focus on app-based sales has drawn criticism from loyal customers who value the brand's traditional coffeehouse experience.'

Like McDonald's, another factor contributing to sales declines is the rise in product prices.

The coffee chain has been working to escape its sales slump through a Back to Starbucks Strategy implemented by CEO Brian Niccol.

The brand is looking to focus more on its 'core strengths' with hopes of boosting profits worldwide.

'While we're only one quarter into our turnaround, we're moving quickly to act on the 'Back to Starbucks' efforts and we've seen a positive response,' Niccol said.

'We believe this is the fundamental change in strategy needed to solve our underlying issues, restore confidence in our brand and return the business to sustainable, long-term growth.'

One brand that also experienced significant value growth is KFC, which Brand Finance ranked at number three.

It surpassed 30,000 operating restaurants last year and experienced an eight percent value increase to $15.4 billion.

Subway upped last year's value by 12 percent and retained its number four position with $8.1 billion in value.

Although Taco Bell's value decreased by three percent to $6.9 billion, like the sandwich chain, its ranking did not change.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/17/96683547-0-image-m-48_1743182710262.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 17:04:55.992498

Starbucks is on a mission to speed up its act, setting new goals to cut wait times for both drive-thru and mobile orders in an effort to win back customers and boost sales.

Following reports of 30 to 40-minute waits last year, the coffee giant is now aiming to complete drive-thru orders in four minutes, while mobile orders should be ready within 12 minutes, according to an internal training document obtained by Bloomberg. Starbucks (SBUX-1.58%) did not immediately respond to Quartz’s request for comment on whether this goal would increase the workload for baristas. The company has said it plans to hire more workers to address staffing issues, which have left many locations operating with “skeleton” crews.

These new targets are part of Starbucks’ attempt at a Big Fix, which looks to restore the brand’s position as a premium coffeehouse. After four consecutive quarters of declining sales and growing frustration over long wait times, the company is focusing on speed. CEO Brian Niccol, who took over in Sept. 2024, has previously stated that Starbucks would make fresh-brewed coffee in under four minutes. These goals mark the first time the company has formally implemented such specific targets, per Bloomberg. Starbucks also recently announced it would limit mobile orders to a maximum of 12 items per customer.

To cut waits, Niccol is leaning on the company’s “Siren Craft System,” which it designed to speed up drink-making and customer interactions — including by pulling espresso before steaming milk instead of after. The company has also partnered with a tech firm to help meet the four-minute target while enhancing in-store operations.

The transition to Saham ownership was executed smoothly, ensuring service quality remained unaffected. A well-managed separation from the French group allowed for a seamless shift in operations.

CEO Daniel Ervér admits the group is dealing with negative ‘external factors’, higher discounts and investments in the customer proposition. The gross margin was also under pressure due to currency effects: the Swedish krona gained in value, resulting in less favourable conversion.

The number of physical stores fell by 125 locations in one year to 4,213. In the first quarter, the group closed a net 40 stores.

Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2024 Financial Results

In February 2025, the Company adopted a restructuring plan to extend its capital resources in connection with initiating a process to evaluate strategic alternatives. As part of the restructuring plan, the Company’s board of directors approved a reduction of approximately 30% of the Company’s global workforce to better align resources with the Company’s focus on the evaluation of strategic options and the Phase 1 study for LAVA-1266. The Company expects approximately $1.0 million of expenses related to the restructuring to be incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2025, of which approximately $0.3 million of cash payments are expected to be made during 2025.

As of December 31, 2024, LAVA had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $76.6 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $95.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Company believes its current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund operations into 2027.

Revenue from contracts with customers was $5.0 million and $0.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $12.0 million and $6.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to the $5.0 million milestone related to J&J’s IND filing in October 2024. The increase in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily related to $7.0 million the Company recognized in revenue in connection with its agreement with Pfizer related to the achievement of a clinical development milestone and $5.0 million the Company recognized as revenue in connection with J&J’s IND filing. In comparison, in 2023, revenue included $4.3 million related to the Company’s agreement with Pfizer and $2.5 million related to the Company’s agreement with J&J.

Cost of sales of goods and providing services was zero and $0.2 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and zero and $3.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cost in 2023 was due to the initial drug supply delivery to Pfizer and related stability studies.

Research and development expenses were $8.6 million and $2.3 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $28.5 million and $32.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to costs associated with the discontinuation of LAVA-1207, announced in December 2024. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to reduced manufacturing scale-up costs and headcount reductions that occurred in the second half of 2023, offset by costs associated with the discontinuation of LAVA-1207.

General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for each of the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and $13.2 million and $14.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily due to lower share-based compensation expense as a result of fewer options issued and a reduction in the Company’s share price.

Net loss was $3.8 million and $6.4 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or $0.14 and $0.24 net loss per share for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net losses were $25.1 million and $41.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, or $0.94 and $1.57 net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Sales growth was also knocked by H&M’s plans to trim its store estate and help simplify its operations over the past year.

H&M said it had 40 net store closures over the quarter, including 35 for the eponymous H&M brand while it also closed five Monki shops.

Its recent store overhaul left the retailer with 4,213 stores at the end of last month – a reduction of 125 over the past year.

The group, which also owns the Cos and & Other Stories brands, reported that gross profit for the quarter dipped slightly to £27.2 billion from £27.7 billion.

Daniel Erver, chief executive of the business, said: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.

“We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.”",https://static.standard.co.uk/2025/03/27/13/e0e080c3ddd72d53925f53b40c0e56e5Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzQzMTY1NDU2-2.53258082.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75,N,,2025-03-28 13:07:35.866839

The member-owned insurer's $3.3 billion acquisition of Cigna's Medicare Advantage, Part D and Medigap assets this month transformed Health Care Service Corp. into a national carrier. The company is bullish on Medicare Advantage, despite persistent headwinds. But the deal also reflects the continuing aftershocks of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's historic settlements in a pair of antitrust lawsuits.

Related: Right place, wrong time: BCBS insurers report Medicare gains

To be sure, Health Care Service Corp. is not vying to become a healthcare conglomerate like UnitedHealth Group, CVS Health and Cigna that competes nationwide in the employer, individual, Medicare and Medicaid markets.

Health Care Service Corp. has no near-term plans to go beyond Medicare in the states it accessed through the Cigna deal and has no major acquisitions on the horizon, said Arun Prasad, executive vice president and chief strategy officer and president of diversified businesses.

But the insurer was no slouch even before taking on Cigna's Medicare business. Health Care Service Corp. has 26.5 million members and is the largest nonprofit and the largest member-owned health insurance company. But a greatly expanded Medicare presence elevates its standing.

Health Care Service Corp. was limited to selling Blue Cross and Blue Shield policies, including Medicare Advantage plans, in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas before the deal.

After the Cigna acquisition, Health Care Service Corp. has a much bigger footprint and can offer Medicare Advantage in 25 more states and the District of Columbia, Part D nationally, and Medigap in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The insurer now counts 830,000 Medicare Advantage members, about four times as many as prior to the Cigna purchase.

“Medicare Advantage is here to stay and is going to be a program that will be fairly attractive,” Prasad said.

Moving up a weight class means facing dominant for-profit Medicare Advantage carriers such as UnitedHealth Group subsidiary UnitedHealthcare, Humana and CVS Health subsidiary Aetna head on. Those three insurers collectively cover 57% of Medicare Advantage enrollees, according to an analysis of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data the investment bank Stephens published in February.

Health Care Service Corp. is making a big bet on Medicare Advantage at a fraught moment when other companies are trying to reduce their exposure in this market. Medicare Advantage insurers continue to brace against rising medical costs, tightened federal purse strings and stricter regulatory enforcement.

Insurers and investors are hopeful, however, that the difficult season is waning as costs stabilize, and anticipate that President Donald Trump's administration will treat Medicare Advantage more favorably than President Joe Biden's did. Moreover, Health Care Service Corp. sees great potential in the program as the population continues to age.

“If you're looking at it over the next six to 12 months, there is some volatility,” Prasad said. “If you look over a longer period of time, it's not difficult at all.”

Duane Wright, senior research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, agreed. “They’re coming into this on the upswing,” he said.

Blues business evolving

Health Care Service Corp.'s Medicare Advantage expansion also aligns with a broader shakeup in the Blue Cross and Blue Shield system.

Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, for example, have undertaken corporate restructurings in the past two years as they seek scale and diversification to compete with for-profit insurers.

A lengthy, and still incompletely resolved, legal challenge to fundamental aspects of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield model may be a big part of why Health Care Service Corp. and its peers are in the midst of an evolution.

Providers and plan sponsors such as employers initiated lawsuits against the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association in 2012, alleging a multitude of anticompetitive practices. While these cases wended their way through the courts and under the terms of the deals themselves, the association made key concessions.

Crucially, prior to agreeing to terms with the plan sponsors and insurers in 2022, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association scrapped a longstanding rule that limited how much Blue Cross and Blue Shield carriers can earn from non-Blues-branded businesses.

That likely made the Health Care Service Corp.-Cigna deal possible, said Doug Wolfe, co-founder and managing partner of the law firm Wolfe Pincavage, which represents hospitals in payment disputes against insurers. “Could this have happened without the Blue Cross Blue Shield settlement? The answer to that is probably no,” he said.

Under construction

The Medicare plans Health Care Service Corp. bought will carry Cigna branding for the rest of the year, after which the company will come up with something new, Prasad said.

But Health Care Service Corp. won't be able to put the Blue Cross and Blue Shield label on its Medicare policies outside of Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas because other companies have the necessary Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association licenses in the newly acquired states.

“HCSC — let's face it: It's a mouthful. It's not a very consumer-friendly name, and they have to be consumer-friendly to compete in the MA space,” said Stephen Parente, a healthcare economist at the University of Minnesota Carlson School of Management.

Health Care Service Corp. also confronts critical logistical challenges, starting with assembling provider networks in its new markets where it does not have access to the shared national Blue Cross and Blue Shield network. The company could, however, acquire or contract with other Blues plans, said Ari Gottlieb, an independent healthcare consultant.

Building a network won't necessarily be easy in the current environment, when providers are intensely displeased with Medicare Advantage carriers over reimbursements, claims processing, prior authorizations and other matters, and many are simply opting out. “Providers now more so have the leverage in this market,” said Neil Patil, health policy director at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy.

Cigna, which owns the pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts, will continue administering drug coverage for its former plans for four years, according to the companies. Cigna will maintain oversight of reinsurance and administrative services for an undetermined period of time, the insurers notified California regulators in August.

Spending $3.3 billion on new assets also squeezed Health Care Service Corp.'s already troubled finances.

Health Care Service Corp.'s underwriting losses more than doubled to $792.2 million last year, according to an analysis of regulatory filings the market research firm Mark Farrah Associates performed for Modern Healthcare.

The insurer borrowed $2.5 billion of the money it paid Cigna, prompting S&P Global Ratings to downgrade its credit from AA- to A+ after the deal closed this month.

Private equity firms Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management will purchase Family Dollar, the companies announced Wednesday; Dollar Tree estimated about $804 million in net proceeds from the sale, which it expects to close by June 2025.

Dollar Tree, which acquired Family Dollar in 2015 for about $9 billion, began considering a sale or spinoff of Family Dollar in June 2024 as a way to restructure the company amid a challenging retail climate with inflation and competition from big-box retailers such as Walmart and online retailers including Amazon, Shein and Temu.

Dollar Tree closed about 600 Family Dollar stores in 2024 and had plans to close another 370 – along with 30 Dollar Tree stores – when the leases came up on on those locations.

CEO Michael Creedon, who moved from chief operating officer to interim CEO and then CEO during Dollar Tree's restructuring in recent months, said the separation from Family Dollar puts Dollar Tree in position to ""achieve its full potential,"" in a call with investment analysts Wednesday.

“We will continue to grow and optimize our Dollar Tree business to maximize value for Dollar Tree associates, customers, and shareholders with an enhanced focus on compelling initiatives, including our expanded assortment, significant planned new store openings across the United States, and transactions that advance our growth strategy,"" Creedon said in a press release announcing the Family Dollar sale.

Dollar Tree adding, upgrading stores

Dollar Tree, which has 2,900 Dollar Tree stores after opening 525 during the past year, expects to open about 300 new stores in 2025, Creedon said. The discount retailer is also upgrading stores to handle items priced as high as $7. Among stores being upgraded are some among the 170 leases of 99 Cents Only Stores in Arizona, California, Nevada, and Texas acquired in May 2024.

About 1,000 combination Family Dollar-Dollar Tree stores will be sold in the deal.

Dollar Tree reported net sales of $5 billion – excluding sales from Family Dollar stores – a 2% increase in same-store sales during the three-month period ending Feb. 1, 2025. Store traffic in Dollar Tree stores rose 0.7% and shoppers spent 1.3% more per total purchase.

Total fourth quarter sales including from Family Dollar were $8.26 billion, which surpassed the $8.23 billion estimated by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Dollar Tree CEO on higher-income shoppers: 'Everybody's hurting'

Traditionally, middle-income shoppers account for about half of Dollar Tree customers, Creedon said. However, increased traffic and sales is being driven in part by ""stronger demand from higher-income customers who increasingly see Dollar Tree as a cost-effective source for an expanding range of products,"" he said.

Lower-income customers ""need us particularly to make their wallet go farther, in between paychecks,"" Creedon said. But during ""this inflationary environment, all shoppers across all income cohorts, including the higher income, is finding Dollar Tree as part of their solution,"" he said. ""It doesn't matter how much money you make everybody's hurting right now.""

Tariffs could lead to some higher prices at Dollar Tree

Dollar Tree had ""mitigated"" the effects of the first round of tariffs levied on products from China by about 90%, through negotiations, changing product specifications and buying from suppliers in different countries.

But higher prices could be an option depending on how future tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada play out, Creedon said. For instance, he said, ""we're the best in the nation for prayer candles. They're made in Mexico and so we want to make sure we can still offer them. So we will look at targeted pricing on things like that.""

Dollar Tree's break with Family Dollar marks the end of a costly merger it hoped would bolster it against competitors such as Dollar General, which also bid on Family Dollar at the time.

Family Dollar stores had also been hit with some issues over the past two years including a 2023 recall of products including toothpaste, pain relievers and other over-the-counter medicines that had been stored improperly, but were shipped to stores.

In 2024, Family Dollar agreed to pay the Justice Department $41.6 million for storing food, cosmetics, drugs and medical devices in a rat-infested warehouse in Arkansas for several years, court records show.

""It is truly 'addition by subtraction' as Family Dollar had been a consistent weight on topline performance, margin rate, and management time,"" Evercore analyst Michael Montani told Reuters.

Dollar Tree shares, which had been down 11% so far this year, were up more than 9% in early trading Wednesday.

Flash PMI data to provide steer on geopolitical economic impact

Markets will be busy in the coming week assessing new tariff announcements from the US as well as worldwide PMI survey data covering both manufacturing and services, as well as the monthly US jobs report.

The major news event of the week is scheduled for 2 April, which will see the US outline the tariffs it will impose on trading partners in addition to those already announced. While President Donald Trump's so-called 'Liberation Day' is expected see a significant increase in the overall tariff burden, many are hoping that it will at least add some clarity to the US administration's trade policy to help business planning and forecasting. Insights into the degree to which trading partners respond will also be eagerly awaited.

In terms of economic data, the worldwide PMI surveys will give up-to-date feedback from businesses about the impact of recent developments. As well as updates to actual business levels, including output, employment and pricing, a key area of interest will be business confidence via the PMI's forward-looking business expectations indices.

A review of the preliminary 'flash' PMI data from the US, Europe and Japan is available here. While these early surveys showed output growth ticking higher across the major developed economies in March, growth was uneven and has remained modest so far this year. Business sentiment about prospects has meanwhile sunk to its lowest since late 2022.

The final global PMI data will add colour in particular via the extension of survey coverage to mainland China, Canada, Mexico and other key APAC economies, as well as the sector details. February, for example, saw the global autos and parts sector already contracting sharply, even before new 25% tariffs had been announced by the US, bucking a broader manufacturing upturn.

The week will by no means get less exciting as it goes on, however, as Friday is non-farm payroll day. February's payroll count disappointed with a 151k rise, and some government job cuts could depress March's reading. But we note that private sector payrolls rose by just 110k on average in the first two months of 2025, with the PMI data available so far pointing to a further sluggish rise in March. The unemployment rate meanwhile edged up from 4.0% to 4.1% in February and wage growth ticked up from 3.9% to 4.0%.

What to watch in the coming week

Worldwide manufacturing and services PMI

Global manufacturing PMI will be updated on 1 April, while services and composite numbers will be due 3 April. Additionally to the national PMIs, detailed sector data will provide insights into the key drivers of changes to economic conditions. Growth, confidence and inflation metrics will be closely watched after developed economies' flash PMI revealed opposing trends in March.

Americas: US labour market report, ISM PMI, plus trade data; Canada trade and employment figures

March US non-farm payrolls, wages and unemployment data will be released on Friday for official signals of labour market conditions after US Flash PMI revealed that employment returned to growth after falling in February. Final S&P Global PMI figures will also be due alongside the ISM readings for assessment growth and inflation trends at the end of the first quarter of the year. This comes after the flash data indicated a notable impact of tariffs on US goods prices in March.

Separately, Canada will also publish trade and employment figures, with trade uncertainty reported to have negatively affected production in Canada via February's PMI.

EMEA: Eurozone inflation; Germany factory orders and retail sales; UK mortgage data and housing prices

In addition to final PMI readings (including construction PMIs), the key data to watch in Europe will be eurozone inflation. According to flash figures, the PMI's main selling price index declined in March to a level broadly consistent with inflation running close to the ECB's target. If confirmed, markets will see increased scope for the ECB to lower rates further as insurance against downside risks to growth caused by tariff worries.

Germany factory orders and retail sales data will also be due with more up-to-date March HCOB Flash Germany PMI showing growth to have been buoyed by an upturn in manufacturing production.

APAC: RBA meeting, Australia trade; China NBS PMI; Japan Tankan survey, industrial production, retail sales

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) convenes for their April policy meeting with the possibility of a rate cut not entirely ruled out according to latest market views. March's S&P Global Flash Australia PMI showed business activity growth at a seven-month high while inflation eased, providing little impetus for an imminent move.

On the data release front, besides the series of March APAC PMI releases, the focus will be with PMI figures from mainland China's National Bureau of Statistics and Japan's Tankan survey.

Ervér told analysts that H&M had begun to shift its supply chain to adapt to new trade tariffs.
H&M was founded in 1947 under the name Hennes.
Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC, said: “We think H&M has taken various steps to improve its offer for customers which should lead to a stronger sales performance in time.","“We are still in a high-inflation climate where the customers’ spending power is limited, so we stay very focused on providing outstanding value for money.”

Ervér, who has led H&M since February last year, has continued with a cost-cutting plan in a bid to improve profit margins at the group. He has also boosted the company’s spending on marketing, with the singers FKA Twigs and Tyla promoting H&M’s recent lines as it attempts to win back customers amid tough competition.

H&M said sales in March had risen by 1 per cent as it reported a sluggish start to its spring/summer season.

The fashion group, which also owns brands including Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, experienced a rise in discounting due to Black Friday — the day in November when retailers offer deep discounts — falling later in the year. The timing of the sales period also resulted in an increase in logistics costs.

Ervér told analysts that H&M had begun to shift its supply chain to adapt to new trade tariffs. The United States is the group’s second largest market by sales. “We feel at the end of the day, it will come at the cost of the consumer,” Ervér said. He added that the company would be likely to have to increase prices to alleviate the impact of tariffs.

H&M was founded in 1947 under the name Hennes. For more than a decade it has grappled with weak profitability while struggling to keep pace with Inditex, the Spanish fashion giant that owns Zara, and which in recent years has been able to pass on inflated costs to its less price-sensitive shoppers.

The Swedish company has also experienced tough competition due to the rise of fast-fashion newcomers including Shein and Temu.

Richard Chamberlain, an analyst at RBC, said: “We think H&M has taken various steps to improve its offer for customers which should lead to a stronger sales performance in time. However, a lot of things have to improve together and so far the recovery has been somewhat unbalanced, in our view.”

Management Commentary

“We are encouraged by the meaningful progress we made in 2024 as we implemented significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet, streamline operations, and drive efficiencies,” said Norman E. Snyder, Jr., CEO of Reed’s. “During the fourth quarter, we closed a $10 million private placement, in addition to the incremental capital, we sourced a new demand note, and completed the convertible debt restructuring during the third quarter, providing the necessary capital to invest in inventory, personnel, marketing, strategic partnerships, and international expansion — all of which we believe will position Reed’s for accelerated growth and profitability. We also increased retail penetration during the quarter, securing notable distribution gains across Kroger, Albertsons/Safeway, Harris Teeter, Stop and Shop, Giant Eagle, and Costco for multiple products, including Reed’s Ginger Ale, Virgil’s Root Beer and Vanilla Cream Cans.

“Subsequent to year-end, we welcomed Douglas W. McCurdy as our new CFO. Doug brings extensive finance, operational and leadership experience to our team. We also appointed Salvatore Vassallo, a seasoned consumer packaged goods and supply chain executive, as our new Vice President of Operations. We believe their combined leadership in finance, supply chain and operations will help drive both efficiency and scalability at Reed’s.

“Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy with a solid foundation and strengthened balance sheet. This year we are expanding our product portfolio with the launch of our new multi-functional beverage line, expected to hit shelves in April. We have already secured over 8,000 points of distribution across key retailers nationwide. With a de-leveraged balance sheet, improved financial flexibility, and growing retail momentum, we believe we are well positioned to deliver meaningful growth and profitability in 2025.”

Modified EBITDA

In addition to our GAAP results, we present Modified EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance. However, Modified EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, income from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We define Modified EBITDA as net income (loss), plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, changes in fair value of warrant expense, change in fair value of SAFE agreements, contract proceedings and insurance settlements, non-recurring professional fees, inventory write-offs associated with exited categories and major packaging and formula changes, one-time changes in policy, impact of changes to accounting methodology and one-time restructuring-related costs including employee severance and asset impairment.

Management considers our core operating performance to be that which our managers can affect in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations during that period. Non-GAAP adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with GAAP are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Modified EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Modified EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

Set forth below is a reconciliation of net loss to Modified EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 (unaudited; in thousands):

We present Modified EBITDA because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use Modified EBITDA in developing our internal budgets, forecasts, and strategic plan; in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions; making compensation decisions; and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance. Modified EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, which includes, among others, the following:

Modified EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

Modified EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

Modified EBITDA does not reflect future interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts; and

Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Modified EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.",https://static.stocktitan.net/company-logo/reed-lg.png,N,,2025-03-27 22:01:03.781749

Despite the complexity of the transformation underway, Société Générale Maroc reported solid commercial performance.
In terms of financial stability, Société Générale Maroc continues to rank among the most resilient players in the market.
With the Saham Group now at the helm, Société Générale Maroc has entered a new phase of development.
Emerging from a demanding year, Société Générale Maroc is stronger, more focused, and better equipped to move forward.","The year 2024 will be remembered as a defining chapter in the trajectory of Société Générale Maroc. A shift in majority ownership, internal restructuring, and exceptional one-off impacts could have destabilized operations. Instead, the bank demonstrated a remarkable ability to steer through change while preserving performance, continuity, and client trust.

The acquisition of Société Générale Group’s stake by the Saham Group was not merely a change in shareholders—it marked the beginning of a strategic realignment. This transition, carefully orchestrated and executed in line with a clear roadmap, enabled the progressive disengagement from legacy systems without disrupting services. On March 25, the Supervisory Board, chaired by Moulay Hafid Elalamy, reviewed the 2024 financial statements, underlining the controlled nature of this transition and the bank’s capacity to evolve without compromising its operational integrity.

Despite the complexity of the transformation underway, Société Générale Maroc reported solid commercial performance. Deposits showed a strong upward trend, and credit portfolios continued to grow. The consolidated Net Banking Income also posted a healthy year-on-year increase, reflecting the enduring trust of clients and the effectiveness of the bank’s commercial model, even in a time of institutional change.

Financial results were affected by two non-recurring items: a provision linked to an internal empowerment program and a tax inspection. These exceptional events weighed on the consolidated net income, which decreased compared to 2023. However, excluding these one-off effects, the bank’s core performance remains robust. The adjusted net income would have exceeded MAD 1.2 billion, demonstrating the institution’s strong underlying profitability and prudent management.

In terms of financial stability, Société Générale Maroc continues to rank among the most resilient players in the market. With total equity exceeding MAD 15.5 billion, a solvency ratio of 14.61%, and a Core Tier 1 ratio of 13.86%, the bank significantly surpasses regulatory requirements. These sound fundamentals are not just technical indicators—they are tangible proof of strength, reliability, and the ability to absorb shocks while continuing to support clients and the economy.

More than a financial milestone, 2024 represents a strategic inflection point. With the Saham Group now at the helm, Société Générale Maroc has entered a new phase of development. Its ambitions are no longer defined by scale alone, but by operational excellence, relational agility, and the ability to deliver high-value services in an evolving economic landscape. This repositioning reflects a deliberate choice: to be a bank that grows through efficiency, innovation, and a renewed commitment to client-centricity.

Emerging from a demanding year, Société Générale Maroc is stronger, more focused, and better equipped to move forward. This is not just a transition—it is a transformation, carried out with discipline, driven by vision, and grounded in long-term resilience.",https://en.7news.ma/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Societe-Generale-maroc.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 22:01:15.291070

(ELV) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","Harrow (HROW) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.25 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.11 per share. This compares to loss of $0.27 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 127.27%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this pharmaceutical and drug compounding company would post a loss of $0.05 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.12, delivering a surprise of -140%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.

Harrow , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Drugs industry, posted revenues of $66.83 million for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $36.36 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.

The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.

Harrow shares have lost about 17.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -2.9%.

What's Next for Harrow?

While Harrow has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?

There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.

Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.

Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Harrow: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.10 on $64.33 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.54 on $294.58 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Drugs is currently in the top 31% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Another stock from the broader Zacks Medical sector, Elevance Health (ELV), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2025.

This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $10.60 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.4%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.

Elevance Health's revenues are expected to be $45.74 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.

The Future of Walgreens in the United States Despite the decision to close hundreds of stores, Walgreens remains one of the leading pharmacy chains in the United States.","Amid a difficult economic situation, Walgreens has confirmed that it will close 500 of its stores in the United States during 2025. This announcement is part of a broader plan to reduce the number of locations of the chain, which plans to close 1,200 stores in total over the coming years. This decision not only reflects Walgreens's struggle but also a worrying upward trend in the face of the economic challenges facing retail in the United States.

The Impact of the Closures on Walgreens

Walgreens has admitted that a quarter of its 8,700 stores in the United States are not profitable. Despite having exceeded Wall Street's expectations regarding its earnings, the company has not been able to avoid the problems plaguing the industry. Rising costs and competition from online retailers have severely affected its profitability.

Tim Wentworth, CEO of Walgreens, explained that the company is in the middle of a ""turnaround"" and that this process ""will take time."" Despite the closures, Wentworth was optimistic about the future, assuring that the measures taken will bring both financial and consumer benefits in the long term.

The Struggle to Stay Afloat

Walgreens's business model has been especially hit by the reduction in prescription reimbursements and growing competition. Additionally, many consumers have moved away from traditional pharmacies, seeking lower prices elsewhere. Although Walgreens led vaccinations during the Covid-19 pandemic, the boost that gave them has already disappeared and the company faces a tough battle to remain relevant.

The company is not the only one going through this type of crisis: its competitor, CVS, has also closed several stores. Rite Aid, another major chain, emerged from bankruptcy with a reduced presence of 1,300 stores. However, despite these challenges, Wentworth was confident that Walgreens can overcome this situation.

The Future of Walgreens in the United States

Despite the decision to close hundreds of stores, Walgreens remains one of the leading pharmacy chains in the United States. The company still owns around 6,000 profitable stores, which will serve as a base to continue operating and rebuild its image. Wentworth highlighted that this solid base will allow Walgreens to invest in the future and adapt its business model to new market demands.

The closures, which will begin to be implemented in 2025, are part of a broader strategy to restructure the company. Walgreens, like other large chains, faces a challenging landscape in an increasingly competitive market. It is possible that, after what happened in 2019 with the pandemic, this type of establishment has lost the trust of a percentage of consumers.",https://e-noticies.cat/filesedc/uploads/image/post/montaje-interior-walgreens-desenfocado-estados-unidos-persona-sorprendida_1200_800.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 03:59:15.101562

Management Commentary

""We are encouraged by the meaningful progress we made in 2024 as we implemented significant steps to strengthen our balance sheet, streamline operations, and drive efficiencies,” said Norman E. Snyder, Jr., CEO of Reed's. ""During the fourth quarter, we closed a $10 million private placement, in addition to the incremental capital, we sourced a new demand note, and completed the convertible debt restructuring during the third quarter, providing the necessary capital to invest in inventory, personnel, marketing, strategic partnerships, and international expansion - all of which we believe will position Reed's for accelerated growth and profitability. We also increased retail penetration during the quarter, securing notable distribution gains across Kroger, Albertsons/Safeway, Harris Teeter, Stop and Shop, Giant Eagle, and Costco for multiple products, including Reed's Ginger Ale, Virgil's Root Beer and Vanilla Cream Cans.

""Subsequent to year-end, we welcomed Douglas W. McCurdy as our new CFO. Doug brings extensive finance, operational and leadership experience to our team. We also appointed Salvatore Vassallo, a seasoned consumer packaged goods and supply chain executive, as our new Vice President of Operations. We believe their combined leadership in finance, supply chain and operations will help drive both efficiency and scalability at Reed's.

""Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy with a solid foundation and strengthened balance sheet. This year we are expanding our product portfolio with the launch of our new multi-functional beverage line, expected to hit shelves in April. We have already secured over 8,000 points of distribution across key retailers nationwide. With a de-leveraged balance sheet, improved financial flexibility, and growing retail momentum, we believe we are well positioned to deliver meaningful growth and profitability in 2025.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 Financial Results

During the fourth quarter of 2024, net sales were $9.7 million compared to $11.7 million in the year-ago period. This decrease was primarily driven by short order shipments due to prior inventory constraints.

Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2024 increased to $2.9 million compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 30.0% compared to 4.0% in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by one-time charges in the prior-year period, including a $1.8 million non-cash packaging inventory valuation adjustment and a $1.3 million provision for product holds related to the Company's swing-lid program.

Delivery and handling costs were reduced by 10% to $1.7 million during the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Delivery and handling costs were 17% of net sales or $3.00 per case, compared to 16% of net sales or $2.82 per case during the same period last year.

ID1,AB InBev,2025-03-27 23:18:48+00:00,Food & Beverage Industry News,"Beer sector - consumption down, revenue up - Food & Beverage Industry News",Mike Wheeler,,,,,https://www.foodmag.com.au/beer-sector-consumption-down-revenue-up/,"As a result, craft beer sales have outpaced those of regular beer, and independent breweries have gained market share.
Despite a drop in overall beer consumption, higher prices and greater spending per beer have helped maintain revenue levels.
While beer consumption per capita has decreased—from 190 litres per person in 1974-75 to 82 litres per person in 2019-2020—revenue growth has been driven by the increasing demand for craft beer.
In response to this growth in craft beer production and consumption, some State Governments thrown support behind the sector.
The inaugural Western Australian Craft Beer Strategy brings together all parts of the craft beer supply chain to drive forward a unified and sustainable industry.","Australia’s beer manufacturing industry has seen steady growth in recent years, despite a decline in per capita beer consumption, according to the latest research from IBISWorld.

The rise of craft beer has driven much of this growth, with consumers increasingly opting for higher-priced, premium beers over traditional options. As a result, craft beer sales have outpaced those of regular beer, and independent breweries have gained market share. In response, major brewers like Asahi

and Lion have expanded their craft beer portfolios.

Lion’s 2021 acquisition of Fermentum Pty Ltd highlights how larger brewers are leveraging acquisitions to tap into the craft beer boom. IBISWorld’s market research projects the industry’s revenue will reach $8.7 billion by 2025, growing at an annual rate of 0.9 per cent between 2020 and 2025. The revenue growth has been supported by consumers shifting away from full-strength beers like Victoria Bitter and XXXX Gold and opting for more expensive craft beers.

Despite a drop in overall beer consumption, higher prices and greater spending per beer have helped maintain revenue levels.

The beer manufacturing industry in Australia remains concentrated in New South Wales and Victoria, where population density and market demand are highest. However, new breweries face challenges, including securing land, obtaining licenses, and competing for tap and shelf space.

The beer manufacturing industry is expected to continue growing until 2030, although increasing excise taxes may impact profit margins. Australia has the third-highest beer tax in the world, behind only Norway and Finland, which could affect the cost structures of breweries and their pricing strategies.

Traditional full-strength beers, such as Victoria Bitter, Carlton Draught, and XXXX Gold, remain the largest revenue drivers, despite their declining market share. Other categories, including mid-strength, light, and low-carb beers, are also growing, but have not yet surpassed full-strength beers in terms of revenue.

Overall, the industry is projected to be worth $8.7 billion, with competition rising as the number of breweries increases by 8% annually, bringing the total to 878 businesses. While beer consumption per capita has decreased—from 190 litres per person in 1974-75 to 82 litres per person in 2019-2020—revenue growth has been driven by the increasing demand for craft beer.

Despite the rise of craft beer, full-strength beer remains the most popular category, with brands like Victoria Bitter, XXXX Gold, and Carlton Draught still holding large market share. Most breweries are based in New South Wales and Victoria, where the consumer base is largest. The leading brewers by revenue are Asahi Holdings ($3.1 billion), Lion ($1.8 billion), and Coopers Brewery ($187 million).

In response to this growth in craft beer production and consumption, some State Governments thrown support behind the sector. The Western Australia Government has announced a new strategy to grow the state’s craft beer sector, create jobs and promote the industry’s ‘paddock to pint’ tourism experience.

Western Australia is considered the birthplace of Australia’s craft beer sector, with the establishment of a handful of now iconic breweries in Perth in the 1980s and 1990s. The inaugural Western Australian Craft Beer Strategy brings together all parts of the craft beer supply chain to drive forward a unified and sustainable industry.

The industry-led strategy aims to boost production, with the ambitious goal of tripling either the volume or value of locally produced beer over ten years. It also strives to improve supply chain integration, including those that produce homegrown barley, hops and malt, and the local businesses that provide packaging, distribution, and retail services.

There are now more than 120 breweries across the metropolitan area and regional WA, representing 20 per cent of the national industry.

“Our craft beer industry uses premium ingredients grown in the State’s agricultural sector and it’s that unique WA ‘paddock to pint’ experience that an increasing number of customers are drawn to,” said Agriculture and Food Minister Jackie Jarvis.

“It’s also a major draw card for tourists with more than 120 breweries across the State, half of which are in

our regions.

“The inaugural Western Australian Craft Beer Strategy will lay the groundwork for industry, Government and other stakeholders to collaborate and shape the future of the craft beer industry.”

Beer manufacturing contributed an estimated $648 million to the WA economy in 2020-21, directly supporting around 967 full-time jobs and indirectly supporting more than 4,000 jobs across Western Australia

The industry-led strategy was facilitated by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development as a partnering initiative with the Independent Brewers Association, Western Australian Brewers Association and Southwest Brewers Alliance.

The five strategic priorities are industry leadership, brand awareness, market access and export opportunities, supply chain management, and regulation.

Meanwhile, the Australian beer market is considered one of the most restricted globally, with two foreign-owned corporations, Lion (Kirin) and Carlton & United Breweries (Asahi), dominating beer supply. Additionally, two large companies dominate the retail beer sector.

Mergers, acquisitions, and regulatory factors have also shaped the market structure seen today. Market concentration in Australia is notable. As of 2024, publicly available data indicates that Lion holds a 33 per cent market share, CUB commands 50 per cent, major retailers Coles Group and Endeavour Group control five per cent, Coopers (a family-owned independent) holds five per cent, and Good Drinks Australia, an ASX-listed independent, has 1.25 per cent. The remaining 5.75 per cent of the market is shared by various independent breweries.

This independent sector figure is expected to continue to grow. In 2019, AB InBev (then owner of Carlton and United) described the Australian beer market as one of the most profitable worldwide, with a high value per hectolitre consumed.

At that time, AB InBev and Lion Nathan together held over 80 per cent of the market, both in volume and value.

The market was highly consolidated, with strong retailer relationships and modern trade structures giving both companies a competitive advantage.

All in all, the Australian beer manufacturing sector remains high profitable but also highly competitive, with 2025 expected to be another positive year.",http://www.foodmag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Beer-Consumption.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 20:01:47.033927

For 1 December 2024 to 28 February 2025, Gross profit amounted to SEK 27.16 billion (£2 billion), down from SEK 27.65 billion (£2.13 billion). H&M said this was due to ""negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering"".

Operating profit amounted to SEK 1.2 billion (£92 million), down from SEK 2.07 billion (£160 million).

During the period, the company continued to optimise its store portfolio by closing select stores. It went into the quarter with nearly 120 fewer stores compared to the same time last year, and it had 40 net store closures during the period.

Daniel Ervér, CEO at H&M Group, said: ""Operating profit and profitability were impacted by temporarily challenging development of the gross margin. Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this, we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth.

Looking ahead, the H&M group’s sales in the month of March 2025 are expected to increase by 1% in local currencies compared with to the year prior. H&M in particular is set to receive a sales boost from its highly anticipated collaborative collection with Magda Butrym that's set to launch on 24 April.

Ervér continued: ""Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.

""We can see that the improvements we have made, especially in the women’s assortment, are starting to have a positive effect. Here we have simplified the organisation and become faster at adapting to new trends and creating a more relevant assortment.

""Through our omni-model we are continuing to integrate the physical and digital sales channels, making it easier for our customers to find what they are looking for. The upgraded digital store was rolled out to more markets in the quarter and has been well-received by our customers. Upgrades to our physical stores continue to be given high priority. In addition to rebuilding key stores in several major cities, we are expanding customer experience upgrades to more stores in more markets during the year.

""With macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, it is important that we continue to focus fully on our plan and offer the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability for everyone.""",https://www.theindustry.fashion/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/HM-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-28 05:57:54.895807

Outlook for Fiscal Year 2025 Emphasizes Growth in Operating Cash Flow

CHICO, Calif., March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lulu’s Fashion Lounge Holdings, Inc. (“Lulus” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: LVLU) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 29, 2024 and issued its financial outlook for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2025.

Crystal Landsem, CEO of Lulus, said:

“In the fourth quarter, we delivered positive sales growth in our special occasion, bridesmaid, and bridal categories, reinforcing our strength in event dressing despite the seasonally slower sales period. These gains in our occasion dress categories were offset by continued softness in casual wear, which we are actively repositioning to better align with our core focus on event attire. Building on our cost reduction efforts, we successfully completed the consolidation of our West Coast distribution facilities in late February 2025.

We have also expanded our strategic wholesale partnerships to support our focus on meeting customers across diverse shopping channels, while maintaining an efficient, scalable growth model. With continued investment in our brand and diversification of our supply chain and selling channels, optimization of product margin, and a more streamlined cost structure, we believe we can drive a pronounced growth in operating cash flow in 2025.”

Fiscal Year 2024 Highlights:

Net revenue of $315.9 million, an 11% decrease compared to 2023, driven by a 12% decrease in Total Orders Placed and higher return rates offset by a 3% increase in Average Order Value (“AOV”) from $133 to $137, compared to 2023.

Active Customers of 2.6 million, a 7% decrease compared to 2.8 million in 2023.

Gross profit decreased 12% to $130.2 million and Gross Margin decreased 50 basis points to 41.2%, in each case compared to 2023.

Net loss of $55.3 million, compared to net loss of $19.3 million in 2023. Included in this net loss was a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $28.4 million. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, our net loss was $26.9 million.

Adjusted EBITDA* of ($9.7) million, compared to $3.2 million in 2023.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $2.6 million, compared to $15.4 million in 2023.

Free Cash Flow* of ($0.3) million, compared to $11.5 million in 2023.

Total debt and Net Debt* increased by $5.1 million and $3.1 million, respectively, during the fifty-two weeks ended December 29, 2024.

Note: “*” represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics” section below for definitions of these metrics.

Tiffany Smith, CFO of Lulus, said:

“The implementation of our cost reduction plans allowed us to deliver the narrowest quarterly net loss, excluding goodwill impairment, of the past six quarters. Selling, marketing, and general and administrative expenses in Q4 were $5.5 million lower year-over-year, a 15% decline that outpaced our 12% decline in net revenue. To further optimize costs, we consolidated our West Coast distribution facilities, a process which began in late Q4 2024 and was completed in Q1 2025. With major cost reduction initiatives in place, we remain committed to ongoing and disciplined cost management.

Looking ahead, in 2025, we remain focused on strengthening our cash position, returning to profitability, and maintaining healthy inventory turns. Our 2025 net revenue outlook reflects our expectation of continued momentum in special occasion and event wear, tempered by the ongoing repositioning of our casual categories. With a healthy inventory position, we anticipate reduced markdowns and margin expansion. Direct-to-factory initiatives can further bolster our margins in the latter part of 2025, and more significantly in 2026, giving us confidence in our long-term sales and profitability targets.”

Fourth Quarter 2024 Highlights:

Net revenue of $66.1 million, a decrease of 12% compared to $75.0 million in the same period last year, driven by a 12% decrease in Total Orders Placed and a 5% decrease in AOV from $136 to $129, which was offset by improved return rates.

Gross profit decreased 15% to $25.1 million and Gross Margin decreased 120 basis points to 37.9%, in each case compared to the same period last year.

Net loss of $31.9 million, compared to net loss of $7.2 million in the same period last year. Included in this net loss was a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $28.4 million. Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge, our net loss was $3.5 million.

Adjusted EBITDA* of ($3.3) million, compared to ($2.0) million in the same period last year.

Net cash used in operating activities of $2.5 million, improved from $5.7 million in the same period last year.

Free Cash Flow* of ($3.0) million, improved from ($6.7) million in the same period last year.

Note: “*” represents a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics” section below for definitions of these metrics.

Financial Outlook for Fiscal Year 2025:

We expect net revenue to be between $280 million and $310 million, which represents a decrease of between 11% and 2% compared to 2024.

We expect Adjusted EBITDA to be between $0 and $6 million, which represents an increase of between $9.7 million and $15.7 million compared to 2024.

We expect capital expenditures to be between $2.5 million and $3.0 million, which represents a decrease of 13% or approximately flat compared to 2024.

We expect our Net Debt position for the first quarter of 2025 to be between $3 million and $4 million, and we expect to be operating cash flow positive in 2025, including in the first quarter of 2025.

Forecasting future results or trends is inherently difficult for any business, and actual results or trends may differ materially from those forecasted. Lulus’ outlook is based on current indications for its business. Lulus’ outlook factors in our current best estimates for anticipated headwinds, including those related to the level of demand, spending and returns by our customers, macroeconomic uncertainties, inflation, supply chain pressures, shipping costs, and the intended impact of cost-reduction measures. Given the volatile nature of current consumer demand and potential for further impacts to consumer behavior due to macroeconomic factors, including continued inflation, higher interest rates, student loan repayment resumption, global political changes, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, tariffs or bans, existing and future laws, regulations, and directives (including executive orders), as well as other world events, wars, and domestic and international conflicts that affect overall consumer confidence and the predictability of consumer purchasing behavior, Lulus’ financial outlook is subject to change.

All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this press release are forward-looking statements, including but not limited to statements regarding our opportunities for growth and a return to profitability in the coming quarters, the long-term growth trajectory of our business, the intended impact of cost-reduction measures and our financial outlook for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2025. These statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause Lulus’ actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2024, Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in Lulus’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release. Any such forward-looking statements represent management’s estimates as of the date of this press release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Operating Metrics

To supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we reference in this press release and the accompanying tables the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Free Cash Flow. The presentation of this non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses that may not be indicative of our ongoing core operating performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and other operating metrics are presented below. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net (loss) income on a forward-looking basis cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts, as we are unable to provide reconciling information with respect to equity-based compensation expense and income tax, all of which are adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA. We also use certain key operating metrics, including Gross Margin, Active Customers, Average Order Value, and Total Orders Placed.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net loss before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted to exclude the effects of equity-based compensation and goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis and, in the case of exclusion of the impact of equity-based compensation and goodwill impairment, excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our core operating performance.

Adjusted EBITDA Margin

Adjusted EBITDA Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined above) as a percentage of our net revenue.

Active Customers

We define Active Customers as the number of customers who have made at least one purchase across our platform in the prior 12-month period. Active Customer count is measured as of the last day of the relevant period. We consider the number of Active Customers to be a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to consumer awareness of our brand, our ability to attract visitors to our digital platform, and our ability to convert visitors to paying customers. Active Customer counts are based on de-duplication logic using customer account and guest checkout name, address, and email information.

Average Order Value

We define AOV as the sum of the total gross sales before returns across our platform in a given period, plus shipping revenue, less discounts and markdowns, divided by the Total Orders Placed (as defined below) in that period. AOV reflects average basket size of our customers. AOV may fluctuate as we continue investing in the development and introduction of new Lulus merchandise and as a result of our promotional discount activity.

Free Cash Flow

Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less cash used for capitalized software development costs and purchases of property and equipment. We view Free Cash Flow as an important indicator of our liquidity because it measures the amount of cash we generate.

Gross Margin

We define Gross Margin as gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue. Gross profit is equal to our net revenue less cost of revenue. Certain of our competitors and other retailers report cost of revenue differently than we do. As a result, the reporting of our gross profit and Gross Margin may not be comparable to other companies.

Net Debt

Net Debt is defined as total debt, which currently consists of the revolving line of credit, less cash and cash equivalents. We consider Net Debt to be an important supplemental measure of our financial position, which allows us to analyze our leverage.

Total Orders Placed

We define Total Orders Placed as the number of customer orders placed across our platform during a particular period. An order is counted on the day the customer places the order. We do not adjust the number of Total Orders Placed for any cancellation or return that may have occurred subsequent to a customer placing an order. We consider Total Orders Placed as a key performance metric on the basis that it is directly related to our ability to attract and retain customers as well as drive purchase frequency. Total Orders Placed, together with AOV, is an indicator of the net revenue we expect to generate in a particular period.

The Swedish fashion giant also posted a drop in profits for the latest quarter, driven by higher markdowns and heavy investments to win over customers.

It added that this slowed down to 1% this month amid continued pressure on consumer finances.

H&M said it had 40 net store closures over the quarter, including 35 for the eponymous H&M brand while it also closed five Monki shops.

Its recent store overhaul left the retailer with 4,213 stores at the end of last month – a reduction of 125 over the past year.

The group, which also owns the Cos and & Other Stories brands, reported that gross profit for the quarter dipped slightly to £27.2 billion from £27.7 billion.

Daniel Erver, chief executive of the business, said: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.

“We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.”

The boss added that moves to improve its assortment of female clothing were “starting to have a positive effect” in the latest quarter.

Frequently Asked Questions Q: When were ArcelorMittal's 2024 financial statements released?","On March 27, 2025, ArcelorMittal SA (MT, Financial) announced the publication of its statutory financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. These documents have been filed with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are accessible through the company's corporate website.

Positive Aspects

ArcelorMittal is committed to producing innovative, sustainable steel products that use less energy and emit less carbon.

Negative Aspects

The press release does not provide detailed financial metrics or insights into profitability or cost management for 2024.

There is no mention of specific challenges or market conditions that may have impacted the company's performance.

Financial Analyst Perspective

From a financial analyst's viewpoint, ArcelorMittal's release of its 2024 financial statements is a critical step in maintaining transparency and investor confidence. The reported revenue of $62.4 billion is a positive indicator of the company's market position and operational scale. However, the lack of detailed financial metrics such as net income, EBITDA, or cash flow statements in the press release limits a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health. Investors would benefit from additional insights into cost management strategies and profitability margins to better assess the company's performance and future outlook.

Market Research Analyst Perspective

As a market research analyst, ArcelorMittal's strong global presence and diverse customer base across industries such as automotive, engineering, and construction highlight its strategic positioning in the steel market. The company's focus on sustainable steel production aligns with global trends towards environmental responsibility and innovation. However, the press release lacks information on market dynamics, competitive positioning, and potential risks, which are crucial for understanding the company's market strategy and growth potential. Further analysis of regional market conditions and demand trends would provide a more comprehensive view of ArcelorMittal's market opportunities and challenges.

H&M’s sales saw only a 1% rise in March, following a weaker-than-expected first quarter, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer reported on Thursday.

H&M, which also owns brands like Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, is simultaneously upgrading its stores while streamlining its retail footprint.","H&M experienced a modest 1% rise in sales for March, following a weak first quarter driven by inflationary pressures. CEO Daniel Erver remains hopeful, emphasizing future reductions in brand investment costs and improvements in womenswear. The retailer continues to enhance competitiveness through celebrity collaborations and strategic pricing adjustments.

H&M’s sales saw only a 1% rise in March, following a weaker-than-expected first quarter, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer reported on Thursday. The sluggish growth highlights a challenging start to its spring and summer season.

Despite ramping up marketing efforts to revitalise its brand, returns on investment have been slow. Shares, which have already declined by 11% since the start of the year, dropped another 1% in early trading, reflecting concerns over lacklustre sales and reduced profitability.

CEO Daniel Erver acknowledged the company’s struggles, stating, “Even though we are making important strides, we are not satisfied with our first-quarter results,” as quoted by Reuters. He attributed the underwhelming performance to ongoing inflationary pressures that continue to limit consumer spending.

Erver, who has been leading H&M for just over a year, has been pushing for a turnaround with improved marketing and trendier fashion offerings. Efforts to make the brand more competitive with Zara and Shein include collaborations with high-profile celebrities such as Charli XCX.

For the December-to-February quarter, H&M posted sales of 55.3 billion Swedish crowns ($5.52 billion), reflecting a 2% increase in local currencies but falling short of analysts’ expectations of 55.9 billion crowns. March’s 1% growth was notably weaker than the 4% rise seen in the same period last year.

Regional performance varied, with sales slightly weaker in the U.S., the Nordics, and the UK, while Germany and Poland fared better. In response to rising import tariffs imposed by the U.S., CFO Adam Karlsson indicated that H&M might raise prices in the region, carefully monitoring competitors’ pricing strategies to maintain value-driven offerings.

Profitability took a hit in the first quarter due to increased discounting, marketing investments, and external economic factors. The operating profit margin fell to 2.2%, down from 3.9% a year ago. Analysts at RBC noted that higher markdowns, especially following a later Black Friday, also impacted results.

However, Erver remains optimistic, stating that brand investment costs should lessen in the second quarter, and improvements in H&M’s womenswear collection are already showing positive signs. The retailer continues to expand its celebrity collaborations, enlisting musicians Tyla and FKA Twigs to front its latest spring and summer campaigns.

H&M, which also owns brands like Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, is simultaneously upgrading its stores while streamlining its retail footprint. The company now operates 4,213 stores globally, its smallest store count since 2016.

Hennes & Mauritz AB reported a significant decrease in net profit for the first quarter as its financials were impacted by markdowns, ongoing investments, and a strong Swedish krona. The company’s net income for the three months ending February 28 was 579 million Swedish kronor (approximately $57.7 million), a decline of 53 percent from 1.23 billion kronor in the same period the previous year. This figure fell well below analysts’ expectations, which had predicted a net income of 1.28 billion kronor, according to a FactSet poll.

The company also saw its gross margin, a crucial profitability metric, narrow to 49.1 percent from 51.5 percent in the year-earlier period.

Despite these challenges, H&M recorded a 3 percent increase in sales, totaling 55.33 billion kronor (about $5.47 billion) from December 1 to February 28. Sales in local currency terms rose by 2 percent, even as the retailer operated around 3 percent fewer stores than in the previous year.

Looking ahead, H&M expects a 1 percent rise in sales in local currency terms for March.

“Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” stated Daniel Ervér, CEO of H&M.

Ervér further explained the factors influencing the quarter’s profitability: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.”

He added optimism for the near future, noting, “We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.”

The company saw positive sales trends across various regions in Europe, particularly in Germany and Poland. Additionally, online sales experienced growth as H&M expanded its upgraded e-commerce platform to more markets.

In an effort to optimize its store portfolio, H&M closed 40 underperforming locations during the quarter.

Ervér emphasized the company’s strategic focus: “Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand.

Intel is in the middle of investing $28 billion into two production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany.
Meanwhile, Intel bolstered its board through the appointments of Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, in December.

The news comes as the company also reported it provided $27.4 million in compensation last year to former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was forced out late in the year as Intel struggled financially.

Since late last year, the company has been reshuffling its board to make it more chip industry focused as it attempts to reclaim its lost glory under new leadership.

The latest move will shrink the size of the board to 11.

Intel is in the middle of investing $28 billion into two production facilities in the Licking County portion of New Albany. The project has been delayed multiple years as the company has struggled financially, and it is not expected to not open until 2031 or 2032.

The members retiring include Omar Ishrak, former CEO of medical device maker Medtronic, who had in January 2023 stepped down as Intel's chairperson but stayed on as a director.

Tsu-Jae King Liu, a dean at the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, a former professor of population health and health equity at the University of Pennsylvania, are the others leaving the board.

Meanwhile, Intel bolstered its board through the appointments of Eric Meurice, former CEO of chipmaking equipment provider ASML, and Steve Sanghi, interim CEO of Microchip Technology, in December.

The changes mark a departure from Intel's previous board structure, which was populated by leaders in academia and finance, as well as former senior executives from the medical, tech and aerospace industries.

""We are committed to having the right mix of skills, qualifications and technical expertise on the Board,"" Chairperson Frank Yeary said in the filing on Thursday.

All other current directors will stand for reelection.

Focused on product and foundry

CEO Tan said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday that ""to enable great products,"" he was ""equally focused"" on the company's product business and contract chip manufacturing business - the center of a turnaround strategy championed by former CEO Gelsinger.

Gelsinger's total severance payment stands at about $7.9 million and he has forfeited all his outstanding unvested equity awards, the company said.

Tan, who in August left Intel's board due to disagreements over the company's revival plan, rejoined as a director along with his appointment as CEO.

""We will remain focused on executing this plan to reduce our operating expenses and capital expenditures, simplify our portfolio and eliminate organizational complexity,"" Tan said, referring to the cost-savings plan introduced last year under Gelsinger, which included a 15% workforce reduction.

STOCKHOLM--Swedish fast-fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz posted lower-than-expected earnings as increased discounting, investments and a negative effect from factors like currencies and freight costs all hit profitability.

H&M sales in its fiscal first quarter--which runs from December through February--rose 2% in local currencies though sales momentum slowed in the final month of the quarter. It had previously reported 4% growth in the December to January period.

Analysts at Barclays had expected first-quarter sales to rise 2% in local currencies, with a boost from the timing of Black Friday being offset by the fact that there was one fewer trading day this year after last year's leap year.

The timing of Black Friday also meant that logistics costs increased in the first quarter and there was more discounting as part of the promotional shopping period.

""Sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned - but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,"" Chief Executive Daniel Erver said.

The company is investing heavily in new product ranges and marketing as it seeks to regain market share in an increasingly competitive environment. It said headwinds from the investments, as well as from discounting and external factors such as currency, will ease going forward, having a significantly smaller overall negative effect in the second quarter than the first.

Combined with deeper collaboration with strategic suppliers, theses factors will become a tailwind in the second half, it said.

It reported a gross margin of 49.1% in the quarter, versus the 50.5% expected by Barclays, while the operating margin slipped to 2.2% from 3.9%, missing the 3.8% expected by Barclays.

H&M's Erver has made growing sales a priority at the Swedish group through investments in improving its product offering, enhancing its digital services to boost the customer experience and increase brand awareness through higher marketing spend.

H&M still counts Asia as a large sourcing region, which has left it vulnerable to extended transportation times due to the disruption in the Red Sea, but the company has also been investing to bring more manufacturing closer to its major markets, improving supply chain flexibility and product availability.

The disruption in the Red Sea with longer transport times is continuing to affect inventory, pushing the company to have more goods on hand to ensure supply. The value of inventory held in stock rose by 9% in the quarter on year and H&M expects a higher level of discounting in the second quarter than a year ago.

""With a higher share of nearshoring, a more efficient and more flexible supply chain and more purchasing in season, there are opportunities for improvement of the stock-in-trade position in the second half of the year compared with the previous year,"" the company said.

It said it continues to plan for extended transport times and to manage disruption in the supply chain while also closely monitoring developments in global trade and trade restrictions.

H&M reported a net profit of 590 million Swedish kronor ($58.7 million) for the first quarter to Feb. 28, compared with 1.24 billion kronor a year earlier as sales rose 3.1% to 55.33 billion kronor. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected net profit of 1.28 billion kronor on sales of 55.86 billion kronor.

The company said sales in March are expected to increase by 1% in local currencies, compared with the same period the previous year.

Net sales in the three months to the end of February increased by 3% to SEK55.333 billion (€5bn/£4.3bn/$5.5bn). In local currencies net sales increased by 2% with around 3% fewer stores compared with the previous year. The local currency sales rise was below expectations.

Gross profit at the firm that also owns Cos, & Other Stories, and more dipped to SEK27.169 billion from SEK 27.655 billion, for a gross margin of 49.1%, down from 51.5%. The gross margin for the quarter was affected by “negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering”.

The Swedish krona strengthened in the quarter, with the result that currency re-measurement effects also negatively affected the gross margin compared with the previous year.

Selling and administrative expenses rose too, although they were flat in local currencies.

Operating profit plunged to a below-expectations SEK1.2 billion from SEK2 billion as the operating margin dropped to 2.2% from 3.9%, attributable to the lower gross margin. Profit after tax was down to SEK579 million from SEK1.231 billion.

CEO Daniel Ervér said sales development was “good in western, southern and eastern Europe, with positive development in Germany and Poland”. Online sales continued to develop well too, “which shows that customers appreciate our upgraded digital store”.

He added that the business is continuing to optimise the store portfolio by closing select stores: “We went into the quarter with nearly 120 fewer stores compared to the same time last year and we had 40 net store closures during the period.”

But highlighting the sluggish sales growth and the profitability issues, he said: “We made important progress in our plan and have good cost control [yet] our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned. But the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.

“We can see that the improvements we have made, especially in the women’s assortment, are starting to have a positive effect. Here we have simplified the organisation and become faster at adapting to new trends and creating a more relevant assortment. During the year we are implementing similar improvements for all our customer groups.”

Through its omni-model, the group is continuing to integrate the physical and digital sales channels, “making it easier for our customers to find what they are looking for,” he said. “The upgraded digital store was rolled out to more markets in the quarter and has been well received by our customers. Upgrades to our physical stores continues to be given high priority. In addition to rebuilds of key stores in several major cities, we are expanding customer experience upgrades to more stores in more markets during the year”.","https://media.fashionnetwork.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,width=600,height=600,format=auto/m/8735/8f73/af46/2fed/33bc/211c/9317/9cec/a9b6/d70b/d70b.jpg",N,,2025-03-27 12:17:17.964652

H&M Q1 sales miss expectations, up 2%

March sales grow by just 1%

Operating profit margin falls to 2.2%

H&M CEO says marketing investments will bear fruit

By Helen Reid

LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) – H&M’s HMb.ST sales were up just 1% in March after a weaker than expected first quarter, the Swedish fast-fashion retailer reported on Thursday, in a sign of a slow start to its spring and summer season.

H&M has ramped up marketing spend in a bid to boost its brand but the returns on that investment have been slow to appear. Its shares, down 11% since the start of the year, fell 1% in early trading in response to the anaemic sales growth and lower profitability.

“Even if we are taking important steps, we are not satisfied with our result in the first quarter,” CEO Daniel Erver said in a call with analysts.

“We are still in a high inflation climate where the customers’ spending power is limited, so we stay very focused on providing outstanding value for money.”

Erver, who has led H&M for just over a year, is trying to turn its fortunes around through better marketing and more fashionable clothes, spending on pop stars like Charli XCX to model its collections as he tries to make the brand more desirable and able to compete more effectively against Zara and Shein.

The company’s sales of 55.3 billion Swedish crowns ($5.52 billion) for the December to February quarter, were up 2% in local currencies but below analysts’ mean estimate of 55.9 billion Swedish crowns. March sales growth was weaker than the 4% increase reported a year ago.

Sales were slightly weaker in the U.S., the Nordics and the UK in the first quarter, Erver said, while Germany and Poland performed better.

In the U.S., H&M will likely hike prices to mitigate the impact of import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, chief financial officer Adam Karlsson told analysts.

“We will follow how competitors do this and we will be very diligent in how we assess that we continue to give relatively better value than anyone else,” Karlsson said.

H&M’s biggest manufacturing hubs are China, where the U.S. has already placed an additional 20% tariff on imports, and Bangladesh, one of the countries at risk of so-called “reciprocal” tariffs Trump plans to announce on April 2.

Increased discounting, marketing investments and “negative external factors” impacted H&M’s profitability in the quarter, with the operating profit margin falling to 2.2% from 3.9% in the same period a year ago.

Markdowns were higher than expected due to a later Black Friday, RBC analysts said.

Erver said the hit to profitability from investments in the brand would be smaller in the second quarter, and improvements to H&M’s womenswear product assortment were starting to have a positive effect.

H&M reported first quarter earnings that came in below expectations, with analysts saying it was another disappointing update from the high street clothing chain.

The shares fell 5% in early trading but by mid-morning were up 2%, having already fallen over 20% over the past six months.

Earnings per share were 0.37 Swedish krona (SEK), around 40% below the consensus of SEK 0.62, as group sales rose 2% in constant currency to SEK 55.3 billion, missing consensus of SEK 55.8 billion.

Gross margin declined by 240 basis points to 49.1%, impacted by higher markdowns, investment in the product range and negative external effects.

Operating expenses were flat year-on-year and represented 46.9% of sales. EBIT margin fell to 2.2%, missing the consensus forecast of 3.2%.

Inventory rose 9% to SEK 41 billion, while store numbers fell to 4,949 following 40 closures.

Current trading indicates March sales will rise 1% in local currency. Gross margin pressure is expected to persist into the second quarter, though with less impact than the first quarter.

Deutsche Bank noted limited support for the share price outside of possible share purchases by the Persson family.

""Another disappointing update from H&M today despite expectations already being relatively low,"" analysts said.

In terms of outlook, they said the external drivers for gross margin ""are expected to be negative but with less gross margin pressure"" than in the first quarter, and there is ""a risk"" of further currency translation pressure given the stronger SEK that may weigh on consensus as well.

""Given current trading is at the weaker end of expectations and [second quarter] gross margin still looks under pressure, we see the shares down LSD-MSD% [low single digits to mid single digit] today.

""The valuation provides some support but we would expect some Persson family purchasing of shares to be the only material factor to help the share price.""",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzAzXC8yMDIzLTAzLTMwLTE1LTM0LTM1LWI3ZjEyOTA1OWY4Mzg3NTFkNjBjNTEyNTIwN2JjMmM3LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-03-27 12:17:34.758413

STOCKHOLM--Swedish fast-fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz posted lower-than-expected earnings as increased discounting, investments and a negative effect from factors like currencies and freight costs all hit profitability.

H&M sales in its fiscal first quarter--which runs from December through February--rose 2% in local currencies though sales momentum slowed in the final month of the quarter. It had previously reported 4% growth in the December to January period.

Analysts at Barclays had expected first-quarter sales to rise 2% in local currencies, with a boost from the timing of Black Friday being offset by the fact that there was one fewer trading day this year after last year's leap year.

H&M reported a net profit of 590 million Swedish kronor ($58.7 million) for the first quarter to Feb. 28, compared with 1.24 billion kronor a year earlier as sales rose 3.1% to 55.33 billion kronor. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected net profit of 1.28 billion kronor on sales of 55.86 billion kronor.

The company said sales in March are expected to increase by 1% in local currencies, compared with the same period the previous year.

The group, which also owns the Cos and & Other Stories brands, reported that gross profit for the quarter dipped slightly to £27.2 billion from £27.7 billion.

Daniel Erver, chief executive of the business, said: “Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering.

“We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

However, the lack of preliminary data or insights into expected performance may leave investors speculating about the company's financial health. Analysts will be keen to hear about any strategic initiatives or market trends discussed during the call that could impact Polaris' future performance.

The company's diverse product lineup and global reach position it well in the powersports market. However, the absence of specific market insights or competitive analysis in the press release suggests that stakeholders will need to tune into the conference call for a deeper understanding of the company's market positioning and strategy.

As an industry, that is going to become table stakes.” Cultural Relevance Speaking of cultural moments, Gap is currently in the midst of one.","Between the tariff tug-of-war, flailing markets, insanely high egg prices and general “twitchiness” (as one strategist put it), consumers have gotten a bit hard to nail down lately. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the dominating “talk” among retail executives at Shoptalk this week has revolved around what exactly consumers want and need right now.

One thing is clear — it’s not AI. (Although AI may be the vehicle that helps retailers give it to them.) In fact, AI was held at a pleasant distance at the annual retail conference, which kicked off Tuesday in Las Vegas. While the world’s favorite two-letter acronym for the past 18 months did crop up, of course, it wasn’t the central focus of the event. Instead, executives from across the retail spectrum zeroed in on how they’re connecting with and serving consumers in this complicated economic and geopolitical moment.

Here’s what some of the leading minds in retail say consumers need now.

Products that Perform

Consumer appliance brand SharkNinja develops 25 products from the ground up every year, which puts the company in a pretty good position to know what consumers are looking for. In some cases, it may be a product that taps into the latest TikTok trend or delivers new functionality to a mainstay category like vacuums. But at the end of the day, the common theme is developing “products that consumers love; that is where our business starts and stops,” said SharkNinja CEO Mark Barrocas in a keynote address.

“The consumer is incredibly discerning — we’re not competing against other small appliance companies; we’re competing against restaurants, we’re competing against vacations,” Barrocas said. “The consumer has a certain amount of money to spend, and they’re going to decide the best way for them to spend those dollars, so we’ve got to work hard developing the best product and getting the consumer excited. We can’t be in a break-to-fix business because our products last for years. We’ve got to put our products into retirement before [the end of] their usable life [with new innovations].”

But creating innovative, high-quality products that differentiate has become even harder in a world of dupes, according to Barrocas: “You get a one-year head start,” he said. “We come to market with a product, and we know that that product is going to get bought by 50 competitors within the first month, and they’re going to tear it down, they’re going to reverse engineer, they’re going to figure out how to make it cheaper, so we need to keep innovating.”

There’s no fighting the speed at which the world now moves. Instead, Barrocas believes the only option is to “embrace the plan changing, embrace the pivoting and spot the smoke early,” he said. “Don’t wait for there to be a raging fire before you realize there’s a problem. If there’s a small puff of smoke, start pivoting and start figuring out how you need to maneuver. What I’m most proud of is the ability to be able to spot challenges in the business and react quickly.”

Persuasive Storytelling

One of the newer ways retailers are connecting with consumers (and helping brands do the same) is through media offerings. Lisa Valentino — who became President of Ads at Best Buy five months ago after years at more traditional media companies like Yahoo, ESPN, Condé Nast and Disney — talked about retail media’s power to serve at “the intersection of influence and performance.”

Regardless of its relative newness, Valentino said that retail media is still media, and traditional tenets still apply: “Media is about persuasive storytelling. It’s all about creating a palette for brands to create those really important connections with consumers; that’s what media should do,” she advised. And this applies to both the newer retail media networks and companies that have ruled the media landscape for decades.

For retailers, that storytelling must also take place in stores, which have become a unique proposition in the evolving (and expanding) media landscape. “Everything we’re trying to do is to better the customer experience and better serve them,” shared Aaron Dunford, VP of Media at Nordstrom. “How do we help people feel good and look their best? When we widen the aperture of what commerce media is and take that broader definition, it allows us to better help and serve our customers through those media channels.”

As an example, Dunford pointed to one of the retailer’s earliest offerings, which was to give brand partners access to the company’s famed stylists. He also talked about unique in-store seasonal installations that drive brand discovery, including an alpine-themed yurt and a new immersive swim shop.

“Retail should be inspirational,” Dunford said. “What we’re looking to do is create an environment for our customer in stores where they can not only find the product they love, but be inspired by some of the best brands in the world. We’ve really been focused on, not necessarily screens per se, but how do we build a curated, experiential, visually compelling content experience for our customers?”

Contextual Relevance

Another core tenet of media is ensuring that content, especially advertising, is relevant to viewers. Retailers are finding unique ways to take this to new levels via their media offerings.

Harvey Ma, VP and General Manager of the Sam’s Club Member Access Platform media offering, talked about the kinds of ads now available on its in-store “scan-and-go” mobile self-checkout devices. Beyond being delivered at a highly relevant moment, the content itself also is carefully curated to that moment. “Those ads don’t always feel like ads,” he said. “Some of them are ‘Did you forget?’ or ‘You might like this’ types of additive experiences.”

“At Sam’s Club we’ve got a very highly technical term for commerce media — shopping,” added Ma. “Joking aside, commerce media is just getting the right ads at the right time to the right people in the right space.”

And as retailers enter the media space, legacy media companies are steadily moving into commerce, bringing in contextual shopping experiences.

Alison Levin, President of Advertising and Partnerships at NBCUniversal, isn’t a huge fan of the term “legacy,” but recognizes the need to distinguish between new and more seasoned players in media: “NBCU has this incredible reach, this IP, this emotional connection and executional excellence,” she said. “Call it what you want to call it; you can call it legacy, but it works, and it’s continued to work for a really, really long time.”

Case in point was the recent Saturday Night Live 50th anniversary event. “When you think about engagement, moments that matter for a brand, there’s no better example of that than SNL 50,” said Levin. “This was a cultural phenomenon the entire country was talking about it, and we had brands that integrated into the content like they’ve never done before.” One prime example was Capital One’s “Delicious Dish” spot.

“There have been incredible advancements in shoppability on the TV screen and removing the friction that existed before we had QR codes,” Levin added. “We have AI now that scans content to find what’s in the show and [is] available to buy it after. We have cart integration. As an industry, that is going to become table stakes.”

Cultural Relevance

Speaking of cultural moments, Gap is currently in the midst of one. Following years of flagging performance, Gap’s profit and sales exceeded forecasts this past holiday shopping season, and the company is beginning to enjoy the results of a massive turnaround effort led by President and CEO Richard Dickson.

Central to this effort has been answering the question, “Why do we exist?” said Dickson. “Does anybody really need another pair of jeans or another T-shirt or Oxford, or anything for that matter? We had to find our point of difference, and then the next stage of that is taking cues from insights, cultural trends, design trends, what’s hot, what’s not, cultural conversations and [determining] how we integrate our brand into the cultural conversation to be relevant. If you’re relevant enough, it eventually drives [consumers] to you.”

Part of this effort has involved drawing on Gap’s legacy in American retail, which, among other initiatives, included the resurfacing of a series of portrait collaborations with cultural icons from the ’90s, including Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Missy Elliott and others. The next step is identifying “who are the ‘originals’ of today and tomorrow” and working with them, said Dickson. The goal is to “perpetuate that legacy by creating narratives around today’s influencers, today’s cultural periods, today’s artists and original thinkers that ultimately will be celebrated and given a Gap portrait, which keeps the brand’s legacy alive but then translates it into cultural relevance for today.”

Immediate Access

It’s not only the product innovation cycle that has sped up — consumers also expect to find and get those products fast. DoorDash and CVS can attest to this reality.

Since its inception as a restaurant delivery service in 2013, DoorDash has rapidly expanded well beyond the food category; in fact, the company just added footwear retailer DSW to its roster of non-restaurant brands, which now also includes Home Depot, Five Below, David’s Bridal, Starbucks, Hustler Hollywood and many others.

Mike Goldblatt, VP of Grocery and Retail Partnerships at DoorDash, said that last-minute, urgent purchases are the most common entry point into DoorDash’s non-restaurant offerings for consumers who used to be, or still are, a restaurant customer of DoorDash.

“We launched seven new categories last year, and as we’re introducing these categories to customers, the typical first purchase is going to be [along the lines of], ‘I’m missing this thing; I need it right now,’” Goldblatt said. “But then a switch goes off with the consumer where we build frequency and lifetime value as they start thinking of Best Buy or Dick’s Sporting Goods on DoorDash. I know I can get a quick need, but I also know the full selection is available.”

(For a fun example, check out this TikTok of a New Yorker who DoorDashed shorts from Dick’s while on a date.)

The immediate availability of a wide array of products is the key to drawing in consumers at CVS as well, where the retail business (as opposed to its pharmacy offerings) accounted for three-quarters of foot traffic last year.

“If you want tennis balls, you can wait for them to be delivered or you can go to a big-box sporting goods store, but if you’re on the way to the courts shouldn’t you be able to go somewhere really convenient along the way?” said Musab Balbale, SVP and Chief Merchandising Officer of CVS Health during a session. “It’s almost like the old general store — that is the core of what we offer.”

Learn more about how CVS is achieving that goal with an intricate localization strategy here.

Value Without Compromise

The last but certainly not least pillar in this current economic moment is value. But as a number of executives pointed out, consumers today expect value without having to compromise convenience or ethics.

“Customers are just not willing to sacrifice,” said Kevin Tulip, U.S. President of Primark. “They want and expect value, but they’re not looking to sacrifice on experience or the environment or which trend or season they’re looking at.”

This can be a tough nut to crack, especially for companies operating at the lower end of the price spectrum. But Primark has found a way to do it. “Overall, price is what we’ve built the business around, and over the last 15, 16 years, we have continued to build on top of that quality, style and trends.",https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Shoptalk-stage-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 12:17:08.595462

ROCKVILLE, Md. and SUZHOU, China, March 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ascentage Pharma Group International (Ascentage Pharma) (NASDAQ: AAPG; HKEX: 6855) (referred hereinto as “Ascentage Pharma,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), a global, integrated biopharmaceutical company engaged in discovering, developing and commercializing therapies to address global unmet medical needs primarily in hematological malignancies, today reported its unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2024, and provided updates on key clinical and commercial developments.

Dr. Dajun Yang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ascentage Pharma, said, “As we reflect on our achievements in 2024, I am delighted to report that Ascentage Pharma has made remarkable strides in advancing our mission to deliver innovative therapies to patients worldwide. The commercialization of olverembatinib in China has gained significant traction in 2024 and is poised for growth in 2025 as all approved indications of olverembatinib are now covered under China’s National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), markedly enhancing affordability and accessibility for patients across China.”

He continued, “Our momentum continued with the advancement of lisaftoclax. In November 2024, the New Drug Application (NDA) for lisaftoclax for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) was accepted by the Center of Drug Evaluation (CDE) of China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) with Priority Review designation. This acceptance marks a pivotal step toward bringing this novel therapy to patients in need.”

“Our clinical development programs also achieved significant progress over the past year. In February 2024, olverembatinib received clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate a global registrational Phase III clinical trial (POLARIS-2), for patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase (CML-CP) with or without T315I mutation who have previously failed tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. In 2024, we also received clearance to commence two registrational Phase III clinical trials for APG-2449, a focal adhesion kinase (FAK), third generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and receptor tyrosine kinase C-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) inhibitor, for treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). At the moment, we are conducting ten global registrational trials, including two that were cleared by the FDA, for our three late-stage products, olverembatinib, lisaftoclax and APG-2449. These milestones highlight our commitment to addressing unmet medical needs through rigorous clinical innovation.”

“We believe Ascentage Pharma is on a transformative path to becoming a global leader in oncology innovation. The commercialization of olverembatinib in China, the progress of lisaftoclax, the continued development of our other clinical-stage small molecule drug assets, and our strategic agreement with Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG (Takeda) reflect the strength of our pipeline and our ability to execute on our goals. In 2025, we remain focused on accelerating the development and delivery of life-changing therapies, expanding our global footprint, and creating sustainable value for all stakeholders.”

Key Business and Pipeline Updates

Olverembatinib (HQP1351), a novel, next-generation TKI and the first third-generation BCR-ABL1 TKI, has been approved in China for treatment of patients with CML-CP or Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Accelerated Phase (CML-AP) with T315I mutations and CML-CP that is resistant and/or intolerant to first and second-generation TKIs.

Commercial progress

Revenue from sales of olverembatinib in China was US$33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to US$21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$11.1 million, or 52%. As of December 31, 2024, the number of direct-to-pharmacy (DTP) pharmacies and hospitals where olverembatinib is on formulary reached 734. In particular, the number of hospitals where olverembatinib is on formulary increased 86% compared to December 31, 2023.

In November 2024, a new indication – adult patients with CML-CP resistant and/or intolerant of first-and second-generation TKIs – for olverembatinib was included in China’s NRDL through the simplified contract renewal procedure. Concurrently, the contracts for indications of olverembatinib which has been included China’s NRDL since 2022 were renewed successfully. The current indications of olverembatnib eligible for reimbursement includes adult patients with CML-CP or CML-AP with T315I mutation, and adult patients with CML-CP that are resistant and/or intolerant of first-and second-generation TKIs.

Clinical progress

After receiving clearance from the CDE of China’s NMPA in May 2024, we commenced enrollment in a registrational Phase III clinical trial of olverembatinib for the treatment of patients with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who have failed prior systemic treatment (POLARIS-3).

After receiving clearance from the FDA in February 2024, we commenced enrollment in a registrational Phase III clinical trial of olverembatinib for previously treated CML-CP patients, both with and without T315I mutation (POLARIS-2).

We continue enrollment in a registrational Phase III clinical trial of olverembatinib in combination with chemotherapy versus imatinib in combination with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) (POLARIS-1).

We obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for olverembatinib in March 2025 from the CDE of China’s NMPA for combination with low-intensity chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of newly-diagnosed patients with Ph+ ALL.

Anticipated progress

We plan to seek clearance from the FDA to initiate a registrational Phase III clinical trial in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL patients.

Lisaftoclax (APG-2575) is a novel, oral Bcl-2 inhibitor developed to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors by selectively blocking Bcl-2 to restore the normal apoptosis process in cancer cells.

Regulatory progress

NDA for lisaftoclax monotherapy for the treatment of R/R CLL or small SLL was accepted with Priority Review designation by the CDE of China’s NMPA in November 2024.

Clinical progress

After lisaftoclax received initial clearance by the CDE of China’s NMPA in May 2024, we commenced enrollment of patients in a global, multicenter, registrational Phase III clinical trial of lisaftoclax in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of patients who are newly diagnosed with higher risk (HR) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (GLORA-4).

We continue enrollment in a global registrational Phase III clinical trial of lisaftoclax for the treatment of newly diagnosed old or unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (GLORA-3).

We continue enrollment in a global registrational Phase III clinical trial to evaluate lisaftoclax in combination with the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib, versus immunochemotherapy in treatment-naïve patients with CLL/SLL (GLORA-2) to validate a fixed duration of combination regimen as a first-line treatment.

We continue enrollment in a global registrational Phase III clinical trial of lisaftoclax in combination with BTK inhibitors in patients with CLL/SLL previously treated with BTK inhibitors (GLORA).

We continue Phase 1b/2 clinical trials of lisaftoclax in combination therapies for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) in China and the United States.

Anticipated progress

We plan to seek clearance from the FDA to initiate a registrational Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of patients who are newly diagnosed with HR MDS.

APG-2449 is a novel, orally active, small-molecule FAK, the third generation of ALK and receptor tyrosine kinase ROS1 triple ligase TKI.

Clinical progress

APG-2449 was cleared by the CDE of NMPA in October 2024 to initiate two registrational Phase III clinical trials to evaluate APG-2449 in patients with NSCLC who are either resistant to or intolerant of second-generation ALK TKIs or treatment-naïve patients with ALK-positive advanced or locally advanced NSCLC.

Business Updates

We entered into an exclusive option agreement in June 2024 with Takeda (Exclusive Option Agreement), pursuant to which Ascentage Pharma granted Takeda an exclusive option to enter into an exclusive license for olverembatinib. If exercised, the Exclusive Option Agreement would allow Takeda to license global rights to develop and commercialize olverembatinib in all territories outside of China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and Russia.

We received a US$100 million intellectual property income and option payment from Takeda in July 2024 under the Exclusive Option Agreement.

We completed a US$75 million equity investment from Takeda in June 2024.

We completed Ascentage Pharma’s U.S. initial public offering of American depositary shares in January 2025, resulting in net proceeds of US$132.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.

Full Year 2024 Unaudited Financial Results

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 was US$134.3 million, compared to US$30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$103.8 million, or 342%. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an option payment of US$100 million received in June 2024 from Takeda pursuant to the Exclusive Option Agreement, sales of olverembatinib of US$33.0 million, a 52% year-over-year increase, commercialization rights income from Innovent Biologics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. and management fee income.

Selling and distribution expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$26.9 million, compared to US$26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$0.1 million, or 0.3%. The increase was attributable to selling and distribution expenses incurred in the commercialization of olverembatinib and other products.

Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$129.8 million, compared to US$97.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$32.5 million, or 34.0%. The increase was attributable to higher clinical research expenses.

Administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$25.6 million, compared to US$24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$0.7 million, or 3.3%. The increase was due to the increase in the agency fees for the U.S. initial public offering.

Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$8.8 million, compared to US$13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented a decrease of US$4.4 million, or 32.9%. The decrease was due to the interest rate incurred in relation to bank borrowings.

Other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$1.2 million, compared to US$0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase of US$0.5 million, or 74.4%. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in donation expenses.

Loss for the year ended December 31, 2024 was US$55.6 million, compared to US$127.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented a decrease of US$71.8 million, or 56.2%. The loss per share attributable to ordinary equity holders was $0.18 per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0.45 per ordinary share for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cash and bank balances for the year ended December 31, 2024 were US$172.8 million, compared to US$150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented an increase by US$22.3 million, or 15.3%. The increase was primarily due to the US$100.0 million intellectual property income and option payment under the Exclusive Option Agreement and US$75.0 million equity investment from Takeda. Part of the Takeda option payment was treated as intellectual property income.

Following our initial public offering in January 2025, which resulted in net proceeds of $132.5 million, as of March 27, 2025, we believe that these net proceeds, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, our loan facilities, future sales and other potential payments, will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through 2027.

H&M on Thursday posted weaker-than-expected sales in the fiscal first quarter in a slow start to the year as depressed demand continues to weigh on the world's second-largest clothing retailer.

Sales at the Swedish fashion giant rose 2% in local currencies to 55.33 billion Swedish krona ($5.5 billion) year-on-year in the three-month period to Feb. 28, slightly below the 55.86 billion forecast by LSEG analysts.

Shares were down 1.6% by 8:08 a.m. London time.

Operating profit totaled 1.2 billion in the company's first quarter, versus 1.9 billion Swedish krona expected, resulting in an operating margin of 2.2%.

The retailer attributed the weaker operating profit to ""negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering,"" which impacted gross margins.

The company noted, however, that such factors were ""estimated to already be significantly smaller in the second quarter,"" pointing to an anticipated 1% annual uptick in March sales.

""Our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,"" CEO Daniel Ervér said in a statement.

""Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth,"" he added.

It follows several consecutive quarters of weak sales for the Swedish fashion giant, which has struggled to close a widening gap with Inditex-owned rival Zara and higher competition from lower-cost retailers such as Chinese-founded fast fashion giant Shein.

The results mark the latest test for CEO Ervér, who was appointed to the role in January 2024 to accelerate the group's turnaround.

Sales increased by 2% in local currencies to SEK 55.3 billion (£4.3bn), falling slightly short of analyst expectations.

“Our operating profit was affected by the temporary challenges related to gross margin development, as well as the ongoing investments in our customer proposition,” said CEO Daniel Ervér.

“Despite these hurdles, we remain focused on strengthening our product offering and improving our in-store and online shopping experience.”

Despite the weaker-than-expected results, Ervér remained optimistic about the long-term prospects of the business, adding: “We continue to invest in our core business, focusing on driving growth through a more integrated and efficient customer experience across both physical and digital channels. We’re confident that the measures we’re taking will support sustainable and profitable growth in the coming months.”

LONDON (Reuters) -Swedish fast-fashion retailer H&M’s sales were up just 1% in March after a weaker than expected first quarter, in a sign of a slow start to its spring and summer season.

H&M has ramped up marketing spend in a bid to boost its brand but the returns on that investment have been slow to appear. Its shares fell 1% in early trading on Thursday in response to the anaemic sales growth and lower profitability.

“Our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward,” CEO Daniel Erver said in a statement.

Erver, who has led H&M for just over a year, is trying to turn its fortunes around through better marketing, spending on pop stars like Charli XCX to model its collections as he tries to make the brand more desirable and better compete against Zara and Shein.

The company’s sales of 55.3 billion Swedish crowns ($5.52 billion) for the December to February quarter, were up 2% in local currencies but below analysts’ mean estimate of 55.9 billion Swedish crowns. March sales growth was weaker than the 4% increase reported a year ago.

Increased discounting, marketing investments and “negative external factors” impacted H&M’s profitability in the quarter, the company said, with the operating profit margin falling to 2.2% from 3.9% in the same period a year ago.

Markdowns in the first quarter were higher than expected due to a later Black Friday, RBC analysts said.

In his statement, Erver said the hit to profitability from investments in the brand would be smaller in the second quarter, and improvements to H&M’s womenswear product assortment were starting to have a positive effect.

After hosting a string of Charli XCX concerts last year, H&M has continued to invest in big-name brand ambassadors, hiring musicians Tyla and FKA Twigs to model its spring and summer collection launched last week.

The retailer, which also owns brands including Arket, Cos, & Other Stories, and Weekday, has been upgrading stores and sharply reducing its overall number of stores. H&M has 4,213 stores globally, it reported on Thursday, its smallest store footprint since 2016.

H & M Hennes & Mauritz AB Three-month report 2025

First quarter (1 December 2024 – 28 February 2025)

The H&M group’s net sales in the first quarter increased by 3 percent to SEK 55,333 m (53,669). In local currencies net sales increased by 2 percent with around 3 percent fewer stores compared with the previous year.

Gross profit amounted to SEK 27,169 m (27,655). This corresponds to a gross margin of 49.1 percent (51.5). The gross margin for the quarter was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering. The Swedish krona strengthened in the first quarter, with the result that currency remeasurement effects have also negatively affected the gross margin compared with the previous year.

Selling and administrative expenses amounted to SEK 25,938 m (25,564). In local currencies these expenses were on par with the previous year.

Operating profit amounted to SEK 1,203 m (2,077), corresponding to an operating margin of 2.2 percent (3.9). The decrease in operating profit is attributable to the lower gross margin.

The result after tax amounted to SEK 579 m (1,2311).

The stock-in-trade amounted to SEK 41,008 m (37,630), an increase by 9 percent. Currency adjusted the stock-in-trade increased by 11 percent compared with the previous year. Higher purchasing costs reflected in the weaker gross margin in the first quarter explain the majority of the increase in stock-in-trade. In addition, extended transport times associated with the situation in the Red Sea continued to affect inventory. The composition of the stock-in-trade is assessed to be good.

Cash flow from operating activities increased to SEK 4,201 m (3,967). Cash and cash equivalents plus undrawn credit facilities were SEK 34,470 m (38,710).

The H&M group’s sales in the month of March 2025 are expected to increase by 1 percent in local currencies compared with the same month the previous year.

The overall negative effect from external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering is estimated to already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter, while collaboration with strategic suppliers is being deepened and bringing additional positive effects. At present the conditions are in place for these to have a positive overall effect in the second half of the year compared with the previous year, with the customer offering being strengthened at the same time.

The H&M group is included in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s A List for its leadership within transparency and climate impact.

Today the H&M group publishes its annual and sustainability report 2024. Among other things, the report shows that the greenhouse gas emissions in scope 32 reduced by around 24 percent in 2024 compared to the 2019 baseline.

The annual general meeting will be held on 7 May 2025 to resolve, among other things, on the board’s proposed dividend of SEK 6.80 per share, to be paid in two instalments, and on a general authorisation allowing the board to buy back the group’s own B shares in the period up to the 2026 annual general meeting.

“Sales increased by 3 percent in SEK in the first quarter, with well-received women’s collections. Operating profit and profitability were impacted by temporarily challenging development of the gross margin. Our main priorities are a strengthened product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. Through this we create the conditions for long-term, profitable and sustainable growth”, Daniel Ervér, CEO.

Comments by Daniel Ervér, CEO

Sales in the first quarter increased by 3 percent in SEK and by 2 percent in local currencies. Sales development was good in western, southern and eastern Europe, with positive development in Germany and Poland. Online sales continued to develop well, which shows that customers appreciate our upgraded digital store. We are continuing to optimise the store portfolio by closing select stores. We went into the quarter with nearly 120 fewer stores compared to the same time last year and we had 40 net store closures during the period.

Profitability in the quarter was negatively impacted by a weaker gross margin, which in turn was affected by negative external factors, increased markdowns and investments in the customer offering. We estimate that the overall negative effect of these will already be significantly smaller in the second quarter than in the first quarter.

Although we have made important progress in our plan and have good cost control, our sales and earnings in the quarter were somewhat weaker than planned – but the first quarter is the smallest quarter of the year for us in terms of sales and margin, and we are confident going forward.

We can see that the improvements we have made, especially in the women’s assortment, are starting to have a positive effect. Here we have simplified the organisation and become faster at adapting to new trends and creating a more relevant assortment. During the year we are implementing similar improvements for all our customer groups.

Through our omni-model we are continuing to integrate the physical and digital sales channels, making it easier for our customers to find what they are looking for. The upgraded digital store was rolled out to more markets in the quarter and has been well received by our customers. Upgrades to our physical stores continues to be given high priority. In addition to rebuilds of key stores in several major cities, we are expanding customer experience upgrades to more stores in more markets during the year.

We have a stable financial position that gives us the flexibility to prioritise what creates the most value for our customers. With macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, it is important that we continue to focus fully on our plan and offer the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability for everyone. We are therefore further strengthening our customer offering through an upgraded product offering, a more inspiring shopping experience and a stronger brand. This creates the conditions for long-term profitable and sustainable growth, with the H&M brand and organic growth in focus.

Cognizant highlighted its ambition to achieve top-tier revenue growth among its peers by 2027, while steadily bridging the gap with them in terms of revenue growth rate, Nomura noted. The key read-through for Indian IT is that the sluggishness may persist in the near term and that the expanding of addressable market is an imperative, said Kotak Institutional Equities, adding that competitive intensity for Indian IT sector may rise in the near term.

Nomura India said Cognizant’s revenue growth gap against peers’ average improved steadily from minus 800 basis points (bps) in 2022 to 50 basis points in 2024, and the company aspires to grow above the peer average in 2025-26.

Cognizant sees growth drivers including market share gains, strengthening AI capabilities and leveraging platforms, sustaining large deal momentum, tapping underpenetrated markets in the Americas and selective expansion in the EMEA and leveraging partnership channel.

Kotak said Cognizant's renewed focus on large and mega deals, coupled with a focus on driving productivity in technology through AI and sharing it with clients and consolidating out vendors where possible, can increase the competitive intensity for Indian IT in the near to medium term.

“The unique needs of each banner at this time—transformation at Family Dollar and growth acceleration at Dollar Tree—lead us to the decision to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business,” former Dollar Tree Chairman and CEO Rick Dreiling said at the time.
Dollar Tree offset more than 90% of the incremental cost of the 10% tariff on China as of Feb. 4.
Distribution center changes Dollar Tree will replace the distribution center in Marietta, Ga., that was hit by an F4 tornado later this year.
The Family Dollar distribution center in Odessa, Texas, will be converted to a Dollar Tree DC.","The journey of figuring out what to do with the Family Dollar brand has finally come to an end as Dollar Tree announced it entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Family Dollar business to Brigade and Macellum for just over $1 billion, the retailer revealed during its fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday.

The agreement was official on Tuesday and net proceeds are estimated to total about $804 million.

The deal is expected to close in about 90 days.

“This is a very exciting day for our company,” Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon said during the call. “The sale of Family Dollar is the best way to achieve … our goals. With Dollar Tree as our sole focus … we can return to our roots.”

Dollar Tree initiated a formal review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar brand in mid-2024.

“The unique needs of each banner at this time—transformation at Family Dollar and growth acceleration at Dollar Tree—lead us to the decision to conduct a thorough review of strategic alternatives for the Family Dollar business,” former Dollar Tree Chairman and CEO Rick Dreiling said at the time.

It was a relatively solid fourth quarter for Dollar Tree, as net sales increased 0.7% year over year to $5 billion, and same-store net sales grew by 2%, driven by a 0.7% increase in traffic and a 1.3% rise in average ticket. For the first time since Q4 of 2022, average ticket grew faster than traffic, according to Creedon.

For the first quarter of 2025, the Chesapeake, Va.-based retailer expects net sales to fall in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, based on comparable store net sales growth of 3% to 5%.

“Dollar Tree is seeing middle-income shoppers, who make up about half of our customer base, focusing more on value,” Creedon said. “At the same time, we are seeing stronger demand from higher-income customers who increasingly view Dollar Tree as a cost-effective source for an expanding range of products.”

Tariff talk

Dollar Tree spent a significant amount of time during the earnings call discussing its strategy regarding tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, as well as retaliatory tariffs. Creedon said multiple contingencies are in place to address various tariff scenarios, including negotiating supplier cost concessions, changing product specifications, dropping non-economical items, moving the country of origin, and exercising the flexibility the multi-price format offers.

“We intend to remain flexible and nimble, focusing our efforts on sourcing products via channels that deliver the lowest landed cost in order to maintain value continuity for our customers,” Creedon said.

Dollar Tree offset more than 90% of the incremental cost of the 10% tariff on China as of Feb. 4. The impact of the second round of tariffs levied in March has not been included in the 2025 outlook.

Multi-price means one result: success

The discount retailer’s multi-price format boosted Q4 performance, according to Creedon. The 3.0 stores are either new or converted stores that offer an expanded multi-price assortment throughout the store. The 2.0 stores have a smaller multi-price assortment concentrated in a single aisle called The Valley, and 1.0 stores have 95% of products tagged at $1.25.

Creedon said 3.0 stores performed better than the other formats during the fourth quarter. Dollar Tree operates 2,900 3.0 stores, including about 2,600 store conversions and 300 new stores.

The goal is to have 5,200 3.0 stores by the end of 2025, including 2,000 conversions and 300 new stores.

Luckin Coffee filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy and exited administration in 2022, minus the executive team that had overseen the accounting fraud.
Since then, the coffee chain has surpassed Starbucks to be China’s largest coffee retailer in terms of sales.
About 97% of its locations are in the Chinese market, though it boasts over 6,400 teahouses in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.
Both brands are expanding rapidly, with the U.S. market being the next frontier.","Starbucks has been pushing hard to reverse slowing sales under the direction of newly installed CEO Brian Niccol, as Inc. detailed. Some of those changes include the reintroduction of condiment bars, a massive order of Sharpies as the coffee chain returns to personalizing customer cups, and a leaner, trimmed menu. But as the company attempts to reinvent itself in the process of “getting back to Starbucks,” thematically speaking, it now faces further competition in the form of two Chinese chains entering the U.S. market.

First up: Chinese tea chain Chagee, which Forbes reported plans to open its first U.S. location in Los Angeles sometime this spring. A U.S. IPO on the Nasdaq is apparently also in the works.

Secondly, reports indicate that Chinese beverage chain Luckin Coffee is also eying a New York-based location in terms of entry into the American beverage market. Those same reports suggest that drinks will be priced between $2 and $3, with Luckin Coffee initially targeting cities with larger Chinese student and tourist populations to gain a foothold.

Starbucks Could Find Itself Outpriced, but Both Chagee and Luckin Coffee Face Their Own Challenges

Although Starbucks may struggle to compete with both companies given its somewhat premium existing price structure, both potential competitors face hurdles of some sort in penetrating the U.S. market.

For Luckin Coffee, the problems are more obvious. Forbes noted that the company, founded in 2017, quickly outpaced Starbucks to hold more locations in its Chinese market, then went public on the Nasdaq. Only a few short years later, in 2020, Luckin admitted that it had inflated its sales — a confession that resulted in its removal from the Nasdaq and the agreement to pay a $180 million penalty.

Luckin Coffee filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy and exited administration in 2022, minus the executive team that had overseen the accounting fraud. Since then, the coffee chain has surpassed Starbucks to be China’s largest coffee retailer in terms of sales.

Concerning Chagee, the company’s history is less dramatic — although its nearly exclusive focus on the Chinese market may present difficulties in translating the brand to American shores. About 97% of its locations are in the Chinese market, though it boasts over 6,400 teahouses in China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.

Both brands are expanding rapidly, with the U.S. market being the next frontier.

Starbucks Dethroned by McDonald’s as the Latter Becomes World’s Most Valuable Restaurant Brand, Shows Weakness in China

In another bit of bad news for Starbucks, the company recently found itself overtaken by McDonald’s, the latter of which is now the world’s most valuable restaurant brand, per a report from Brand Finance. From 2024 to 2025, McDonald’s saw its brand value rise by 7% to rest at $40.5 billion, while Starbucks witnessed its brand value tumble by 36% to $38.8 billion.

Starbucks’ weak performance in China, four quarters of consecutive declining sales, and drops in metrics such as “reputation” and “recommendation” underscored the report’s findings.

“These declines highlight a growing misalignment with customer expectations and increasing consumer dissatisfaction, leading to declining sales,” the report concluded.",https://retailwire.com/wp-content/uploads/Starbucks-iStock.com-martinrlee.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 20:03:40.087120

On Wednesday, Starbucks’ stock opened higher, partly reversing the weakness experienced in the previous sessions.","Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX) has launched an extensive restructuring to streamline operations and optimize customer experience. While navigating a difficult operating environment, the coffee giant is working to revive its brand through initiatives like the mobile order facility and redesigned stores.

The company’s stock has been on a rollercoaster ride for quite some time, often reflecting investors’ concerns about the faltering sales performance. The shares have grown around 7% since entering 2025 slightly above $90. Analysts’ consensus target price suggests that SBUX is poised to cross the $100 mark once again. With the brand’s unwavering popularity and the management’s optimistic recovery strategy, Starbucks appears to be on track for a turnaround. This trajectory is likely to translate into strong shareholder value in the long term. From the investment perspective, the stock looks fairly priced right now.

Revamp

The restructuring program includes simplification of the menu, optimizing mobile ordering, and new store design. As part of the reorganization, the company recently announced plans to lay off around 1,100 corporate employees and not to fill several open positions, marking the largest downsizing in its history. Of late, Starbucks has been facing a demand slowdown in certain regions including China, its biggest market outside the U.S. Economic slowdown in the Asian country and growing competition from local brewers like Luckin Coffee remain a challenge.

From Starbucks’ Q1 2025 earnings call:

“Our work to reintroduce our brand is just beginning, but our core business is already strengthening, demonstrating that when we talk about our business, customers respond. Through the quarter, we saw a shift in our sales mix toward coffee and espresso-based beverages, which over-delivered and compensated for lower-than-expected performance across our holiday promotions. We’ve been focused on simplifying our menu to position partners for success, improve consistency, drive customer satisfaction, and enhance our economics.”

Pricing

While the company has achieved some success in attracting customers through promotional offers, its prices remain among the highest in the coffee space. It is important to have a competitive pricing strategy because several new players have entered the market in recent years, including in the US. According to the company, it is making progress in engaging non-rewards customers — frequent store visitors who are not part of the rewards program — through the revival program.

In the first three months of fiscal 2025, earnings dropped to $780.8 million or $0.69 per share from $1.02 billion or $0.90 per share in the same period of the prior year. Meanwhile, Q1 revenues remained broadly unchanged at $9.40 billion. Global comparable store sales dropped 4%, marking the fourth consecutive decline.

Results Beat

There was a 6% fall in comparable transactions, which was partially offset by a 3% increase in average ticket. At the end of the quarter, the company had a total of 34.6 million active members in the US. Sales and profit surpassed the market’s expectations, after missing in Q4 2024.

Launch of Tender Offer to execute a new €1 billion share buyback program

Today Exor announces the launch of a reverse Dutch auction Tender Offer on 27 March 2025 to repurchase Ordinary Shares for an aggregate consideration of up to (and including) €1 billion to Qualifying Shareholders1.

The price to be paid by Exor will be subject to a price cap of €98.73 and within the limits of the authorization granted by Exor’s AGM held on 28 May 2024.

The value of Investments increased by €754 million mainly driven by the positive fair value adjustment of Lingotto Funds (€570 million) and Ventures (€81 million) as well as investments made in Lingotto Funds (€61 million) and Ventures (€42 million).

The value of Others decreased by €970 million mainly driven by the reclassification of Clarivate from Others into Listed Companies (€432 million), asset disposals (€439 million) and the negative fair value adjustment of Listed securities net of positive adjustments in reinsurance vehicles and other assets (€168 million), partially offset by cash inflows and positive translation effects.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Change in financial reporting

Exor changed its reporting from 1 January 2024 as it determined that, at that date, it met the criteria for qualification as an investment entity as defined by IFRS 10. In line with IFRS requirements, the change is prospectively applied from 1 January 2024, with a material impact on the presentation of the Financial Statements, with prior period not restated, in accordance with IFRS 10.

Exor believes that this change aligns its reporting and disclosures with its business and activities, with NAV and GAV now being equal to IFRS measures (Equity and Total Assets, respectively). The terminology in this report which refers to Alternative Performance Measures (APM) is presented under section “Definitions and Alternative Performance Measures”.

Changes in consolidation

In line with IFRS requirements, Exor deconsolidated portfolio companies where it exercises significant influence or control and accounted for them at fair value, with changes recognized in the income statement. Subsidiaries that provide investment-related support services to Exor N.V., and are not investment entity themselves, continue to be consolidated on a line-by-line basis.

Impact on the financial statements

The one-off positive impact of this change on the income statement amounts to €11,776 million, of which:

a positive impact of €12,150 million resulting from the difference between the net carrying amount of investments previously consolidated or accounted for using the equity method and their fair value at the date of the change and

a negative impact of €374 million resulting from the reversal to the income statement of the OCI reserves of the deconsolidated entities and the ones which are no longer equity-accounted.

Comparison with previous period

NAV and its components at 31 December 2024 are compared to 1 January 2024 to facilitate the understanding and the comparability of measures.

For the purpose of the presentation of this press release, profit and cash flow measures for the year ended 31 December 2023 have not been restated and they are presented as previously reported under the shortened consolidation criterion (non-IFRS). While the scope of consolidation for the period ended 31 December 2024 and the period ended 31 December 2023 is the same, the full and direct comparison between dates or across periods may be inappropriate or not meaningful if not carefully considered in this context because the fair value measurement is prospectively applied from 1 January 2024.

Definitions and Alternative Performance Measures (APM)

The management of Exor has identified a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APM) to measure the Company's financial performance and financial position, which form the basis for capital allocation decisions. Management uses these non-IFRS measures to describe its operations, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions. APM are presented to the financial community to facilitate their understanding of the performance of Exor, and are in line with the industry.

To ensure that the APM are correctly interpreted, it is emphasized that these measures are not indicative of future performance. These non-IFRS financial measures have no standardized meaning under EU-IFRS, are unaudited and are unlikely to be consistent and comparable to measures used by other companies. APM are not intended to be substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with EU-IFRS.

The APM have been consistently calculated and presented for all the reporting periods for which financial information is presented in this report. Reconciliation of APM to IFRS measures can be found in section ‘Reconciliation with IFRS Financial Statements’.

Exor applies the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines to present APM, which correspond to financial measures other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework (IFRS).

As the first quarter of 2025 draws to a close, Global Drinks Intel considers which of the publicly-listed beverage alcohol brand owners in its results coverage shone in 2024 – and which ones sank.

Before we look at the year-on-year performances of the 18 listed brand owners in our coverage, let's consider the top-line showings from the 12 months of last year. The top five remain the same as 2023, with Anheuser-Busch InBev's sales totalling more than second-placed Heineken and Diageo in third, combined. The only order changes last year saw Suntory Holdings - home to Suntory Global Spirits - overtaking Moët Hennessy to snare eighth place, while Rémy Cointreau gave way to Viña Concha y Toro, dropping from 15th to 16th. We turn now to the growth rates recorded from the 12-

In court papers filed Tuesday in the Delaware Court of Chancery, Kroger said Albertsons disregarded the companies’ merger agreement and worked secretly with a partner, C&S Wholesalers, to try to force Kroger to divest more stores to C&S.

Kroger also claimed that Albertsons was secretly planning to sue Kroger if the deal didn’t go through long before the merger actually fell apart in December. Kroger said in Tuesday's court filing that it should not be forced to pay Albertsons a $600 million termination fee as well as billions of dollars in legal fees.

In a statement Tuesday, Albertsons said it was Kroger that failed to honor the merger agreement.

“Kroger’s self-interested conduct doomed the merger, and we are now focused on returning value to Albertsons’ shareholders to compensate for those losses,” Albertsons said.

Kroger and Albertsons first proposed the merger in 2022. They argued that combining would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart and Costco.

But the Federal Trade Commission and two states — Washington and Colorado — sued to block the merger last year, saying it would raise prices and lower workers’ wages by eliminating competition. It also said Kroger and Albertsons' plan to divest 579 stores C&S Wholesalers was inadequate to ensure competition, since C&S was ill-equipped to take on so many stores.

In December, judges in Washington and Oregon halted the merger in two rulings issued within hours of each other.

Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.

But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",https://img.foodmanufacturing.com/files/base/indm/multi/image/2025/03/AP25084614661950.67e411d90e28a.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&rect=0%2C0%2C5385%2C3029&w=1200,N,,2025-03-26 13:05:42.060160

Let's start with Dollar Tree. That stock is up today on the news. It's selling its, uh, family dollar business to two private equity firms. Joining us now with more Yahoo finances Brooke de Palma. I remember when there was a bidding war for Family Dollar and now they're getting rid of it.

Everybody wanted it and Dollar Tree actually won that bidding war against Dollar General. They bought it out for $9 billion and now thinking about what it sold for today, $1 billion to two private equity firms. Investors applauding this move by the company wanting to see Dollar Tree to get rid of family dollar for quite some time. As family dollar really struggled to stay relevant in this time when Amazon and Walmart continue to gain share. CEO Michael Creed told investors on a call this morning, quote, ""I strongly believe dollar, uh, family selling family dollar and returning to our roots with an expanded assortment of dollar tree has created material value. 2025 is going to be a transition year as we pivot to operating Dollar Tree as a standalone entity."" Now, keep in mind this will hit earnings for the full year by roughly 30 cents to 35 cents, but many investors calling this the right strategic move saying that Family Dollar has been a consistent weight on top-line performance, margin rates and management time. We now know the dollar tree will aim to focus on new formats, including these multi-tier offerings, some more prices being offered at stores. And so, certainly, many on the street applauding this move.

And tariffs front and center today again, of course. Um, I'm just wondering Brooke, did Dollar Tree have anything to say about that dynamic?

Yeah, discount retailers dollar stores certainly top of mind within these tariff negotiations, these tariff discussions. They did say they were able to take action to offset 90% of incremental costs for the first round of tariffs. Keep in mind that doesn't include the outlook when thinking about the second round of tariffs. There's some of ways that it was able to mitigate those, include changing items, negotiating with suppliers, eliminating some products entirely, and also, they're really doubling down on that multi-price point offerings. So essentially something that's $2, $3, $5 instead of just that $1 strategy. But, of course, now all eyes on April 2nd as those reciprocal tariffs will come into play here. They then said that they'll have to keep that top of mind and once again use those tools to mitigate that impact yet again.

Yeah, we'll see. Thank you, Brooke.

Further, 48% of McValue consumers said the platform is why they chose McDonald’s over a quick-service peer.
Still, most of the McValue customers were already loyal McDonald’s customers before the launch, meaning the platform isn’t generating many new customers.
Ninety-four percent of McValue buyers visited a McDonald’s restaurant prior to the platform launch, while 90% visited a McDonald’s more than three times in the first half of 2024.
According to Placer.ai data, McDonald’s traffic jumped nearly 9% year-over-year during the week after the McValue platform’s launch, Jan. 13.","The McDonald’s McValue platform, launched in early January, intensified an already cutthroat value environment that began in the middle of 2024 when restaurant brands witnessed their traffic numbers declining. Much of that erosion came from low-income consumers, who have continued to pull back on their discretionary spending. This trend has become a major concern at McDonald’s in particular, given that the company over indexes with lower-income consumers.

So, has the McValue strategy worked so far? In some ways, yes. In other ways, meh.

According to a new report from consumer insights company Numerator, the McValue menu is re-engaging low-income, diverse households looking for an affordable meal. Forty-two percent of McValue consumers said they bought the meal because it offered a low-price deal, for instance, while nearly 30% said it provided options at a variety of price points less than $5. That’s a notch in the positive column for the chain.

Further, 48% of McValue consumers said the platform is why they chose McDonald’s over a quick-service peer. Chains they would have visited instead include Burger King (18%), Chick-fil-A (17%), Wendy’s (14%), and Taco Bell (11%).

Still, most of the McValue customers were already loyal McDonald’s customers before the launch, meaning the platform isn’t generating many new customers. Ninety-four percent of McValue buyers visited a McDonald’s restaurant prior to the platform launch, while 90% visited a McDonald’s more than three times in the first half of 2024.

In other words, Numerator indicates that the McValue menu has driven incremental visits to McDonald’s, while the chain’s peers have lost some trips. But most of those customers were lapsed customers rather than new ones.

The good news is Numerator’s research shows that McValue customers are satisfied with the offering — 91% said they will likely buy off the menu again. Despite that satisfaction, many want to see McDonald’s add even more protein and treat options to the platform. Forty-four percent of category buyers want more burger options, while 35% want more chicken sandwich options, 34% want more breakfast sandwich options, 30% want more sweets and treats, and 26% want more beverage options.

The bad news is the total household penetration for McDonald’s value offers peaked at the end of September 2024, prior to the McValue launch, and has steadily declined since, according to Numerator.

On the traffic side, the picture isn’t much rosier. According to Placer.ai data, McDonald’s traffic jumped nearly 9% year-over-year during the week after the McValue platform’s launch, Jan. 13. Since then, however, traffic has been negative year-over-year at the chain, with some weeks down as much as 8% (Feb. 17). Weather was a major factor for the restaurant industry’s slow performance across much of the country during January and February, but Numerator also notes that McDonald’s has pulled media support for its McValue menu, which could also have an impact. The company is expected to report first quarter results in the coming weeks, which will provide a much fuller picture.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltea7aee2fca050a19/blt1c1aa9ea0e9fa739/67e2df38ffbcf7f7e3f80dee/McValue_Burgers.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-03-26 11:04:43.797198

French tyre major Michelin is seeking continuity in passenger vehicle tyre imports into India till production ramps up at its upcoming Chennai-based plant over the next few years, according to CEO Florent Menegaux. The Clermont-Ferrand-based firm, which reported a revenue of 27.2 billion euro last year, is in talks with the Indian government to extend its import licence for passenger vehicle tyres till the time local production matures in the country.

The company is setting up production capacity for passenger vehicle tyres at its Chennai facility at an investment of Rs 564 crore.

Advt

The plant is expected to commence production later this year with gradual portfolio scale up expected to take place over the next few years.

The local manufacturing would help the company, which has 86 tyre production sites across the globe, to scale up operations in India, which remain subdued with the government introducing import restrictions in 2020.

The tyre maker currently sells only premium bigger size tyres in limited quantity especially for performance-oriented models in India.

In 2020, the government imposed curbs on imports of certain new pneumatic tyres used in motor cars, busses, lorries and motorcycles in a move to promote domestic manufacturing.

Tyre companies can now import only a small number of tyres into the country under a limited import licence, which was not the case before 2020.

Menegaux told PTI here that the company is having extensive discussions with the Indian government to extend import licence.

""We have good relationship with the government, and we are having extensive discussions to extend our licence. We have been granted some licence to import but to grow faster we will need the licence, at least till we have our facility for passenger car ready,"" he stated.

The company has rolled out an investment plan to produce passenger vehicle tyres in the country, but it will take few years till the production touches optimum level, Menegaux stated.

Michelin already has a facility in Chennai for manufacturing a range of radial truck/bus tyres and defence tyres for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as for the replacement market in the country.

The company has invested Rs 2,840 crore on the plant which has an installed production capacity of over 30,000 tonnes per annum.

The facility, which is operational since 2014, caters mainly to Indian market and few export markets.

Besides, Michelin also gets two-wheeler tyres manufactured in the country through a partner.

Menegaux noted that the Indian market has plenty of potential for growth while exhorting the need for a level-playing field for all operators.

""In relationships, I believe in an open world, rules of the games are enforced by countries with a level-playing field. Right now, in India, like many other countries, there is a tendency to look at the world from just the country's (own) perspective,"" Menegaux stated.

""I think this is not adequate. We are citizens of the world, and we should cooperate. I think if we could have more attention towards how do we create a level playing field so that competition can be exercised in proper manner,"" he added.

He noted that India has seen tremendous growth in infrastructure development over the last ten years and the tyre maker sees it an important market globally.

""Like what we have seen in China a few years ago, infrastructure is getting better in India. A lot of investment is taking place in roads and vehicles, etc. So the vehicle parc is expanding,"" he noted.

He further said that Michelin has invested across various segments in India like manufacturing, research and IT services.

""Our core expertise in artificial intelligence comes from India. And so for all of that, India is important to us, and we are making investments,"" Menegaux said.

On a question regarding competition from emerging companies especially from China, Menegaux mentioned that the tyre maker likes competition as it helps it to progress.

""Provided there is acceptable rules of the game, competition strengthens us,"" he added.

""We had one competition from Japan long time back. Then there was one from South Korea and we will have competition from China. We will also have one competitor from India. Maybe you will see one coming from Africa. But that's ok. There is space for everyone as the market grows,"" he stated.

Michelin employs close to 1.3 lakh people globally. The company, which produced around 200 million tyres in 2022, has set a goal of achieving 100 per cent sustainable materials in its tyres by 2050.

The Michelin group aims to become a leader in composite solutions, particularly flexible composites like coated fabrics, films, seals, conveyors, belts, hoses, and inflatable structures.

It operates its composites businesses worldwide under the brands of the Fenner group, which it acquired in 2018.

It took another major step in its development in June 2023, when it acquired the Faitplast, Angeloni, and Orca-Pennel&Flippo brands.

Michelin, as part of a NASA project, plans to leverage its expertise in airless tyres and its knowledge of high-tech materials to design a lunar wheel capable of withstanding extreme temperatures (over 100°C and below -240°C) and solar and galactic radiation.

NASA recently announced that the Moon RACER team, of which Michelin is a member, has been awarded the feasibility study for phase 1 of the ARTEMIS project.

The project, entitled ""Lunar Terrain Vehicle Phase 1 Feasibility Study"", aims to design a lunar vehicle capable of operating in extreme conditions on the moon for 10 years.

Menegaux said the the developments carried out as part of the project will enable Michelin to continue innovating in terrestrial applications.

The Clermont-Ferrand-based firm, which reported a revenue of 27.2 billion euro last year, is in talks with the Indian government to extend its import licence for passenger vehicle tyres till the time local production matures in the country.

The company is setting up production capacity for passenger vehicle tyres at its Chennai facility at an investment of Rs 564 crore.

The plant is expected to commence production later this year with gradual portfolio scale up expected to take place over the next few years.

The local manufacturing would help the company, which has 86 tyre production sites across the globe, to scale up operations in India, which remain subdued with the government introducing import restrictions in 2020.

Bank of America Securities forecasts an 8% decline in domestic package volumes for United Parcel Service in the first quarter of 2025. The projection takes into account strategic internal changes within the business, weather disturbances, and tariff-related uncertainties as well as pressure from these factors.

The expected drop occurs during a larger UPS delivery strategy reconfiguration. A major client whose slow move to in-house logistics has impacted shipping companies, the firm is projected to lose around half of its Amazon (AMZN, Financials) business by mid-2026. UPS is internalizing 50% of its SurePost volumes at the same time, which affects general volume measurements as well as raises average rates.

Bank of America analyst Ken Hoexter reacted by cutting his first quarter earnings per share projection by 15% to $1.31. Based on updated projections for worse operational performance and reduced margins, the 2025 full-year EPS forecast was also reduced by 6% to $7.40.

Although UPS's January performance exceeded expectations, internal data allegedly indicate February and March volume decline. Bank of America reports the firm is not aggressively restructuring costs right now as it sees the weakness as transient.

Now forecast at $643 million in Q1, international adjusted operating income is down from a prior projection of $733 million. Operating margins are predicted to shrink to 15%, down from 17% a year earlier.

Bank of America reaffirmed its Buy recommendation on UPS despite these obstacles, saying long-term faith in the company's capacity to reduce structural expenses as required. Based on a value of 17.5 times expected 2025 profits, the price objective was cut by 3% to $129.",https://static.gurufocus.com/1526208121872130048.jpeg,N,,2025-03-26 10:02:29.034521
