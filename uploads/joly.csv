The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is one of the one of the stocks Jim Cramer was bullish on due to share buyback activity. Cramer said, “we think the world of” the company’s CEO, as he commented:

“Fourth is a bank that I’ve come to like very much over the past couple years, and that’s BNY, the old Bank of New York Mellon. BNY shrunk its share count by 36.2% since the end of 2015, even if the stock wasn’t a real outperformer until more recently. Under CEO Robin Vince, we think the world of him, a Goldman Sachs alum who’s been leading BNY for the past three years or so. The nation’s oldest bank has found new life. They focus on selling their entire suite of financial services to investors rather than marketing this stuff as one-off products. And they’ve also leaned heavily into technology, including AI, maybe the most of all the banks I follow. It’s truly working as the stock’s nearly tripled in a little more than two years.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) provides financial services, including investment management, custody, clearing, and wealth planning. The company also offers banking, trading, and cash management solutions. Cramer mentioned the company during the July 15 episode and remarked:

“This morning, everybody was focused on the numbers from the big banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, but they were also watching the report from BNY, and that’s the old Bank of New York Mellon. This is one of the top custodial banks in America. And this morning, BNY reported another strong quarter with easy top and bottom line beats, not to mention a stunning nearly 28% return on something called tangible common equity. That’s one of the best results I’ve ever seen from a bank. BNY even raised its full-year net interest income forecast with the quarter. Very few did that.”

ID32,Nvidia,2025-12-21 15:02:12+00:00,The Motley Fool,1 Big Reason Why Today's Value Investors Won't Find Tomorrow's Nvidia | The Motley Fool,"Jon Quast, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/20/1-big-reason-why-todays-value-investors-wont-find/,"But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way.
Why value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks.
Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.
Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019.
The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability.","In his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, ""We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant."" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.

Unfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NVDA +3.80%) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.

Yes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.

Why value investors missed Nvidia

Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.

Let's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.

In 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.

The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.

Value investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.

However, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.

How to improve the value mindset

There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, ""Growth is always a component in the calculation of value."" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.

Herein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.

Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.

Nvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.

On a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.

I was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.

The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847355%2Fyoung-man-sitting-pensively-at-his-computer-looking-thoughtfully-at-the-screen-in-front-of-him.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-21 11:01:15.684515

“These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.” In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics.
“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said.
“Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace.
“Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.","Electric two-wheelers will continue to anchor electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India, while passenger cars are set to emerge as the fastest-growing segment from 2026, according to a recent assessment by Capgemini. The consulting firm said strong total cost of ownership benefits, improving charging access and rapid digitisation of vehicles will drive the next phase of EV growth across regions and city tiers.

“Globally, passenger cars will still dominate EV volumes, but in markets like India the deepest penetration will come from two- and three-wheelers and last-mile commercial vehicles,” said Anuraag Bharadwaj, Industry Platform Leader for Automotive – India at Capgemini. “These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.”

In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics. At the same time, passenger EVs are expected to see sharp year-on-year growth as charging infrastructure expands and product options widen across cities.

Beyond the Sale

Technology is also reshaping the two-wheeler segment. Digital display clusters are increasingly mirroring car infotainment systems, offering connected features such as navigation, diagnostics and content playback. Alongside this, software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are beginning to alter OEM business models in India. “OEMs are clearly looking beyond one-time vehicle sales,” Bharadwaj said. “Subscriptions, connected services and feature-led monetisation will become increasingly important revenue streams as consumers become more value-conscious.”

Profitability Gap

However, even as adoption accelerates, Capgemini cautioned that EV profitability in India remains constrained by weak battery localisation. Batteries account for nearly 40% of an EV’s total cost, making them the most expensive component. While localisation has improved in vehicle assembly and electronics integration, domestic battery cell manufacturing remains limited, forcing automakers to rely on imports from China and other markets.

“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said. “Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace. Without a strong domestic ecosystem for cell manufacturing and raw material processing, EV profitability in India will remain structurally constrained.” In the interim, mainstream automakers such as Mahindra are sourcing advanced battery technologies like Blade cells from BYD, a configuration expected in upcoming models including the Maruti eVitara and the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV.

Government incentives under the Production Linked Incentive scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell batteries have triggered gigafactory announcements, but Capgemini said their impact on vehicle costs will be felt only over the medium term. “Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/capgemini.reuters_20250918174936_20251218154439_20251221142311.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-21 11:00:59.375773

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements.
Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing.
A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?
3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls.","Remember when desktop 3D printing felt like the Wild West? A decade ago, anyone with a printer, some filament, and a free weekend could grab models from Thingiverse, tweak a few slicer settings, and let the machine run overnight. The process—and the prints that resulted from it—were chaotic, messy, and often frustrating, but it was also…fun? It felt like the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine, and it was, arguably, glorious.

That free-for-all experimentation era is fading fast, though. In its place? Carefully curated, tightly controlled “walled gardens” where companies make not only the hardware but also the software, the consumables, and the very marketplace where files are shared. It’s the iOS ecosystem, but for 3D printers. And the kicker? While there are protests from the edges, for the most part, it actually works, and people are growing to love it.

Keep Them Coming Back for More

When I was a young engineer starting out, I worked for an automated machinery company that serviced the sewing goods industry. Sewing machines have hundreds of moving parts, and they wear out over time. My employer took me aside once and showed me one of those parts in a spare bin. He rolled it in his hand like a poker chip. The tone in his voice grew somber as he said to me, “See this plate? This costs us $15 to import. We sell it for $400. It wears out, on average, every 4 to 6 months. Always remember: Whenever possible, sell the stapler and the staples.”

He explained to me that for the business to continue running—and to grow and keep everyone employed—the initial purchase of the machinery couldn’t be a customer's only purchase. Parts and supplies like these, with incredibly high markups, were what kept the lights on. A customer who bought a machine from us could spend upward of five to 10 times more than the cost of the machine itself over its lifespan.

Fast-forward to now. I'm no longer hawking sewing machine parts. Instead, I'm writing this story in my home office, where I tinker with and test all sorts of gadgets, including 3D printers. The office is filled with not just printers, but also filament, resin, and spare parts: ""staples,"" from floor to ceiling. Plenty of other hobbyists' and entrepreneurs' home offices look just like mine, which makes you quickly realize the oodles of cash that are up for grabs selling 3D printing accessories.

So it's only natural that the walled gardens of 3D printing are growing taller, as the big players have emerged and dug in. Depending on where you stand, that’s either a long-overdue correction or the beginning of a slow suffocation. A feature, or a fetter.

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing

The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements. If you want to print, you’re encouraged—and sometimes forced—to use only what the company that made your printer sells. This is happening in two universes at the moment: The consumer side, which is what we mostly cover at PCMag, and the professional side, where many American and European companies have found respite from Chinese competitors for the time being.

Compare that to the “open” 3D printing world that I, along with many other pioneering hobbyists, grew up in, and which still exists but is fading rapidly. In that world, you can download models from a dozen free sites, slice them in Cura or PrusaSlicer, and run whatever filament happens to be on sale this week. Need a new gasket for a DIY repair, perhaps? Don't order it from Amazon or even McMaster-Carr. Just print your own on an open-source printer. It’s cheaper, but it’s also messier and more time-consuming.

This phenomenon isn't novel, of course. Printer—paper printer—manufacturers have been pulling this trick for decades by making proprietary ink cartridges. A decade ago, HP tried to block the use of third-party ink via firmware, making you fear bricking your own printer if you tried to use another vendor’s ink. (HP later abandoned this effort, at least in part.) Apple’s App Store lives on the same principle. I can’t share songs I purchase on my Android phone with my wife, who is browsing the iTunes store next to me as I write this.

The difference, though, is that in 3D printing, the stakes involve not just money but reliability, safety, and speed—things that can make or break a newbie’s first impression.

Why Companies Are Raising the Walls

If you’re wondering why companies are doubling down on lock-ins and gathering as many customers as they can into their respective gardens, the answer is simple: control.

Support Costs Drop When You Control Every Variable

Think about it from the company's perspective: Fewer random filaments means fewer angry customers sending failed print photos to your support team—the “Why is this piece of junk not working?” tickets. It also means fewer nozzles you have to ship out, at your cost, to keep their flaming fingers out of the forums and Facebook groups long enough to get them past the jam they caused with bargain-basement filament.

Safety Improves When Resins and Filaments Are Vetted

Fewer toxic fumes mean fewer mechanical misfires. Formlabs, maker of the Form 4 I recently reviewed, claims to have eliminated the dangerous VOCs found in many resins and uses ISO certification in its resins and other ancillary products to maintain consistency. The Form 4 is therefore a favorite of pros who know exactly why things like tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation, and heat deflection are critical.

Performance Is More Consistent

Tuned profiles mean smoother prints and fewer headaches. When I was coming up in the hobby, it was assumed that you were always tweaking and adjusting; printing calibration cubes, Benchies, and temperature towers. If you didn’t know how to do those things, you were a newbie to be pitied, and most of your prints probably failed.

Those days are long gone. I recently tested the Bambu Lab H2S, which not only comes with pre-tuned slicer settings for every Bambu Lab filament but also includes equivalent settings for nearly every major filament supplier. I tested both, with flawless results and no tuning or futzing required.

Recurring Revenue From Accessories Keeps the Lights On

Printers are often sold at razor-thin margins; filament and resin make up the difference. Here's some napkin math: Assuming we’re talking about a larger brand, the gross margin on filament sales is somewhere between 40% and 70%. The net margin on 3D printers, on the other hand (after all costs and overhead), is maybe 20% or 25%. When you buy a $1,500 printer, the company makes $300 in profits. Assuming you use 50 spools of filament a year per printer, that’s another $500 per year for the life of the machine. Keeping you in the garden is good for business.

Data Loops Build Better Machines

Telemetry on what succeeds and fails feeds back into better slicers, better defaults, and tighter ecosystems. Web-connected slicers like Bambu Studio bring files offsite to a cloud server and back again, which has me concerned about possible IP theft, but let's face it: If Bambu Lab knows all about the file you were printing in a machine that can measure (via cameras and sensors) how the print went, it can learn from failed prints. Tesla monitors all the data from cars using its Full Self-Driving feature to improve the AI that makes driving decisions, and 3D printer companies can take a similar approach. Instead of telemetry data and speeds, it’s g-code and video. No one I’ve ever met who owns a Tesla is mad that their driving data goes back to the corporation, because they know it’s improving their experience. Data loops within the walled garden perform the same function.

If you were raised like me, printing your 3D bits from USB keys instead of via a web app, this can be a hard leap to make. But let's not forget that life outside the garden isn't free from data-sharing pitfalls, either. In 2021, a Thingiverse data breach potentially exposed data from hundreds of thousands of users.

The Upside for Users

Let’s be honest: most people don’t want to fiddle with firmware, PID tuning, or slicer voodoo. They want the print to work the first time. Walled gardens are delivering that in spades. People are loyal to their brands as a result, with the term “fanboy” tossed around more frequently than ever. If you are a Prusa, Bambu Lab, or Creality convert, you know that the energy in those forums is akin to football fans arguing over which team is going to win the Super Bowl this year. And fandom has its concrete benefits.

First-Print Success Rates Skyrocket

A beginner can unbox, click Print, and hold a finished part hours later. I’ve met people who’ve never had a first-layer issue, while back in the day, I would spend hours fighting with my Creality Ender 3, invoking all sorts of remedies, including hairspray, glue sticks, and prayers to whatever deity was listening, to get to the second layer.

Time Savings Are Real

No more spending 3 hours browsing a forum thread to fix a stringing issue: The maker world moves faster than it ever has. I met three vendors at a maker festival in September who cumulatively had about 500 articulated figurines for sale: $5 for three. These people earn their living from these fairs and don’t have time to spare fixing things.

Quality Is Better

Tuned profiles and real-time monitoring reduce the likelihood of failure. I recently had a client come to me asking to reverse-engineer the transparent dome light on his cooking range. The manufacturer didn’t make replacement parts, and so I scanned it and printed it with the Form 4 using Formlabs' Transparent V3 resin, which I know to be dimensionally accurate. The part measured 2.95 inches wide (75.05mm, to be exact), and it was a perfect fit.

I happily pay more for the resin, knowing I can take on those types of jobs and produce an engineered replacement that measures up to what I designed in my CAD software. There's no Wild West aspect, so the experience isn't a nail-biter, but I get great prints with pre-tuned dimensional accuracy.

Safety

Certified materials and built-in interlocks aren’t just marketing; they prevent accidents. When I load the 10-watt laser module into the Bambu Lab H2S and go to cut a part from 3mm-thick birchboard, there’s a QR code sticker in the corner that tells the cutter exactly what material I’m using. It knows what power levels to use and how fast to move the laser through the wood—all the things it needs to avoid setting the board on fire and burning my house down. I trust that over my late-night intuition just before I go to bed, with best guesses driving my g-code. I’ll pay more for that, as will most people, especially when I first start working with new materials I’m unfamiliar with.

The Downsides

Of course, just like an actual wall, the walled-garden approach has multiple sides, and there are plenty of negative ones.

Costs Creep Upward

Proprietary filaments and resins cost more, and some companies use DRM chips to prevent you from using third-party resin. It can get even more extreme than that: The Form 4 and other Formlabs printers prevent owners from using whatever resin they want in their machines unless they pay hefty unlocking fees.

Innovation Slows

When companies dictate what’s allowed, experimental materials and techniques get buried. Once a company can build a large enough user base, it controls the pace of development, as opposed to the early days when innovation leaps were required to punch through into the market.

It takes a ""black swan"" innovator to force everyone with a walled garden to catch up quickly. I believe we’re seeing this now with Snapmaker’s U1 multi-toolhead printer, which has raised more than $20.6 million on Kickstarter at this writing. Bambu Lab is now attempting to compete with its upcoming Vortek tool-changing accessory.

Marketplaces Gatekeep

File visibility isn’t always merit-based; it’s algorithmic. That means the best designs don’t always win—the best thumbnails do. When you control the keys to the kingdom, you control what files people are potentially printing on your machines.

Data Is Extracted

Every print you slice in the cloud reveals information about you, your projects, and your habits to the vendor. Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing. The larger the garden and the more dependent users are on it compounds the possibility of theft or hacking. There’s a tremendous element of trust involved.

Longevity Questions Loom

What happens if the company shuts down its servers or moves on from your model of printer? Suddenly, your “ecosystem” is a paperweight. This has plenty of precedent, too: Google recently discontinued the smart features of older Nest thermostats.

The only company currently providing a robust path forward for upgrades is Prusa, which is arguably being left behind in terms of features as a result. While you can turn a Prusa MK3 or MK4 into a Core One, the Core One simply doesn’t compare to an H2D or H2S, Bambu Lab’s latest models.

A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing

Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?

Prusa printers are arguably the most un-walled mainstream printers out there. The company's Printables is free and open-source, though it lacks the same monetized incentive structure of Bambu Lab's MakerWorld.

Formlabs is mostly closed. Its resin and software ecosystem is locked tight, but its users largely accept it because the quality is unmatched, with dimensionally tuned and accurate outputs. Want your parts to fit together properly? You need Formlabs resin.

Stratasys has always been closed. For enterprise buyers, that’s the point: certifications, compliance, security, and contracts matter more than tinkering. Like Formlabs, Stratasys—and subsidiaries like Ultimaker—have largely retreated to the educational and professional space, with a dwindling number of consumer models available.

Elegoo, Anycubic, Qidi, and Creality occupy a fuzzier space. They've largely been open, but are moving toward curated slicers and marketplaces. Everyone sees where the market is headed, and no one wants to be left behind. Each of these companies has its own filament and resin lines, with virtually every possible color and polymer available, and “pre-tuned” slicer settings in Cura or Orca to get you started quickly without fiddling.

So, should you buy into one of these gardens? It depends on what you want.

If you prioritize reliability, enter the garden. You’ll spend more, but you’ll save time and frustration. If someone were to ask me what a good first 3D printer to buy is, and I wanted them to have the easiest setup and most enjoyable experience, I would drop them off from a theoretical helicopter directly into the middle of Bambu Lab’s garden.

If you love tinkering, stay outside. Cheap filament, third-party slicers, wild mods—the Wild West is disappearing, but it's not gone. If I were on a spaceship that needed to survive a 100-year mission, I would bring a Prusa with me, along with 10,000 rolls of Prusament. Blessed are the tinkerers, and they all wear black-and-orange shirts.

If you have the space and budget for two printers, buy one of each. Use the polished ecosystem for mission-critical prints, and reserve the tinkerer’s machine for experiments with unconventional filaments and techniques. My LulzBot TAZ 5 has been printing for 10 years now. I can put any filament I want into it (I create a makeshift heated chamber by throwing an emergency blanket over it) and keep the earliest phases of my IP private in my office. Just keep your eyes open for red flags: consumables with DRM, printers that function only via cloud slicing, or companies with a history of abandoning products.

What Will the Walled Garden of the Future Bring?

I’d bet on more walls, not fewer. Expect:

Creator subscriptions and “pro” packs. This seems inevitable to me. Platforms like MakerWorld will become more like Spotify, and designers will rise as a result.

Smarter, telemetry-driven auto-profiles. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, it’s hard to envision a world where it isn’t embedded in a machine's ROM to monitor prints via sensors and cameras.

Partially walled gardens, in which vendors still allow escape hatches but prefer you don’t use them. Bambu Lab and Formlabs provide exit hatches for third-party filaments and resins, and I suppose see the necessity of a door in and out of the garden.

Lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. If it’s illegal for HP to stop people from loading third-party ink cartridges, as some customers have (so far unsuccessfully) argued in court, it’s inevitable that regulation will catch up to what is arguably an analogous situation with 3D printers.

(Credit: Michael Lydick)

The genie’s out of the bottle. 3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls. The walled gardens of 3D printing aren’t inherently evil. In many cases, they make the tech more reliable, safer, and far more approachable for the average hobbyist. Without them, adoption would stall.

But make no mistake: Every convenience comes at a cost. If you step into a garden, know the price of admission, and know that the gate may not always stay open. The best gardens don’t just protect the company—they protect the users and the creators, too.

If vendors get that balance right, maybe a wall doesn’t have to feel like a prison. Maybe it can feel like an amusement park—curated, safe, and pleasant, but just exciting enough to be worth wandering into.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05w23Zdc93miv2kx7tU2mqh-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1766003609.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 08:59:52.091490

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.","Stalling growth, sticky inflation and fragile bond markets, the UK’s economic record in 2025 has hardly been one to inspire cheer. But in the spirit of the festive season, here are a few reasons to hope for a happier new year.

The first is that, barring external forces, 2026 should not involve a repeat of this year’s fiscal drama.

Rachel Reeves more than doubled the margin of error, or headroom, against her fiscal rules at last month’s budget, and that should gift the Treasury a quieter 2026.

The chancellor’s spring statement should be a non-event for another reason, too: she announced that while the Office for Budget Responsibility will still carry out a forecast, it will not formally assess her against the rules.

So as some wise men – and women – advised her to do last year, even if there has been a marked deterioration in the outlook, Reeves intends to stand firm until the autumn budget. That would mark a welcome contrast with the tax and spend saga of the past year (though if Labour MPs choose to change the top team in Downing Street, the drama would be very much back on).

A second reason for optimism is that after a gloomy year, recent surveys have included glimmers of hope.

Official figures show Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank in October. But the snapshot is backward-looking, assessing how activity had fared through the rear-view mirror. The latest flash purchasing managers index for December, published by data provider S&P Global, suggests things could be improving. The reading on its monthly index jumped to 52.1, from 51.2 in November – with 50 marking the divide between growth and contraction.

In the private sector, S&P said, “the rise in new business was the strongest for 14 months and mainly reflected a solid improvement in demand across the service economy”.

It would make sense that if, as many business groups have claimed, the chaotic budget buildup killed confidence, we should get a modest uptick in activity now that it is over.

Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says that chimes with what he is hearing from member companies.

“There was a general sense that things got quite a lot better from the first week of September, and October, then the brakes went on a little bit in November, because of pre-budget chat.”

He adds: “[Hiring] won’t come back this month because it’s December, but quite a few people are quite hopeful about what comes through in January and February.”

A third source of optimism is the hope that consumers could respond positively to the latest Bank of England rate cut, the government’s £150-a-year energy bills relief package, and an end to months of tedious speculation over tax.

There are plenty of reasons for caution here. Not least a reluctance at the Bank to cut rates much further, despite weakness in the labour market.

But if cheaper mortgages and energy bills do help to ease the squeeze, and – whisper it – restore a bit of feelgood factor, the evidence suggests some consumers could have some financial capacity to respond.

The household savings rate – the share of income workers put away for a rainy day – has jumped to well above the long-run average since the Covid pandemic. In the second quarter of this year, it was running at 10.7% – about 2.5 percentage points higher than the 1987-2019 average.

Analysis by Michael Saunders, a former Bank rate setter, now of the consultancy Oxford Economics, suggests a heightened sense of financial insecurity is one explanation. After the jarring shock of Covid shutdowns, the energy price spike, and soaring interest rates, that would make sense.

He is concerned this higher propensity to save could “cap consumer spending growth” for some time to come, dampening the economic recovery. But viewed in a festive spirit of optimism, it does indicate a capacity for some households to loosen their belts a little, if the mood should take them.

The fourth reason for hope is even more tentative, but potentially significant: recent productivity data has been improving.

In what Andrew Wishart of Berenberg bank called recently “the good news story of the year”, the key measure of economic output per worker (vital for lifting wages and living standards) rose by 1% in the first half of 2025. This puts productivity “on course to record one of its better years since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009”.

In some labour-intensive sectors, where there have been job cuts following Reeves’s changes to employer national insurance contributions (NICs), that is little more than a mathematical effect – fewer workers for a given level of GDP means more output per worker.

But Wishart’s early analysis also suggests productivity gains in other sectors, including IT. “We could plausibly be witnessing the beginnings of a boost from artificial intelligence,” he argues.

As Reeves’s former chief economic adviser, the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenen has long argued, UK businesses have tended to underinvest in technology and innovation, leaning instead on the plentiful supply of cheap workers.

Part of the largely unspoken logic of raising the minimum wage and employer NICs – which drove up the cost of hiring – was to tip the balance towards productivity-enhancing investment and innovation, which should be good for growth. Much, though, depends on the labour market’s capacity to re-absorb the workers laid-off in the process.

Lower interest rates from the Bank would help here, plus there are some indications that wage inflation is falling away. That could perhaps open the door to more rapid reductions.

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.

Parker-Hannifin Investment Narrative Recap

To own Parker Hannifin, you need to believe it can keep compounding earnings through a mix of industrial recovery, aerospace strength and disciplined capital allocation, even as growth expectations moderate.

Against this backdrop, the board’s decision to lift the quarterly dividend by 10% to US$1.80 per share in April 2025 and then maintain that level through late 2025 stands out as an important signal about cash generation and balance sheet comfort. For investors watching analyst optimism, those steady payout decisions help frame whether the current earnings and margin momentum can support both shareholder returns and the higher valuation the stock now carries.

Yet, even with this supportive backdrop, investors should be aware that Parker Hannifin’s increasing reliance on aerospace and longer cycle defense revenue could...

Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$668 to US$908, showing how far apart individual views on Parker Hannifin can sit.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.
Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said.
Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.","BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- As the number of skilled tradespeople dwindles in the United States, Walmart is trying to build up its own workforce to keep conveyor belts moving, refrigerated grocery cases cold, and drains and parking lots flowing.

The nation's largest retailer and private employer revamped its training program last year to increase the pipeline of maintenance technicians who do everything from repair equipment to electrical work at Walmart's distribution centers and stores -- jobs that have become increasingly difficult to fill because of a shrinking labor pool.

The shortage has opened opportunities for people like Liz Cardenas, 24, who started at Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution center in Lancaster, Texas, making sure boxes were securely taped and went through a conveyer belt upright. Today, she is responsible for fixing conveyor belts and other equipment when they break at distribution centers.

Cardenas, who nearly doubled her hourly pay to $43.50 per hour, said she plans to pursue more training, which will mean an even higher salary and more responsibility. It also means financial freedom.

""I was able to move out of my parents' house,"" she said. ""I have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and and I'm able to give more to my 401(k).""

A surge of retirements, along with a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic but now is accelerating with President Donald Trump's aggressive deportations, are among the main factors behind labor shortages that bedevil some employers, analysts say.

But in skilled trades, the problem is even more acute. Consulting firm McKinsey analyzed 12 types of trade job categories, including maintenance technicians, welders, and carpenters, and predicted an estimated imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee from 2022 to 2032.

McKinsey noted ""the extraordinary rate of churn"" could cost companies more than $5.3 billion every year in talent acquisition and training costs alone.

The shortages are happening as some companies are also laying off workers amid rising operational costs from new tariffs, shifting consumer spending and increased spending on artificial intelligence.

Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from roughly 150 companies representing millions of employees nationwide, launched in June a new initiative to address worker shortages in skilled trades, including maintenance technicians. The initiative, co-championed by home improvement retailer Lowe's, entails working with elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.

For its part, Lowe's in 2022 started a 90-day online training program for employees who want to pursue jobs like carpentry and utility maintenance. Separately, its charitable arm has invested $43 million since 2023 to 60 organizations including technical colleges and non-profit groups to help recruit and train skilled tradespeople like maintenance technicians and plumbers.

Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas's Walton College of Business in Fayetteville, Arkansas, noted these programs will help ease the shortages, but they won't eliminate the gap, particularly given Trump's clampdown on immigration.

""For as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist, even though on the margins it'll mitigate some of the shortage,"" he said. ""We don't have enough people.""

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told The Associated Press he believes part of the reason for the shortages is ""lack of awareness.""

""I think most Americans probably don't know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech,"" he said. ""So we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.""

Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This year, it added new training sites in Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The initiative combines hands-on instruction and classroom learning in fields like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical work, and general maintenance.

As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said. With its first class of 108 associates who completed the Dallas/Fort Worth pilot program, every graduate secured a technician role, putting them on a path to earn an average of $32 per hour. Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.

R.J. Zanes, vice president of facility services for the U.S. divisions of Walmart and Sam's Club, said Walmart was able to attract workers from all over the country with different backgrounds, including employees running cash registers.

Maintenance technician roles are crucial to keeping Walmart's operations running smoothly, but especially so during the holiday season. For example, if a refrigeration system goes down within a Walmart store, it could cost up to $300,000 to $400,000 worth of lost product, according to Zanes.

""We've got to stay out in front of that,"" he said. ""We have to ensure that we've got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance, and when we do have a breakdown, to make sure that we get it back up as fast as possible to minimize that cost of downtime.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211816062_211816062-a2007b0fbd79460395fc47bc9686049a_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-12-21 06:59:43.031371

The mood is cautiously optimistic: the bulls still control the longer term trend, but the latest sessions show a market that is far more selective and sensitive to every new data point.

Live updates, products and investor resources on Adobe Inc. stock

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought Adobe Inc. stock roughly a year ago and simply held on would today be sitting on an impressive gain, in the region of 25 to 35 percent depending on the exact entry point. That outperformance towers over the broader market and highlights how decisively the company has convinced Wall Street that its AI push and subscription engine can keep delivering double digit earnings growth. Yet that very success now fuels the main risk: sentiment has swung from skepticism to high expectations, which leaves less room for error if growth even slightly disappoints.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, traders continued to digest Adobe’s most recent earnings update, where the company once again demonstrated resilient demand in its core Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses. Management leaned heavily into the narrative that Firefly and other AI features are already driving higher engagement and willing-to-pay among professional users, a message that resonated with growth-focused investors.

Over the past several days, commentary has also circled back to competitive pressure from both traditional rivals and new AI-native tools, particularly those from big tech platforms and upstart design apps. While there have been no shocking negative headlines, the market has treated even small hints of pricing scrutiny or slower enterprise deal cycles as a reason to lock in profits, contributing to a choppy, consolidation-style trading pattern following the earlier surge.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street research desks remain broadly constructive on Adobe. Analysts at major houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs still frame the shares as a Buy, with price targets that typically imply upside in the low double digits from current levels. Others, including more valuation-focused firms like Bank of America and JPMorgan, have tended toward a more balanced stance, often at Overweight or Neutral, arguing that while the long term AI monetization story is compelling, the stock already discounts much of that growth. Taken together, the consensus skews positive but not euphoric: Adobe is widely viewed as a core quality holding in software, yet its premium multiple leaves little tolerance for execution missteps.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Adobe’s business model rests on deeply embedded creative and document software, sold almost entirely via recurring cloud subscriptions and increasingly enhanced with proprietary generative AI. The company’s next leg of performance will depend on three levers: how convincingly it can upsell AI features across its large installed base, whether it can maintain pricing power in the face of new low cost rivals, and how effectively it expands deeper into marketing and experience software for large enterprises. If management executes on that strategy and macro conditions remain stable, the stock has room to grind higher from consolidation, but any sign that AI monetization is slower than promised could quickly shift today’s cautious optimism back toward a more critical, valuation-driven reset.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405044_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:59:41.614629

A series of images shared on X highlighted how the SHANTI Bill 2025 promotes greater international cooperation by strengthening India's commitment to global best practices and international commitments, and by opening doors to developing reactors through international cooperation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that the passing of the SHANTI Bill by both Houses of Parliament marks a transformational moment for India's technology landscape and delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country.

In a post on X, PM Modi said the bill also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth.

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, 2025 (SHANTI Bill).The Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha a day after it got approval in the Lok Sabha.

In his reply to the debate, Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh sought to allay opposition members' apprehensions and said the safety aspect has not been diluted.

The bill seeks to repeal the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010.

Jitendra Singh said the new legislation is aligned to achieve the objectives of increasing the share of nuclear energy in the total energy mix of India, will facilitate innovation in atomic science and technology, expand its applications to non-power applications and continue to honour India's obligations towards safety, security, safeguards and towards nuclear liability.

India has set an ambitious target to achieve energy independence, with a roadmap to decarbonise the economy by 2070 and to reach 100 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity by 2047.

The bill seeks to leverage the contribution of domestic nuclear energy to augment the global nuclear energy ecosystem.

Opposition members strongly demanded that the bill be referred to the standing or select committee, noting that it has wide-ranging implications and will have a lasting impact. They alleged that the government had diluted the liability clause and asked whether it was bringing the bill under any pressure. The amendments moved by the opposition members were negatived.

It went so 'wild' that the Nvidia CEO had to issue a clarification. During a fireside chat at the Center for Strategic and International Studies this month, Huang directly spoke about his statement on Chinese AI dominance vs America's. CSIS President John Hamre asked Huang what he termed ""very provocative"": You said something recently that was quite provocative. You said that China was winning the AI race, the AI competition. I know that you've got a powerful competitor in Huawei, and Huawei has a lot of advantages you don't have. Why don't you describe this competition? Are we really losing? In his reply to Hamre, Huang said, ""And it apparently caught a lot of attention. As you know with headlines, the disclaimer part, the foundation part was left out of the headline. But the way to think about that is that let me just handicap it right now. If you look at AI and go back to the first thing that we said, AI is a five layer cake. Let's just always simplify it. It's not quite this simplistic, but let's simplify AI into a five layer cake. Energy, chips, infrastructure, models, and applications. And let's handicap it from bottom to top. At the lowest level, China has twice the amount of energy we have as a nation.""

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

China dominance in Energy is one of the 'deal breakers'

""Twice as much energy as we have as a nation. And our economy's larger than theirs. Makes no sense to me. We also know that one of the most important initiatives, one of the most important policies of this administration. And there was the first thing that President Trump said to me when we met: ""Listen, we need to reindustrialize America. We need to do onshore manufacturing again. We need to help America make things again. "" It's going to create jobs. That part of the economy has been offshore and completely gutted the United States. We need to bring that back and he needs my help to do so. And so, that entire sector of the economy is missing,"" Nvidia CEO went on to add. Then Huang added the energy problem that America is facing, where China is miles ahead. While talking about the same Huang did give a compliment to President Trump, saying that he is trying his best to solve the problem. ""And however, without energy, how do we build chip plants, computer system plants, and these AI data centers? We call them AI factories. We're simultaneously building three different types of factories in the United States. Chip factories, super computer factories, and AI factories, they all require energy, every single one of them. And so on, the one hand, we want to reindustrialize the United States. How do you do that without energy? And so, the fact that we vilified energy for so long, President Trump sticking his neck out, and taking it on the chin, and helping the country realize that energy is necessary for our growth, is really one of the greatest things he's done right off the bat,"" Huang said.

America is generations ahead in Chips

He said that while America is 50% of China in energy, the country is generationals ahead in Chips. But at the same time warned that the country cannot afford to be complacent. As semiconductors is a manufacturing process and anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea. ""And so, now at the energy level, back to that stack, we're 50% and they're growing straight up. We're kind of flat right now. And so, number one, energy. Number two, chips. We're generations ahead. We are generations ahead on chips, and I think everybody recognizes that. Number three, infrastructure. If you want to build a data center here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital on a weekend. That's a real challenge. And so, at the infrastructure layer, their velocity of building things, because they are builders. Their velocity of building things is extraordinarily high. Now, really quickly on chips. We're several generations ahead, but don't be complacent. Remember, semiconductors are a manufacturing process. Anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea,"" Hunag said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's ‘China will win the AI race’ remark

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told the Financial Times in November this year that “China is going to win the AI race,” only to release a clarification statement soon after. Huang was speaking on the sidelines of the FT’s Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the US in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations. However, several hours after the FT published its report, Nvidia issued a separate statement from Jensen on an official X account. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,” he added.

In the 2010s, tech companies chased staff-level specialists: Backend engineers, data scientists, system architects. That model worked when technology evolved slowly. Specialists knew their craft, could deliver quickly and built careers on predictable foundations like cloud infrastructure or the latest JS framework

Then AI went mainstream.

The pace of change has exploded. New technologies appear and mature in less than a year. You can’t hire someone who has been building AI agents for five years, as the technology hasn’t existed for that long. The people thriving today aren’t those with the longest résumés; they’re the ones who learn fast, adapt fast and act without waiting for direction. Nowhere is this transformation more evident than in software engineering, which has likely experienced the most dramatic shift of all, evolving faster than almost any other field of work.

How AI Is rewriting the rules

AI has lowered the barrier to doing complex technical work, technical skills and it's also raised expectations for what counts as real expertise. McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated and 12 million workers may need to shift roles entirely. Technical depth still matters, but AI favors people who can figure things out as they go.

At my company, I see this every day. Engineers who never touched front-end code are now building UIs, while front-end developers are moving into back-end work. The technology keeps getting easier to use but the problems are harder because they span more disciplines.

In that kind of environment, being great at one thing isn’t enough. What matters is the ability to bridge engineering, product and operations to make good decisions quickly, even with imperfect information.

Despite all the excitement, only 1% of companies consider themselves truly mature in how they use AI. Many still rely on structures built for a slower era — layers of approval, rigid roles and an overreliance on specialists who can’t move outside their lane.

The traits of a strong generalist

A strong generalist has breadth without losing depth. They go deep in one or two domains but stay fluent across many. As David Epstein puts it in Range, “You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning.” True expertise comes from connecting the dots, not just collecting information.

The best generalists share these traits:

Ownership: End-to-end accountability for outcomes, not just tasks.

First-principles thinking: Question assumptions, focus on the goal, and rebuild when needed.

Adaptability: Learn new domains quickly and move between them smoothly.

Agency: Act without waiting for approval and adjust as new information comes in.

Soft skills: Communicate clearly, align teams and keep customers’ needs in focus.

Range: Solve different kinds of problems and draw lessons across contexts.

I try to make accountability a priority for my teams. Everyone knows what they own, what success looks like and how it connects to the mission. Perfection isn’t the goal, forward movement is.

Embracing the shift

Focusing on adaptable builders changed everything. These are the people with the range and curiosity to use AI tools to learn quickly and execute confidently.

If you’re a builder who thrives in ambiguity, this is your time. The AI era rewards curiosity and initiative more than credentials. If you’re hiring, look ahead. The people who’ll move your company forward might not be the ones with the perfect résumé for the job. They’re the ones who can grow into what the company will need as it evolves.

The future belongs to generalists and to the companies that trust them.

What is Uber One?

Uber promoted its subscription UberOne, with a monthly cost of $9.99, as a way to save on travel and deliveries, ensuring that people could cancel it at any time.

However, the company misled users about the supposed savings and made the cancellation process considerably more difficult.

In some cases, people had to go through as much as 23 screens, perform 32 shares and wait for a response from a customer service representative to cancel the subscription.

Sometimes, Uber staff's delayed response resulted in the cancellation not being completed on time and another monthly charge being applied.

Despite offering a free trial period, Uber made automatic charges when users were unable to overcome these barriers, and even charged some people. before of the expected payment date.

In a spectacular showcase of triumph, Ducati recently celebrated yet another stellar season at their headquarters in Borgo Panigale during the ‘Campioni in Festa’ event. With Marc Márquez clinching his fourth consecutive title, Ducati solidifies its standing as the powerhouse of MotoGP, boasting a staggering six constructors’ championships. However, as the current regulatory era draws to a close, the racing landscape is set for an explosive transformation come 2027.

With an incredible 17 victories under their belt in 2025 alone, Ducati’s Desmosedici remains the benchmark as we gear up for the 2026 season. But the big question looms: will this dominance continue when the rules shift dramatically? The transition to 850cc engines, alongside significant aerodynamic restrictions and the ban on height devices, could spell trouble for the Italian giants. To further complicate matters, Pirelli tires will replace the long-standing Michelin, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to the upcoming championships.

Claudio Domenicali, Ducati’s CEO, has been vocal about the challenges ahead. “Unfortunately, some innovations that Ducati pioneered are being phased out of the regulations, like height devices and wings. From a regulatory and political standpoint, there are efforts to simplify the rules to prevent Ducati from creating any more groundbreaking technology. Nevertheless, our engineers are incredibly astute. We will have simpler bikes with fewer adjustments available, so we will see who can best navigate this new landscape,” Domenicali stated, highlighting the fierce competition that lies ahead.

As we set our sights on 2027, the rider market is heating up, with all major contracts expiring at the end of 2026. Márquez, undoubtedly the most coveted rider, is set to hit the market, creating a buzz of speculation. “Marc will be available, and naturally, that will be a topic of discussion. He’s been fantastic for us, and we for him, but everything is still to be evaluated. The same goes for Pecco Bagnaia, who has been with us for a considerable time. The market is open to all, but it’s too early to make any moves. I anticipate that the action will pick up around February or March,” Domenicali elaborated.

While there have been instances in the past where major signings occurred before the season kicked off, Domenicali cautions that it’s not always straightforward. “It’s not always that simple; it depends on the timing. Sometimes deals can be struck, and other times they cannot. There is a mutual will to collaborate, but it’s still a bit premature, and not all elements are in place for a smooth transition,” he commented.

Looking ahead, Ducati is also nurturing young talent like Fermín Aldeguer, but the primary focus remains on retaining the legendary #93. “Our philosophy is to support the growth of young riders, just as we did with Pecco and Jorge Martín, while also considering Aldeguer. At the same time, we are open to all possibilities, including Marc this year,” Domenicali affirmed.

As Ducati prepares for a new era in MotoGP, the stakes have never been higher. Will they maintain their grip on the championship, or will the new regulations pave the way for a shocking upset? One thing is for sure: the race to 2027 promises to be a thrilling spectacle!",https://motorcyclesports.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marc-Marquez.webp,N,,2025-12-21 07:59:30.221552

Chaos Erupts On Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 As ‘Hallucinating’ Passenger Tries To Open Emergency Exit At 39,000 Feet

On a recent Alaska Airlines flight, a passenger started hallucinating and understandably panicking when he thought the plane had lost its wings and that meth was coming out of the air vents. He had been talking to himself and showing signs of panic and aggravation throughout the flight. Then, when he attempted to open the emergency exit door mid-flight, it took 3 people to stop him. This is obviously a serious offense which could get him up to 20 years in prison, but the passenger was also obviously not in his right senses. Apparently, when medical examiners saw him upon landing, he told them he had been drinking for the last 10 days, had been hearing and seeing things, and was also on antidepressants. This reminds me just a bit of the time an Alaska Airlines pilot got high on psychedelic mushrooms and tried to turn the engines off mid-flight.

Uber could face billions in penalties across US after ‘deceptive billing and cancellation practices’

Uber is facing steep penalties for a myriad of issues, including making it confusing and difficult to cancel Uber One subscriptions, among other things. Some Uber customers said they had to go through more than 30 different “actions” across 23 different screens just to cancel their subscription! In this day of one-click functions, 30 actions is beyond frustrating. Customers also complained that the claims of how much savings they’d see with the Uber One membership were ultimately misleading, that discounts never showed up, that they were enrolled in Uber One without knowing it, or that fees kicked in before their free trials were even completed. Uber has many issues to address (or pay for) here.

10 amazing experiences in Northern Ireland

So many travel to Ireland, but Northern Ireland gets, I think, unfairly missed. The culture is magnetic and authentic to its core, and the terrain is both harsh and beautiful. In college, I spent two different semesters living abroad in Derry, Northern Ireland, where I got to do quite a lot of adventuring with local friends. In fact, the #5 recommendation on this list, “Walk 17th century walls,” features the 400+ year old wall that surrounds Derry, which I crossed nearly every day as I’d walk downtown to the chip shop or shopping center. And of course, Derry has a plethora of murals which tell the complex and emotional story of “the troubles” in the 60’s and beyond. (I lived just up the street from these murals, in fact.) But the most obvious recommendation on the list, at least for more light-hearted tourism, is the Causeway Coastal Route, where you can see both the bizarre hexagonal geography of the Giant’s Causeway and the adorably fairy-tale (yet also terrifyingly high) Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge. The Glens of Antrim will also give you the perfect, lush green fairytale landscapes you dream of with a trip to Ireland, so consider adding a few stops in Northern Ireland as well.

Skip The Crowds At Zion’s Narrows For This Equally Scenic Slot Canyon That’s A Day Trip From Las Vegas

My experience at the Narrows at Zion National Park was actually less inundated with crowds than is typical because I was there close to dusk when most (more safety-conscious and wise hikers) were already heading back to dry land. But it’s become one of the go-to hikes in Zion and, like Angel’s Landing, the crowds show it. I am always interested in a “try this instead of this” article if I think it could save me an overcrowded experience where I’m fighting through droves of tourists to snap a picture or catch a view. While I can’t vouch for this suggestion myself, I can vouch for the fact that Utah is absolutely littered with beautiful hikes and slot canyons, which don’t seem to attract more than a handful of visitors. So it doesn’t surprise me at all that a place like this would be both lesser-known and worthy of a visit. This hike is just 4 miles round-trip, but is described as somewhat challenging. Personally, when I’m in Utah, “somewhat challenging” is kind of what I’m looking for. Has anyone been to this spot to attest to its “off-the-beaten-path” nature?",https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/panic-inflight-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 20:58:46.586516

Until recently, discharge petitions were sparsely employed.
The Johnson-era discharge petitions similarly show he has less than an iron fist.
Sponsored by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was joined by four House Republicans frustrated with Johnson’s refusal to allow any sort of vote on the subsidies.
You can argue that the sudden frequency of discharge petitions in Johnson’s House is mostly the product of exceptionally narrow party control (at present, the Republicans have just a three-vote majority).","For well over a century, the U.S. House has been a legislative chamber tightly controlled by its leaders. Unlike members of the Senate, House representatives have no automatic right to offer amendments to bills. The leadership-controlled Rules Committee has to certify access to the House floor for votes, plus all amendments. The Speaker’s leadership team controls all committee assignments, which aren’t as completely bound by seniority as they are in the Senate. And there’s no device like the Senate filibuster available in the House to empower minorities to block (and, in many cases, help shape) majority-backed legislation. Enhanced over the decades by especially powerful Speakers, ranging from the late 19th century’s Thomas B. “Czar” Reed to the early 21st century’s Nancy Pelosi, the so-called People’s House hasn’t been run in a particularly democratic manner, except to the extent that “the people” regularly change its composition — and often its partisan control — in two-year intervals.

Beginning in 1910, however, a rare path around the Speaker and the Rules Committee emerged: the so-called discharge petition, which, if signed by a simple majority of members, forces legislation to the floor for an immediate vote. It’s been used to bypass House leadership four times in the roughly two years since Mike Johnson became Speaker. That’s quite the historical anomaly, and it says a lot about the weakness of the current Speaker.

Until recently, discharge petitions were sparsely employed. As an AEI history of the procedure explains, as of 2023, “less than 4 percent of the 638 petitions begun since 1935 got the requisite 218 signatures, and something like 8 percent of bills targeted for discharge were passed by the House.”

Indeed, prior to Johnson’s ascent to the Speakership, only two 21st-century discharge petitions achieved the 218 signatures needed to trigger a floor vote. One, in 2002, forced a successful vote on the famous McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. The next, in 2015, forced a successful vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, an object of hatred for many conservative Republicans. The latter dispute was, at the time, interpreted as one of many signs of then-Speaker John Boehner’s weakness.

The Johnson-era discharge petitions similarly show he has less than an iron fist. The first, in September of 2024, involved bottled-up legislation to relieve public employees of a cut in retirement benefits; it was subsequently passed by both houses and signed by President Joe Biden near the end of his term. But the second, third, and fourth happened in quick succession in the autumn of this year.

There was the most famous: the Democrat-generated petition to force a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Johnson’s futile efforts to head off its success had much to do with his decision to keep the House from meeting before and throughout the longest government shutdown in history. But he couldn’t stop it forever, and eventually he (along with Donald Trump and most congressional Republicans) surrendered and backed the bill. Then another Democrat-created petition, which hit 218 signatures in late November and forced a successful vote on a bill to reverse Trump’s efforts to kill collective-bargaining rights among federal employees. And the latest, filed just last week, will force a vote on a “clean” extension of expiring Obamacare premium subsidies. Sponsored by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was joined by four House Republicans frustrated with Johnson’s refusal to allow any sort of vote on the subsidies. The vote will take place once the House returns from its Christmas break in January.

You can argue that the sudden frequency of discharge petitions in Johnson’s House is mostly the product of exceptionally narrow party control (at present, the Republicans have just a three-vote majority). But Pelosi had some periods of very narrow partisan control during her last two years as Speaker, 2021 and 2022, and never faced this sort of open revolt.

Without question, Johnson’s grip on the gavel is becoming slippery. The odds are high he’ll lose it in next year’s midterm elections. But signs of weakness invite further revolts by House members who fear voters more than this mild-mannered former backbencher from Louisiana, whose authority is totally dependent on Trump’s backing, which can be erratic during times when the president is distracted by nonlegislative matters like ending wars and naming things after himself. Politicians, like guard dogs, can smell fear and irresolution. If discharge petitions keep popping up and forcing votes, Johnson may lose control of the House altogether and not even make it to the midterms as Speaker.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/349/584/0e629e1a77c3c33b5562465455ef2235ee-Mike-Johnson-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:35.954060

SoftBank pledged in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with $10 billion delivered immediately.
SoftBank’s aggressive push to fund OpenAI illustrates the high stakes of the AI race and the lengths even the world’s most seasoned investors will go to secure a foothold in the sector.","SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by the end of the year, employing a mix of cash-raising strategies that include selling stakes in major holdings and leveraging margin loans, sources told Reuters. The push marks one of the boldest moves yet by CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire aims to strengthen SoftBank’s position in the increasingly competitive artificial intelligence sector.

To assemble the necessary capital, Son has already sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia, offloaded $4.8 billion in T-Mobile US shares, and implemented staff reductions across the group. Dealmaking at SoftBank’s Vision Fund has slowed dramatically, with any investment exceeding $50 million now requiring Son’s explicit approval, sources said.

In addition to divestments, SoftBank is moving forward with its plan to take its payments operator PayPay public. Originally slated for this month, the initial public offering was delayed due to the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. The debut is now expected in the first quarter of next year and could raise more than $20 billion, according to sources familiar with the process.

SoftBank is also exploring partial exits from its holdings in Didi Global, China’s major ride-hailing operator. Didi plans to relist in Hong Kong after a U.S. delisting in 2021, following a regulatory crackdown, a source said. Vision Fund managers are being directed to prioritize the OpenAI deal over other opportunities.

The urgency to secure funds underscores the financial strain even the largest global investors face as they seek to finance massive AI projects, including data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars. SoftBank has multiple avenues to tap, including cash on its balance sheet, corporate bonds, margin loans, and stakes in listed companies.

A significant source of capital could come from SoftBank’s undrawn margin loans backed by its 100% ownership of Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor and software design company. The firm recently expanded this borrowing capacity by $6.5 billion, bringing total undrawn loans to $11.5 billion. Arm’s stock has more than tripled since its IPO, giving SoftBank additional collateral to support new borrowing.

As of September 30, SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen ($27.16 billion) and still holds about 4% of T-Mobile US, valued at roughly $11 billion. Despite slowing new investments, the company has continued backing AI startups including Sierra and Skild AI.

The funding is critical for OpenAI, which, alongside SoftBank, is investing in Stargate, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centers for training and inference. These centers are considered crucial to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in AI against China. The push to expand data center capacity has also prompted tech giants like Meta to commit massive capital, raising concerns about potential overinvestment in the sector.

SoftBank pledged in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with $10 billion delivered immediately. The remaining funds were contingent on OpenAI transitioning to a for-profit structure by year-end—a milestone it achieved in October.

The new capital will help OpenAI cover soaring costs for training and operating its AI models as competition intensifies from Google’s Gemini and other rivals. CEO Sam Altman recently described the company as entering a “code red” phase to enhance ChatGPT, temporarily delaying other product rollouts. OpenAI’s long-term ambitions remain staggering: Altman has outlined plans to build 30 gigawatts of computing capacity for $1.4 trillion and ultimately add one gigawatt of compute per week, with each gigawatt costing over $40 billion.

Gemini 3 Flash benchmark performance is stellar: 78.0% on SWE-bench Verified, 95.2% on AIME 2025, 33.7% on HLE. This beats Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 overall and comes close to Gemini 3 Pro, even beating the latter on SWE-Bench Verified.

Gemini 3 Flash is trained for broad usage across real-time workflows and agentic applications, and Google is deploying it widely, using it as the new default in the Gemini app, AI Mode in Google Search, and Google’s developer tools such as Gemini API, Android Studio, and Vertex AI. The API cost for Gemini 3 Flash is $0.50/M input tokens and $3.00/M output tokens, higher than Gemini 2.5 Flash but significantly less than competing similar-performing AI models. This makes Gemini 3 Flash a good daily driver AI model for many use cases.

And the settings, which sit in a revamped Personalization menu, allow people to opt for More, Less, or Default for any given characteristic and add new toggles that determine whether the bot will write headers and lists. It’s a minor UI change with major implications: Users no longer have to constantly tap for “less peppy” or “friendlier” replies, while teams can adjust the AI’s tone more closely to brand or context.

What’s New in ChatGPT Personalization Settings

The Personalization controls are more like Grecian Formula than personality transplants. Want energetic brainstorming? Set enthusiasm to More. Need a neutral compliance summary? (Set Less for warmth and emoji use here.) The additions supplement the November trio of base styles Professional, Candid, and Quirky, so users can add a general tone along with more specific tweaks. OpenAI also factored in preferences for structural choices, enabling the assistant to default to including lists and headers for scannability or just stick with plain paragraphs if a narrative answer is more appropriate.

Why Tone Control Matters for ChatGPT Users

ChatGPT’s tone has been a flashpoint all year. One update was a little too agreeable and swept into reverse when users objected to “sycophantic” behavior. It then adjusted its latest model to be warmer after hearing that the responses were becoming too clinical. The new controls are a practical solution; instead of trying to secure a timeless voice that appeals to everyone, OpenAI is turning people loose on the volume knob for friendliness and flair.

There’s also a behavioral safety aspect. Researchers at Stanford and Anthropic have written about how big language models may be too ready to reproduce what users think, a trend critics worry could foster reliance or create echo chambers. Tinkering with enthusiasm and warmth — it won’t solve that altogether, but gives users and companies a way to “tone down the flattery,” to rein in gushing praise, and keep interactions more firmly grounded — particularly in delicate arenas like mental health counseling or news consumption.

Early Use Cases and Real-Life Examples for Teams

And support teams can standardize their replies by turning the warmth slider to More and keeping enthusiasm at Default, which would generate warm but not effusive messages. Recruiters can decrease or limit emojis for candidate outreach to appear more professional, while marketing teams can increase engagement around brainstorming content ideas. Teachers could opt for Less warmth, sunshiny esprit during grading, sounding purely neutral and reading plainly as opposed to cheerily.

The structure toggles matter, too. The assistant can be biased toward short bullet lists and headings if the analysts who are writing executive summaries tend to do so, or the opposite, if, with complex legal issues, it is better to use flowing prose. There’s also a tangential upside in instant efficiency: A few key settings can cut down on the kind of redundant guidelines (there are no emojis here!) or suggestions like “list, not paragraphs,” which can free up some tokens and help keep responses more consistent among your team anyway.

How It Fits With the Other Controls Already in Place

These dials stack on top of system instructions, custom profiles, and base style presets. Base styles are like the general color palette, and the new controls are saturation and brightness sliders. Companies that employ admin policies can set defaults that suit their brand voice and let users dial it in to individual preferences. At a high level this negates the need for power-users to default to tone design through verbose prompts, by considering it as a first-class stateful setting.

Limitations and Open Questions for Tone Controls

You can then use these weights to refine the results returned by PageRank according to your particular preferences. These controls are purposefully straightforward (More, Less, Default) and you won’t be assured of producing consistent outputs across all queries or domains. Context still helps; technical and creative topics naturally lend themselves to cooler and flashier terms. It’s also not clear how these settings interact with shared workspaces, if org-level defaults outweigh user preferences, and how the model weighs several settings if they contradict (for instance, high enthusiasm but low emoji use).

The Broader Context of AI Controllability

Steerability — the ability for a user to have some control over style without losing substance — is an emerging battleground. Microsoft’s writing assistants and productivity tools already include controls for tone, like Formal or Casual, as enterprise buyers increasingly demand governance features that lock down voice and guard against behavioral drift. Analysts at organizations such as Gartner have described controllability as a cornerstone in scaling responsible generative AI, because it helps maintain brand consistency, cut prompt variance and achieve compliance expectations.

OpenAI’s decision does not halt arguments about how models should behave, but it does alter the balance of power toward users. Rather than suffering through a one-size-fits-all personality, you can set the vibe once and then get on with it. For everyone who is sick of getting encouraged when they just wanted the facts — or conversely, wished the bot sounded less like a tax memo — that’s a welcome change.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai_adds_passion_controls_to_chatgpt_tone_setti_edited_1766268246.png,N,,2025-12-20 20:58:42.900827

It’s another record for the sector, and further evidence that concerns around an AI slowdown haven’t dampened investor enthusiasm.

AI Infrastructure Demand Drives Record Deals

S&P Global credits the increase to hyperscale buildouts intended to service compute-hungry training and inference workloads. Cloud providers and AI platform operators are locking up multi-year capacity, usually pre-leasing entire campuses prior to breaking ground. Sorry, there are no AI applications in the world that prove killer at scale. However, industry consultants speaking to CNBC noted that demand for these kinds of AI workloads is robust in the data center: GPU clusters, high-density racks, and specialized networking still fetch premium prices.

Markets with available power and fiber—such as Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” Phoenix, Dallas, or parts of Ohio—still attract mega-campuses, while Europe’s main hubs like Frankfurt and Dublin are limited by permitting constraints and grid capacity. Developers are also branching out in so-called second-tier metros where utilities can act more quickly, and combining sites with long-term renewable power contracts to help businesses meet corporate sustainability goals.

Private Equity Drives the Financing Wave

Behind the headline number, a majority of financing is private equity and structured debt, S&P Global notes. That’s partly because of the sheer capital intensity of modern campuses — often billions per site — and rising interest rates, making buyers with cash and flexible balance sheets more attractive. Big infrastructure funds and alternative asset managers have swooped down through platform acquisitions, joint ventures, and sale-leasebacks, exchanging stable, contracted cash flows for more leverage.

The model is not foolproof. These debt-laden structures rely on fast delivery schedules, consistent lease-up, and cheap power. Running behind schedule for utility interconnections, the supply of GPUs, or a halt in AI spending could reduce returns. Yet with committed anchors in place and 10- to 20-year power and land strategies, many operators argue that, at their core, the fundamentals look more like those of infrastructure than cyclical tech.

Power and Land Limits Define Development Strategy

Capacity is as much a question of electricity — no longer just real estate. An S&P Global outlook predicted that data center power draw — currently on pace to grow by around 22% over the planning period, and potentially triple by decade’s end — accounted for roughly 2% of global electricity demand last year. That is in line with trends monitored by the International Energy Agency and Uptime Institute that indicate longer interconnection queues, transformer constraints, and competition with industrial loads.

Operators are adapting with multi-pronged strategies:

Secure a renewable PPA several years ahead of time

Design for liquid cooling to support high-density AI nodes

Co-locate facilities next to generation

Investigate on-site resources like battery storage or fuel cells to work around grid constraints

In some metros, utilities have made queuing reforms or phased caps a condition for interconnection, which has forced developers to divide campuses between service territories in order to spread risk.

Community Pushback and the Policy Response

As investors rush ahead, local opposition is gaining strength. A coalition of more than 300 environmental and civic groups recently asked governors and state regulators to pause approvals of large-scale data centers until they could demand better assessments of water use, emissions, and grid impacts. In some cases, community challenges have delayed or altered projects in locales like Virginia and Wisconsin, where residents and advocacy organizations have voiced concerns about noise, diesel backup generators, and tax incentives.

Policymakers are pulling in divergent directions. Some state and federal officials are trying to expedite permits for AI infrastructure; others are adding guardrails on siting, water withdrawals, and energy acquisition. European regulators, meanwhile, are raising the bar for efficiency reporting and heat-reuse requirements that might also affect design decisions worldwide.

Investor and Operator Outlook for Data Centers

What follows will depend on three variables: the availability of power, the supply of chips, and the cost of capital. If utilities can add capacity quickly enough, and if buyers of AI maintain multi-year commitments, today’s pipeline may translate into reliable cash flows linked to inflation. If not, the dollars will probably increasingly flow to markets equipped with faster interconnects and modular design, as well as hybrid models that offer wholesale, colocation, and build-to-suit capabilities.

For now, the number that counts is $61 billion. It’s a portrait of an industry in full buildout mode, with capital pursuing compute as AI moves from pilots to production. As the researchers and market analysts of S&P Global point out to CNBC and other outlets, the bottlenecks are real — but so is the demand.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1766264524.png,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:39.817370

Airports in New York, Tampa, Chicago, Dallas, Des Moines, and more are seeing widespread impacts as flight schedules are heavily affected. Weather conditions, airport congestion, and increased air traffic volumes are major contributors to these delays. Passengers are experiencing long wait times and frustration, with many flights being delayed or canceled at some of the busiest airports in the country.

As a result, travelers are being advised to stay updated on their flight statuses and contact airlines for rebooking options. With major cities like New York, Chicago, and Dallas reporting significant disruptions, this has become one of the most challenging travel days of the year for many.

Disruption Causes: Reasons Behind the Delays

Today, travelers across the U.S. are facing significant disruptions with 4,603 delays and 257 cancellations reported. These widespread travel issues, affecting major airports and airlines, are primarily caused by factors like weather conditions, airport congestion, and increased volumes, leading to longer wait times for passengers.

At Aspen/Pitkin County Airport (ASE), low ceilings are causing an average delay of 112 minutes, as poor visibility forces aircraft to hold or delay departures. Akron-Canton Airport (CAK) is experiencing delays due to deicing procedures, essential for flight safety when ice forms on aircraft. Eagle County Airport (EGE) reports 100-minute delays due to high airport volume, especially during peak travel times, leading to congestion and slower processing. Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is dealing with 45-minute delays (and increasing), as both high air traffic volume and weather-related factors intensify the situation.

Westchester County Airport (HPN) has an average 30-minute delay caused by departure volume, as the number of departing flights exceeds capacity. San Diego International Airport (SAN) is also affected by high volumes, leading to progressively longer delays. At Teterboro Airport (TEB), traffic management initiatives are causing 90-minute delays, while Van Nuys Airport (VNY) is experiencing delays due to compact demand, as a high volume of flights operates within limited time frames.

Airports affected across U.S.

Major airports across the U.S. are facing significant disruptions today. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) leads with 30 cancellations and 402 delays, making it one of the hardest-hit airports. Los Angeles International (LAX) follows closely with 19 cancellations and 233 delays, contributing to widespread travel challenges. Newark Liberty International (EWR) is also affected, reporting 17 cancellations and 155 delays, highlighting the busy airport’s struggle to manage traffic. Dallas-Fort Worth International (DFW) is experiencing 14 cancellations and 223 delays, impacting travelers flying in and out of Dallas. Similarly, Orlando International (MCO) reports 14 cancellations and 155 delays, leaving many passengers frustrated as they face long wait times.

U.S. Airlines affected

Today, several major U.S. airlines are experiencing significant disruptions with cancellations and delays affecting thousands of passengers. PSA Airlines, operating for American Airlines, has experienced the highest number of cancellations today, with 43 cancellations and 125 delays. Delta Air Lines is one of the most impacted, reporting 35 cancellations and 370 delays. Southwest Airlines follows closely, with 29 cancellations and a staggering 727 delays, significantly affecting its extensive domestic network. Spirit Airlines has also been hit hard, with 37 cancellations and 166 delays, while American Airlines is managing 3 cancellations and 423 delays. United Airlines reports 12 cancellations and 308 delays, contributing to widespread frustration at major airports.

Impact on Passengers: What Travelers Can Do Now

U.S. Travelers facing delays today due to low ceilings, deicing, airport congestion, and increased volumes should take several steps to manage the situation. First, it’s essential to stay informed about flight status by regularly checking updates, as departure times may change depending on airport conditions. If experiencing extended delays or cancellations, contact your airline for rebooking or compensation options, as many airlines offer alternate flights or vouchers.

Conclusion

Today’s flight disruptions across U.S. airports are largely due to factors such as weather conditions, airport congestion, and high volumes of air traffic. Passengers traveling through affected airports like ASE, EWR, HPN, SAN, and VNY should be prepared for delays and make sure to stay informed about the status of their flights. With over 4,603 delays and 257 cancellations, flexibility, and communication with airlines are key to managing the day’s challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-travel.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:26.613993

FCMB posts strong earnings, recapitalization on track Founded in 1982 by Otunba Subomi Balogun, FCMB has grown into one of Nigeria’s leading financial groups, serving retail, commercial and institutional clients.
Under Ladi Balogun, the bank has expanded its income base and posted solid results in a high-interest-rate environment.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, FCMB reported gross earnings of N828.1 billion ($570 million), up 40.9 percent from a year earlier.
Total assets stood at N7.23 trillion ($4.97 billion), while assets under management rose to N1.59 trillion ($1.09 billion).","FCMB Group, a financial services holding company led by Nigerian banking executive Ladi Balogun, has secured shareholder approval to raise up to N400 billion ($274 million), a move that clears a major hurdle as the Nigerian financial services holding company works to retain its international banking license and comply with new regulatory capital requirements.

The approval was granted at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), where shareholders endorsed an expanded capital plan that management says will place the group well ahead of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s March 2026 recapitalization deadline. For FCMB, this offers both regulatory breathing room and a vote of confidence after a year of strong earnings growth.

FCMB funds growth, tech, offshore expansion

In a filing with the Nigerian Exchange, the group said its banking subsidiary is already on course to meet the higher capital threshold. FCMB noted that it has completed a public offer and expects to close the sale of a minority stake in one of its units before the end of December.

“Subject to capital verification by the CBN, shareholder approval and the required regulatory consents, we are positioned to deliver the N500 billion capital target ahead of the March 2026 deadline for FCMB Limited,” the company said in the filing.

Speaking at the meeting, Group CEO Ladi Balogun thanked shareholders for their backing and said the additional funds would be used carefully, with a focus on balance sheet strength and long-term returns. He added that the capital will help improve capital adequacy, lower reliance on expensive deposits, and support investments in staff, technology and its offshore operations.

Strong returns expected for shareholders

Balogun also outlined expectations for shareholder returns, saying the group expects earnings per share to rise by more than 50 percent on average over the next two years. He added that a stronger capital position should support higher dividend payments, with the capital adequacy ratio projected to remain above 20 percent.

Shareholders also approved the acceptance of oversubscription from the group’s 2025 public offer, subject to limits set by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory approvals. FCMB said the oversubscription reflects strong investor demand for its shares.

As part of the resolution, FCMB’s issued share capital will increase from N30 billion through the creation of additional ordinary shares required to complete the capital raise. The new shares will rank equally with existing shares.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, FCMB reported gross earnings of N828.1 billion ($570 million), up 40.9 percent from a year earlier. Interest income climbed 64.7 percent, offsetting a decline in non-interest income caused by lower currency revaluation gains. Profit after tax rose 52 percent to N125.45 billion ($86.2 million), lifting return on average equity to 22.4 percent.

Total assets stood at N7.23 trillion ($4.97 billion), while assets under management rose to N1.59 trillion ($1.09 billion). Retained earnings increased to N291.9 billion ($200.6 million). With capital verification underway and regulatory approvals pending, FCMB says it remains on track to complete its recapitalization well before the 2026 deadline, positioning the group for growth.",https://www.billionaires.africa/content/images/2025/12/Ladi-Balogun-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:51.430959

And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions.That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have “interline agreements” that let them put stranded customers on another carrier’s flights.This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That’s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.“When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,” said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.“They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,” and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn’t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.AAA advises travelers to “continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,” spokesperson Diaz said. “Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.”Planning ahead for 2025Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.“Because travel is so popular, you’re not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,” Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. “If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.”

Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it’s beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.

The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year’s Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019.

Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.

A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.

What will be the busiest travel days?

Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day.

The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.

About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.

“Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,” AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.

This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.

Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That’s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.

“When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,” said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.

People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.

“They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,” and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.

Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.

Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.

Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?

A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn’t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.

More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.

“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.

AAA advises travelers to “continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,” spokesperson Diaz said. “Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.”

Planning ahead for 2025

Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.

“Because travel is so popular, you’re not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,” Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. “If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.”","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/xna-travelers-november-2025-692372bb42fd7.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-20 17:02:11.299151

And yet many of the same questions and challenges remain: Who gets left behind when public health systems collapse under political pressure or moral panic?
In a time of renewed political backlash and public health failures, GMHC’s story is more than history – it’s a guide.","The story of the AIDS movement is one of regular people: students, bartenders, stay-at-home mothers, teachers, retired lawyers, immigrants, Catholic nuns, newly out gay men who had just arrived in New York, and many others. Some had lost friends or lovers. Some felt a moral calling. Some were just trying to balance their sexual karma. Many were angry. Most had no medical background or professional credentials – just a sense of urgency, tenacity and an unwillingness to look away.

When Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the world’s first AIDS service organization, was founded in 1982, it was regular people trying to meet the needs of all people living with AIDS. Its workforce of volunteers provided HIV prevention education as well as physical, emotional and legal support.

At the start of the epidemic, AIDS was considered a “gay plague,” and to be openly queer was to risk abandonment, eviction, assault or worse. Families disowned their children. Hospitals turned patients away. Funeral homes refused bodies. And many people with AIDS found themselves alone and in need.

Public officials didn’t just fail to act – they refused to acknowledge that anything was happening at all. Elected leaders such as President Ronald Reagan and Sen. Jesse Helms stoked the moral panic guiding public policy by declaring people with AIDS “perverted human being(s).”

In 2025, with the Trump administration cutting federal funding for HIV research and support services and restricting protections and services for LGBTQ+ people, studying how everyday people approached the early AIDS crisis provides a model for surviving through innovation, commitment and community.

Stories informing the present

“I think 26,000 people died before (Reagan) even bothered to utter the word ‘AIDS,’” said Tim Sweeney, former executive director of Gay Men’s Health Crisis.

This quote is featured in the GMHC Stories Oral History Project, a collection of over 100 interviews with former volunteers, staff and donors from the first 15 years of the organization. Along with our colleague Julia Haager, we and our team at Binghamton University’s Human Sexualities Lab compiled these interviews. Acquired by the Manuscripts and Archives Division of The New York Public Library, the collection is scheduled to open in fall 2025, showcasing how everyday people responded to the AIDS crisis.

These stories document how a community presented with a set of circumstances threatening their very existence built a self-sustaining organization to advocate for and provide care to each other outside institutional support. They did this while enduring grief, standing up to external threats and navigating internal tensions.

Improvisation for survival

The work was an ongoing challenge. Organizations dedicated to aiding people affected by AIDS such as Gay Men’s Health Crisis were left to fund their own survival – and defend their right to do the work. When North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms moved in 1988 to eliminate federal support for AIDS service programs that mentioned homosexuality, it severely limited AIDS prevention efforts nation wide. However, GMHC had the foresight to fund its more explicit education materials with private donations.

At the beginning of the epidemic, queer New Yorkers and their allies had to improvise new systems of care in the absence of state and federal support. “People often (ask) me, what was the model you worked off of?” said Sweeney. “And I said, there was no model, there was just a muddle. We just made it up the whole time.”

What they created almost overnight was staggering. “There were over 1,000 volunteers in the agency,” recalled staff member Tom Weber, who started at GMHC as an office volunteer in 1988. “We would have orientations every single week, and they would flood in.”

One of the most well-known expressions of that volunteer labor was the buddy program, where lay caregivers provided emotional and practical support to people living with AIDS. “A lot of people were not alone in their death because of the work that we did,” said Barbara Danish, who led the buddy program from 1996 to 2002.

Education and prevention were also grounded in queer culture and community. Unlike early depictions of AIDS in the media that reduced patients to “vectors” of transmission, it was defiantly sex-positive. “We came up with shit that no one in the world had ever done,” Sweeney said. “Because finally it was gay men saying … we’re going to talk to each other about how to stay safe, healthy and sexy.”

When that sense of mission extended to emotional survival, humor and unapologetically queer culture were critical to bearing the weight of the work. “Sometimes you just break down and cry for an hour. But that’s how you survive it – by staying authentic to your emotions,” said Tommy Thomson, former director of client programs. She recalled how staff member “Carolotta,” or Carl, would sometimes put condoms and chocolate in a basket and go from office to office, frequently in drag. He would offer either or both to make people feel better. “He’d make you remember that you weren’t alone, and that we all know how hard it is. That’s part of what held you together.”

Internal tensions

Although Gay Men’s Health Crisis remained mission-driven, its internal politics were never simple. As it grew in size and national stature, it confronted the limits of its founding identity.

Founded by, and initially serving, primarily white gay men, GMHC sometimes struggled to adapt to the emerging realities of the epidemic. While AIDS also affected people of color, women and intravenous drug users from the outset, much of the agency’s early prevention and outreach work was designed with gay men in mind.

By the late 1980s, the increase in AIDS cases among white gay men had begun to plateau, while rates among Black and Latino people, women and IV drug users continued to rise sharply into the next decade. Women and people of color who were deeply embedded in GMHC’s operations nonetheless had to navigate assumptions about whose needs were prioritized – assumptions that often manifested in how resources were allocated and services were designed. As GMHC expanded its outreach to Black and Latino populations, it struggled to be culturally responsive and build trust in communities that had long been underserved and stigmatized.

As GMHC grew, it became more and more successful in fundraising and visibility, while smaller organizations sometimes struggled to access resources. This led to growing tensions, particularly in communities of color, where local groups feared that GMHC’s expansion would limit funding and undercut their efforts at community-specific approaches to care and prevention. In addition, efforts to address racism, sexism and cultural insensitivity encountered both support and indifference.

Yet, staff and volunteers continued to push – reshaping messaging, fighting for inclusive programming, and holding conversations about race, gender, power and public health. For staff and volunteers, the agency was a complicated institution that could both empower and marginalize. Its strength, and its struggle, was learning how to expand without losing sight of the legacy and history it was built on.

A guide for today

Forty years later, LGBTQ+ people face a new set of crises in a landscape riddled with dangers.

Trans health care is being banned in multiple states. Book bans and surveillance laws are targeting queer youth. Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is fueling violence and censorship. Funding for HIV prevention and research is disappearing even as new infections persist. Black and brown communities still face disproportionate barriers to health care and housing. Decades of scientific progress and medical discoveries are coming to a halt with funding cuts under the Trump administration.

And yet many of the same questions and challenges remain: Who gets left behind when public health systems collapse under political pressure or moral panic? Who will do the work when institutions fail? What does it mean to care for one another in the midst of the wreckage? How do people come together across differences?

The history of GMHC is more than memory – it is a lesson in the possibility of care, creativity and community, especially in the face of fear and uncertainty today. It shows how people can come together – not just to demand policy change, but to directly meet one another’s needs with whatever resources they have. It is a reminder that mutual aid is powerful; that grief can coexist with joy; and that queer resilience has always included laughter, desire and shared vulnerability. In a time of renewed political backlash and public health failures, GMHC’s story is more than history – it’s a guide. Today, the staff and volunteers at GMHC continue their work to confront the epidemic and uplift the lives of all people affected by AIDS.

“We’d say to them, ‘You’re just ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things,’” Sweeney said. “And we really meant that.”

What was once met with caution, policy debates and outright bans is now being woven into the daily rhythm of academic life. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is emerging as an early beneficiary of that shift, quietly securing a foothold in higher education as universities rethink how students learn, research and work.

Across public university systems, ChatGPT is no longer treated as a fringe study tool. Institutions are increasingly licensing the platform for broad use among students and faculty, signaling a move away from enforcement toward education. The change reflects a growing belief that generative AI is not a temporary disruption but a permanent presence in modern learning.

ChatGPT finds early footing on campuses

OpenAI has sold more than 700,000 ChatGPT licenses across about 35 public universities, according to Bloomberg. These agreements typically cover both students and faculty, positioning the software as a general-purpose academic assistant rather than a single-use product.

On campuses, ChatGPT is being used for writing support, coding help, data analysis and research preparation. Faculty members rely on it to streamline administrative tasks and curriculum planning, while students turn to it as an everyday aid for organizing ideas and solving problems. That wide range of uses has helped normalize the tool within academic environments that once viewed AI with skepticism.

Unlike earlier educational technologies that arrived through top-down mandates, ChatGPT has spread partly through student demand. Many undergraduates arrive already familiar with the platform, having used it before enrolling. Universities that adopt it formally are often responding to existing behavior rather than introducing something entirely new.

Why students gravitate toward ChatGPT

While major competitors also offer AI tools, adoption patterns suggest a divide in how those products are used. Microsoft’s Copilot, often bundled into enterprise software agreements, tends to see heavier use among faculty and administrative staff. ChatGPT, by contrast, has gained traction as a standalone product that students actively seek out.

That distinction matters. Tools chosen voluntarily are more likely to shape habits, especially during formative years. As students integrate ChatGPT into their workflows, faculty are adjusting assignments and expectations, reinforcing its role rather than attempting to restrict it.

OpenAI appears intent on reaching users early, before academic routines and professional habits are firmly established. The strategy mirrors how other digital platforms gained long-term influence by becoming familiar during school years.

Teaching responsible use instead of bans

Universities are increasingly framing AI as something to be taught responsibly rather than prohibited. Many institutions now focus on guiding students in ethical use, verification of outputs and understanding limitations. This approach reflects a broader shift in academic culture, one that recognizes AI literacy as a necessary skill.

The change also acknowledges reality. Policing AI use has proven difficult, while thoughtful integration offers a chance to shape how students engage with emerging technology. For administrators, the question is no longer whether students will use AI, but how.

Education’s role in OpenAI’s bigger ambitions

OpenAI’s expanding presence in higher education comes as the company’s ambitions continue to grow. Separate reports indicate it has held early discussions with investors about raising up to $100 billion at a valuation near $750 billion, up sharply from the roughly $500 billion figure tied to a secondary share sale earlier this year.

The company is also widely reported to be laying groundwork for a future initial public offering, potentially as soon as 2026, with some projections placing its value close to $1 trillion. Those figures highlight how central scale and long-term adoption are to OpenAI’s strategy.

Education plays a unique role in that vision. If ChatGPT becomes the default AI assistant for students today, it may influence how future workers write, code and think. In a crowded AI market, familiarity can translate into loyalty.

For now, OpenAI’s growing presence on campuses reflects a broader reality. Artificial intelligence is no longer an experiment in higher education. It is becoming part of the infrastructure.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2378605551.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 19:01:40.727693

The forecast arrives as content leaders face escalating demands—95.2% consider visual content critical for business communications, according to Adobe research cited in the report. Content needs are growing between five and twenty times current levels.

The report synthesized extensive internal and external research alongside feedback from Adobe Creative Cloud communities. According to Deepa Subramaniam, Vice President of Product Marketing for Creative Professionals at Adobe, creativity now faces a ""perfect storm"" of soaring content demands, reduced resources, and transformative AI capabilities. ""The most forward-thinking teams aren't just adding new tools,"" Subramaniam stated in the report. ""They're building systems that bring people, ideas, and workflows together in a more connected, collaborative way.""

Four trends emerged from Adobe's analysis. Each addresses different aspects of visual communication, from sensory engagement to cultural authenticity.

Multisensory visual experiences

The first trend emphasizes creating content that engages multiple senses simultaneously through texture, motion, sound, and implied sensory qualities. Research cited by The Drum showed 82% of global consumers expect their senses engaged when experiencing new content.

Brenda Mills, Principal of Consumer and Creative Insights at Adobe, explained the shift in the report. ""Our lives are so screen-focused that, since the Covid shutdown, people have had an insatiable desire to have all their senses engaged,"" Mills stated. ""We are living in a crowded visual landscape, so people expect images to deliver more than ever before.""

WGSN research referenced in Adobe's report indicated 68% of customers want brands to create remarkable out-of-the-box campaigns. An additional 78% demonstrate higher likelihood to purchase from brands making them feel joy.

The technical implementation requires designing AI prompts describing more than visual appearance. Prompts must suggest how content might feel, sound, or smell. Audio elements become essential components rather than supplementary additions.

Corporate Reputation Review published research finding that engaging multiple senses significantly enhanced brand experience and customer satisfaction among Chinese consumers. The study suggested this pattern extends globally.

Adobe's GenStudio platform received significant expansions in October 2025, introducing proprietary AI model customization through Adobe Firefly Foundry. The platform integrated with major advertising systems including Amazon Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Innovid, LinkedIn, and TikTok.

Emotional connection through intentional craft

Adobe's second trend focuses on deliberately crafting moments that evoke shared human emotions. The approach, termed ""Connectioneering"" in the report, emphasizes authentic emotional resonance over promotional messaging.

Mills explained the fundamental motivation in the report. ""People really want to feel what connects us all to the special, valuable things that make us human,"" she stated.

Gallup research cited in Adobe's document indicated 95% of consumer decisions stem from emotional factors. Greenbook research found 70% of purchase decisions are shaped by an average of ten emotional needs.

The implementation requires setting up moments bridging regions and industries through universal emotional takeaways. Video content particularly benefits from music selection that captures and amplifies the intended mood. Every element reinforces the core spirit of the work.

The approach contrasts with purely informational advertising. Viewers stop noticing branding elements and instead experience the message directly through emotional engagement with shared joy, inspiration, or connection.

Research from multiple advertising studies throughout 2025 demonstrated consumer preferences for personalized content addressing emotional needs. Adobe's May 2025 study of over 1,000 Americans revealed specific preferences for brand engagement frequency and content personalization.

Surreal and playful design execution

Adobe's third trend encourages deliberately strange, humorous visual approaches that intrigue and entertain audiences. The surreal design strategy leverages generative AI capabilities to create imagery that stretches logic and bends physics.

VICE research cited in the report showed 68% of global youth actively search for humorous content providing escapism from reality.

Mills characterized the approach in the report. ""These are strange times, and if you can pivot and present strangeness in a humorous way, it's outrageously engaging and entertaining,"" she stated. ""It's an extremely clever approach I truly admire.""

Kantar research referenced in Adobe's forecast indicated brands described as fun and playful demonstrate significantly better performance in building future demand. Nutter Butter's TikTok series earned Social Campaign of the Year at the 2025 AdAge Creativity Awards by captivating Generation Z audiences through unexpected creative execution.

The technical enabler involves allowing generative AI tools like Adobe Firefly to operate without constraints forcing mimicry of existing visual conventions. Brands can discover entirely new aesthetic territories when AI systems imagine what doesn't currently exist rather than reproducing familiar patterns.

Industry research on creative trends throughout 2025 identified shifts toward dense, layered content particularly appealing to younger demographics. YouTube's September 2025 Culture & Trends report revealed ""Creative Maximalism"" as a dominant format incorporating multiple visual and audio information layers.

Local cultural authenticity

Adobe's fourth trend emphasizes partnering with local creators and spotlighting regional craftsmanship to achieve authentic representation. The approach positions locally rooted stories on global stages.

The trend emerges as Generation Z increasingly embraces ""appstinence""—conscious breaks from constant connectivity. This shift makes discovery of local cultures and communities more appealing than generic global content.

Mills explained the personalization aspect in the report. ""I work with a lot of enterprise customers for Adobe, and they're constantly asking for more authentic regional and local imagery so they can appeal to specific regions where their customers live,"" she stated. ""When people see themselves or their communities represented, it humanizes the company.""

Implementation requires stories belonging to communities rather than simply being about them. Collaboration with local talent both behind and in front of cameras becomes essential. Authentic cultural voices should remain unfiltered by translation or external interpretation.

Nike launched women's footwear in partnership with Delhi-based brand NorBlack NorWhite, according to CNN coverage cited in Adobe's report. The campaign used ancient tie-dyeing techniques and documented the work with Indian photographer Bharat Sikka.

Corona's ""Impossible Plants"" campaign in Japan addressed widespread vitamin D deficiency by encouraging sun exposure through imagery of plants sprouting through concrete, according to Muse by Clios coverage referenced in the forecast.

Visual discovery platforms like Pinterest introduced tools throughout 2025 enabling localized creative production. Pinterest announced AI-powered auto-collages in June 2025, transforming product catalogs into culturally relevant visual content.

AI's expanding role in creative production

The report positioned artificial intelligence as an enabler rather than replacement for human creativity. Tor Myhren, Vice President of Marketing Communications at Apple, stated in Adobe's forecast: ""While AI is the most exciting creative tool we have seen in our lifetime, the human touch is our superpower and the path to long-term brand love.""

Adobe emphasized commercially safe AI foundations trained on proprietary brand content. The approach addresses intellectual property concerns affecting some generative AI implementations.

Research from WPP Media in September 2025 found 71% of industry experts view AI-produced creative content as likely by 2030, with 29% considering it highly likely. The shift represents the largest positive movement from baseline measurements across any scenario examined.

Adobe's research cited in the trends report indicated 99% of Fortune 100 companies have used AI in Adobe applications. Nearly 90% of the company's top 50 enterprise accounts adopted AI-first innovations including GenStudio offerings.

Brands including The Coca-Cola Company, dentsu, The Estée Lauder Companies, Henkel, IBM, IPG Health, Lumen Technologies, Monks, The National Football League, Newell Brands, PepsiCo/Gatorade, Prudential Financial, Publicis Groupe, Qualcomm, Stagwell, and Tapestry have implemented Adobe's AI-powered systems, according to the report.

Adobe research indicated 62% of marketers surveyed experienced increased content production volume during the past year. Nearly two-thirds believe content demand will grow by at least five times between now and 2026.

Implementation considerations for marketing teams

Adobe's forecast provided practical guidance for applying each trend. The multisensory approach requires customizing brand colors, fonts, and textures while incorporating audio elements that complement visual content.

Emotional connection execution involves using collaborative AI-powered moodboards to spark new ideas within teams. Quick design tools can transform rough concepts into polished deliverables within minutes.

Surreal design implementation leverages diverse ecosystems of Adobe Firefly and partner models, providing choice and flexibility. Advertisers can maintain brand consistency while exploring imaginative creative territories through customized look-and-feel kits.

Local authenticity requires content localization to accommodate language and visual preferences regionally. Template customization enables adaptation while preserving core brand identity.

The report emphasized that successful implementation requires understanding authentic local voices rather than imposing external interpretations. When brands cannot physically access specific locations, collaboration with local talent becomes essential.

Marketing technology developments throughout 2025 demonstrated AI's transformation of customer engagement. Smartly's November 2025 research showed 92% of surveyed marketers reporting AI fundamentally redefines consumer connections.

Industry context and competitive landscape

Adobe's trends report arrives during significant advertising industry transformation. Global advertising spending reached $1.14 trillion in 2025, with commerce advertising surpassing television for the first time at $178.2 billion, according to WPP Media projections.

The creative production challenge intensifies as platforms demand increasing content variations. Facebook's advertising algorithms require minimum ten versions of ad images to optimize performance for specific users, demonstrating the scale of creative variation needed.

Brazilian agency GALERIA.ag announced in July 2025 a partnership committing R$10 million to Adobe GenStudio implementation. Adobe data cited in that announcement indicated GenStudio optimization delivers up to 70% reduction in go-to-market time for campaigns while centralizing asset management.

Industry research on AI adoption revealed cautious optimism among media professionals. Integral Ad Science's December 2025 report showed 61% of surveyed media experts expressed excitement about AI developments while 53% simultaneously cited unsuitable adjacencies as a top 2026 challenge.

The convergence of increasing content demands with expanding AI capabilities creates both opportunities and challenges. Adobe positioned its trends forecast as guidance for navigating this complexity while maintaining authentic human creativity.

Platform consolidation continues reshaping competitive dynamics. Google's advertising innovations and Meta's AI optimization systems demonstrate major platforms' commitment to automated creative production and optimization capabilities.

Market implications for creative professionals

The four trends identified by Adobe reflect broader shifts in consumer expectations and technological capabilities. Each trend addresses specific audience needs while leveraging AI tools to achieve scale impossible through manual production alone.

The multisensory approach responds to screen fatigue and desire for richer experiences. Emotional connection addresses automation anxiety by emphasizing human-centered storytelling. Surreal design provides entertainment value in attention-saturated environments. Local authenticity counters homogenization by celebrating cultural specificity.

Implementation requires balancing efficiency gains from AI automation with authentic human creativity that builds long-term brand relationships. The report emphasized that tools enable rather than replace creative talent.

Adobe provided curated collections, AI-powered moodboards, and customizable templates supporting each trend. These resources aim to accelerate adoption while maintaining creative quality standards.

The forecast aligns with broader industry predictions for 2026, which identified agentic AI, privacy-first identity infrastructure, and owned channel transformation as dominant themes reshaping marketing operations.

NewsNation's implementation of Adobe Express demonstrated practical applications of creative automation. The broadcaster reduced production time from hours to minutes using Adobe's tools, according to case study materials referenced in the trends report.

The creative trends forecast positions 2026 as a year where innovation and authenticity coexist rather than compete. Adobe emphasized that successful execution requires understanding both technological capabilities and enduring human creative principles.

The high three-year median payout ratio of 87% (that is, the company retains only 13% of its income) over the past three years for Medtronic suggests that the company's earnings growth was lower as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.

In addition, Medtronic has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 47% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.

Summary

Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Medtronic.

We recently published 10 Firms in the Limelight. Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) is one of the best performers on Friday.

Rocket Lab rallied for a second day on Friday, surging 17.69 percent to close at $70.52 apiece after bagging a potential billion-dollar contract to develop and produce satellites for the US Space Development Agency.

Touted as its largest single contract to date, Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) said that the partnership includes an $806 million base contract, $10.45 million in options, and opportunities for the supply of other items.

Under the base contract, Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) would manufacture 18 satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems.

Each satellite will feature its Phoenix infrared sensor payload, a wide field-of-view (WFOV) solution designed to meet the evolving missile defense needs of national security space, as well as advanced StarLite space protection sensors, designed to safeguard the constellation against directed energy threats.

Meanwhile, it would also supply items such as payloads, solar solutions, attitude determination and control components (ACDS), software, among others.

The contract forms part of the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 (TRKT3) program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA).

“Demand for resilient, scalable, and affordable space systems continues to grow, and this award demonstrates that Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in delivering solutions that meet the needs of national security,” said Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) CEO Peter Beck.

The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again.
Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace.
Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired.
Advt As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder.","Zara has quietly joined the growing list of fashion brands experimenting with artificial intelligence, and it’s already stirring conversation. The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again. The goal is pretty straightforward: faster visuals, fewer shoots, and quicker rollouts. But it also signals a bigger change in how fashion imagery is being made.

Zara isn’t alone in this. Earlier this year, H&M revealed it had created AI-generated versions of models for its marketing work, and Zalando has been using similar tools to speed up campaign production. Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace.

Advt

Zara’s parent company, Inditex, has been quick to clarify that AI isn’t here to replace humans. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a company spokesperson said. They added that models are kept in the loop, their consent is taken before any AI edits are made, and payments follow industry standards.

The details first came out through a report by London-based outlet CityAM. According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits. The model also shared that they were paid the same amount they would have earned if they had travelled for another shoot, which suggests brands are trying to tread carefully, at least for now.

H&M and Zalando have made similar statements, saying AI is meant to support creative teams, not replace them. Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, and production crews are still part of the process, even if technology helps brands work faster and cut costs behind the scenes.

What makes Zara’s move especially interesting is that Inditex chair Marta Ortega is known to be a big supporter of fashion photography. The daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega has often spoken about her love for the art form. Since 2021, her MOP Foundation gallery in A Coruña, the Spanish city where Zara began, has hosted exhibitions celebrating legendary photographers.

Advt

Right now, the gallery is showing Annie Leibovitz’s work, and previous exhibitions have highlighted names like Steven Meisel, a long-time Zara collaborator, and Helmut Newton. At the same time, Ortega has been pushing Zara towards a more premium feel, shutting down smaller stores and focusing on larger, more polished flagship spaces.

Still, not everyone is convinced this AI shift is harmless. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired. Her concern is that this won’t just affect big names in the industry, but also young creatives trying to get their first break.

Advt

As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder. And for now, the industry is still figuring out where exactly the line should be drawn.

Whether the plan requires a veto, in Johnson’s eyes, is the question of the hour.

But some holdouts are also reluctant to approve Johnson’s borrowing plan to cover firefighter backpay and police misconduct settlement costs.","The budget counterproposal crafted by opponents of Mayor Brandon Johnson won a critical first full City Council vote Friday, setting up the mayor to soon concede their remarkable weekslong fight — or issue Chicago’s first mayoral veto of a budget in decades.

Aldermen voted 29-19 to approve the revenue piece of an alternative 2026 spending plan that does not include Johnson’s corporate head tax. That’s shy of the 34-vote threshold needed to override a potential mayoral veto, however, leaving the door open for the City Hall standoff to escalate further still. And with under two weeks until an end-of-year deadline to approve a budget, all factions agree Chicago is inching too close for comfort to a government shutdown.

When the moment came Friday, aldermen debated for mere moments before quickly passing the plan.

“The city of Chicago’s financial position is at a critical juncture,” said Ald. Pat Dowell, Johnson’s handpicked Finance chair who played a critical role in the effort that outmuscled him. “And I think we have emerged today with a budget plan that protects programs which are vital to those most in need while setting on the right path toward a stronger fiscal future.”

The $16.6 billion aldermanic package contains a debt sale measure that Johnson has called Thursday “morally bankrupt” and his “red line.” His budget team warned such a novel proposal should not be counted on to raise any money at all, on top of attacking other components of the alternative budget that they argue is unbalanced and would require midyear amendments next year.

Whether the plan requires a veto, in Johnson’s eyes, is the question of the hour.

The rest of the budget package could face a vote as soon as Saturday. But in his post-council presser, the mayor sought to pump the brakes by insisting “negotiations are still prevalent. This process is not over just yet.”

“I haven’t made that decision yet,” Johnson said about a possible veto.

Johnson adviser Kennedy Bartley told reporters after the news conference that the administration believes the mayor would be able to make line item vetoes in key budget legislation, a sign he is weighing such a possibility.

Should Johnson follow through, he would be the first Chicago mayor to veto a budget plan since 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington rejected a revenue package approved by a majority bloc of aldermen. Johnson first threatened a mayoral veto last month on any budget that hikes property taxes or garbage fees but has been less committal about his council rivals’ current plan.

But he also took pains in his news conference Friday to try to frame the revenue package aldermen passed as a compromise, despite the fact the council has so far rejected his key corporate head tax provision and instead embraced the debt sale he has railed against.

He pointed to the increased and new taxes on leased personal property and social media companies to argue the passed plan pulls from businesses.

The mayor has also taken credit for his aldermanic opponents backing off a plan to increase garbage fees.“These are gains that, had we not put forth this fight, they would not exist,” he said.

And Johnson meanwhile introduced a revised budget plan of his own Friday that would replace the debt sale plan with the head tax. In the plan, the city would make a full advance pension payment Johnson had earlier proposed halving, not legalize video gambling terminals and count on slot machines being placed at a Midway Airport lounge.

Aldermen opposed to Johnson used a legislative maneuver to delay consideration of the mayor’s tweaked proposal.

Johnson’s head tax idea remains at a monthly $33-per-employee surcharge for companies over 500 workers in his latest ordinance, even after a majority of aldermen have repeatedly rejected versions of the levy in votes and letters. But the mayor on Friday refused to move on, comparing his fight to tax corporations to crusades for racial justice, gender equality and suffrage movements throughout American history.

“That fight is not over. Do you know how many times people fought for civil rights, women’s rights, the rights to vote?” Johnson said when asked why he won’t accept defeat. “Wouldn’t that have been a shame if we would have had that same question for people a generation ago? That you’ve lost it, why not give up?”

The mayor and his leftist allies have been admonishing the majority council bloc for weeks, say they are siding with rich corporations and billionaires. The war of words has also stood out from other budget fights in its campaign-style messaging from outside interests, pitting wealthy business-backed groups against the Johnson-allied Chicago Teachers Union and other progressive organizations.

But even the progressives were not united with Johnson, who first introduced his own $16.6 billion package in October but failed to make the case that his pitch to reinstate the city’s head tax, among other new revenue measures, was Chicago’s best hope to stand up to President Donald Trump. That his aldermanic rivals gained such ground over Johnson was not just because of his focus on the head tax but because they championed a full advance pension payment from the start.

That’s a requirement for many council members who say Chicago must stop kicking the can down the road with its fiscal obligations — or else risk a catastrophic credit downgrade. But some holdouts are also reluctant to approve Johnson’s borrowing plan to cover firefighter backpay and police misconduct settlement costs. The council counterproposal preserves that part of Johnson’s budget.

On Friday, Progressive Caucus members Aldermen Desmon Yancy, Ronnie Mosley and Ruth Cruz voted with the mayor’s opposition, while Ald. Andre Vasquez abstained. He later said on the floor he would have voted no but encountered technical difficulties.

Though progressive Ald. Matt Martin voted against the rival revenue package, he stressed that was because he wants to leverage both sides to nix the borrowing plan to pay for firefighter backpay and police settlements. Like his colleagues, he agreed a government shutdown “is the worst outcome, and that’s not going to happen.”

Asked if relations between the mayor’s office on the fifth floor and City Council had any hope of improving given that doomsday scenario, he took a long pause before saying, “I don’t know, honestly. I don’t know.”

Yancy, meanwhile, answered, “I guess the question is ‘Better than what?’ Right? The last couple of years has been really difficult. I think that has shown up in the way this budget conversation has gone.”

For his part Ald. Jason Ervin, Johnson’s pick to lead the powerful Budget Committee, argued afterward the vote did not signify an end to negotiations.

“I think that once the temperature dies down, folks go home for Christmas, take their pictures in their onesies and come back, I think we have a better result,” he said.

Asked if he believes the mayor should reject the spending plan he has criticized as unbalanced, he said “there are elements of it that should be vetoed.”

Outside chambers, Johnson’s empowered foes took a muted victory lap, with Ald. Brendan Reilly claiming the coalition was “awfully close” to winning over a veto-proof bloc of the council.

Dowell said that discussions should continue, as “a budget is a living document. It is a document that can be changed and modified, and if there are opportunities to do that or need to do that, we will.” She and her colleagues also disagreed with the mayor’s harsh rhetoric of that document.

“I don’t know what ‘morally bankrupt’ means,” Dowell said about Johnson’s ongoing criticism of their debt sale idea. “If you can explain that to me, I’ll answer the question.”

That Johnson’s third budget fight has gotten this combative shows how much the freshman mayor has lost control of the City Council. But Johnson himself may have inadvertently seen this coming months ago.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-city-council-budget-1.jpg?w=1024&h=664,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:25.715226

Фінальна мораль банальна і сто разів пережована: багатим теж несолодко, гроші руйнують їхній звʼязок з реальністю і з близькими.","Скандал, що лежить в основі подій фільму, свого часу прогримів на всю Європу. Головна акціонерка косметичної мегакорпорації L'Oréal Ліліан Беттанкур, чиї статки сягали майже 40 млрд доларів США, дійсно була найбагатшою жінкою світу. У 1987 році Беттанкур познайомилася з письменником, художником, світлиняром, відкритим ґеєм Франсуа-Марі Баньє, коли він фотографував її для французького журналу Égoiste. Вони стали дуже близькими друзями, по суті, платонічними коханцями — разом виходили у світ, розважались, подорожували.

Ліліан засипала Франсуа-Марі дуже коштовними подарунками (картини Пікассо, Матісса, Мондріана, Делоне і Леже, поліс страхування життя на суму € 253 млн — сума витрат склала € 1,3 млрд), навіть хотіла всиновити його. Дочка Ліліан, Франсуаза, яку вже давно непокоїв цей звʼязок, у 2007 році подала позов проти Баньє, звинувативши його в експлуатації фізичної або психологічної слабкості з метою особистої вигоди. Після розслідування і допитів справу передали до суду. Баньє засудили до двох з половиною років позбавлення волі та зобов'язали виплатити Ліліан 158 мільйонів євро як відшкодування збитків. Франсуа подав апеляцію. Другий судовий розгляд підтвердив вирок, але зупинив виконання тюремного ув'язнення та скасував відшкодування.

Режисер Тьєррі Кліф і його співсценаристи Седрік Анжер і Жак Фієскі змінили імена, але не обставини. Ліліан Беттанкур стала Маріанною Фаррер (Ізабель Юппер), Франсуа-Марі — П'єром-Аленом (Лоран Лафітт), Франсуаза — Фредерікою (Марина Фуа). Пролог тривожний: поліція проводить обшук у маєтку Фаррер, П'єра-Алена затримано, господиня спантеличена. Після цього режисер відступає в часі, аби показати, як поважна бізнес-леді дійшла до такого життя.

Цікаво, що на Netflix позаторік вийшов документальний мінісеріал про справу Беттанкур: «Мільярдерка, дворецький і бойфренд» (The Billionaire, the Butler and the Boyfriend). У ньому частину сцен проілюстровано ігровими реконструкціями за участю акторів. Тьєррі Кліф діє симетрично: вставляє в сюжет стилізовані під документальну зйомку інтервʼю з головними дійовими особами, що пригадують, як усе було. Щоправда, драматургічно це нічим не обумовлено: ЗМІ, медіа чи якась документалістська група в сюжеті не представлені. Здається, що режисер зробив ці «інтерв’ю», просто щоб переказати ті частини сюжету, які не вмістилися в основну історію. Загалом це, мабуть, головна біда фільму: в ньому багато слів, чимало персонажів, але повідомляє він недостатньо.

Юппер грає звичний для неї типаж жорсткої, уїдливої, зарозумілої героїні. Лоран Лафітт блискуче відпрацьовує таку собі комбінацію Тартюфа і Трумена Капоте, як його побачив Гас Ван Сент у серіалі «Капоте проти лебедів» (2024). Його П'єр-Ален — веселий цинік, зухвалий трикстер, чарівний у своєму нахабстві, артистично-безцеремонний. Його гасло — «Сміливим бути краще». Він вміло комбінує маскулінний натиск і жіночну кокетливість. Лафітт з Юппер створюють яскраву хімію між персонажами, і це, мабуть, найкраща частина фільму — єдина, правду кажучи, яка не викликає запитань.

А запитання є. Зрозуміло, чим П'єр-Ален приваблює Маріанну, але важливіше те, чому в неї взагалі виникла потреба в ньому. Що не так у її шлюбі? Чи надламав її тягар наступництва в бізнес-імперії? Чому вона настільки холодна і відсторонена з дочкою? Яку роль у цьому всьому зіграли пронацистські симпатії її батька, якого вона обожнювала? Відповіді, що визначають мотивації героїв, є у вищезазначеному серіалі Netflix, але не у фільмі.

І з цього випливає прикра драматична змазаність «Найбагатшої жінки світу». Юппер практично не змінюється, що б не відбувалося: на її обличчі не читається ані розгубленість, ані лють, ані умиротворення. Емоційні півтони заміщуються мелодраматичними прийомами (чого лише варта сцена в нічному клубі, коли знайома П'єра-Алена співає сльозливий шансон). Фінальна мораль банальна і сто разів пережована: багатим теж несолодко, гроші руйнують їхній звʼязок з реальністю і з близькими.

Але нащо було заради такого набору очевидностей витрачати аж дві години екранного часу?",https://i.lb.ua/119/53/694514e970bb9.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 11:03:07.070402
